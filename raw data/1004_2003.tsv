A Numerical Method to Generate Reference Trajectories for Optimization Methods to Support Low-Thrust Mission Design	2020-08-01	2018-07-19	The recent success of missions employing low thrust propulsion systems has demonstrated the promise this technology holds for a wide array of future applications, from asteroid tours, to missions to xxxxxx. Low-thrust spacecraft motion is governed by a sensitive system of nonlinear differential equations, and this makes finding desirable trajectories challenging. Current low-thrust trajectory design methods rely heavily on optimization techniques to obtain feasible trajectories. These techniques require an initial guess for the spacecraft trajectory and this guess heavily impacts the final optimized trajectory. Many locally optimal trajectories are available and a precise initial guess can lead to the most desirable locally, or even globally, optimal trajectory. Despite the importance of a good initial guess in low-thrust trajectory design, relatively few comprehensive methods exist for creating these guesses. A method for generating a wide array of initial guesses and selecting one that best fits a set of preferred criteria is desirable because it would expand the range of possible low-thrust trajectories. One tool that shows promise for developing initial guesses for low-thrust trajectories is the theory of invariant manifolds. In astrodynamics, invariant manifolds can be thought of as structures that show the natural flow of gravitational forces about a periodic orbit. The manifolds of low-thrust periodic orbits are likely helpful for producing a range of detailed initial guesses for low-thrust trajectories. The proposed investigation will study how the manifolds of low-thrust periodic orbits can be used to produce improved initial guesses for low-thrust spacecraft trajectories. The study will begin by computing low-thrust periodic orbits and obtaining the manifolds of these orbits. Following this, a variety of visualization methods will be employed to understand manifold behavior, these include Poincare maps and three-dimensional plots. The intuition gained from these visualizations will be used to develop a scheme for categorizing manifold behavior. Understanding gained from visualization and categorization will be applied to low-thrust mission design. A number of realistic mission scenarios will be tested, including polesitting orbits and transfers from the xxxxxxxxxxxx system to other bodies. It is important to note that a spacecraft can leverage the manifolds of a low-thrust periodic orbit without entering the orbit. Therefore, a low-thrust periodic orbit does not need to be the final destination of a spacecraft in order for this mission design method to be of use. The proposed mission design method will first identify low-thrust periodic orbits whose manifolds provide access to the desired regions of space. Next, the method will calculate the manifolds which provide the preferred trajectory characteristics at the lowest cost. The result of this determination will be used as an initial guess in an optimization technique. Finally, the resulting solution will be tested in a higher fidelity model. This entire process will be made as autonomous as possible to allow for ease of use by mission designers. The improved initial guesses generated by this method will produce superior locally optimal trajectories, which could entail fuel or time savings for spacecraft. Therefore, mission design strategies produced by this study could yield innovative trajectories that would reduce mission cost and increase scientific return. Furthermore, this research will yield methods for understanding the stability of low-thrust enabled periodic orbits. The potential of low-thrust spacecraft has only begun to be realized. Investment in astrodynamics research will expand the space attainable by these spacecraft, opening up new regions of space for science and exploration by xxxxxx and its partners.	13290

Double Bag VARTM for High Temperature Composites, Phase II	2010-09-01	2018-07-19	The process known as double bag vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (DBVARTM) was developed by xxxxxx to help deplete by products.  To date, the xxxxxx DBVARTM process has reduced void content to approximately four to five percent.  This number has fallen short of the goal of two percent.  During the xxxxxx I effort, xxxxxx (SDC) was able to reduce the void content to 0.8 percent to 1.5 percent.   There are three primary technical objectives to the xxxxxx effort.  The first objective is to perform a trade study to evaluate and optimize the effect of stitched performs.  Stitching has had a large effect on the void content in the laminate and several different stitching variables will be evaluated.  The second objective is to transition the work done in xxxxxx I to larger components.  These components will consist of larger plates and structures will be evaluated using non destructive testing along with mechanical testing.  At the end of the xxxxxx effort, a full scale component will be fabricated, evaluated using non destructive testing, and then the component will be tested. The final objective is to transition the technology to Boeing Phantom xxxxxx.  This objective will demonstrate that the process developed in a laboratory can be reproduced at any facility.  By the end of the xxxxxx program, the xxxxxx Readiness xxxxxx (xxxxxx) is expected to be 5-6.	13293
Remote UV Fluorescence Lifetime Spectrometer, Phase II	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	"The goal of this project is to develop, demonstrate, and deliver to xxxxxx an innovative, portable, and power efficient xxxxxx UV xxxxxx (RUVxxxxxxTM) for the in-situ robotic or manned crew planetary scientific exploration and investigation of surface and subsurface geophysical terrain. The RUVxxxxxxTM system is based on the integration of ROI's leading technologies: 1) frequency domain fluorescence lifetime-resolved imaging spectroscopy using time gated \"phase-locked\" detection, 2) steady-state fluorescence miniature spectrometer, and 3) remote fiber optic laser induced UV fluorescence detection. The RUVxxxxxxTM technology addresses the problem of developing a compact, energy efficient, fast detection, and highly sensitive UV xxxxxx to remotely detect and measure fluorescence signals from geophysical lunar materials such as minerals and organic species that exhibit characteristic fluorescence signatures in the UV-xxxxxx spectrum with relatively low fluorescence quantum efficiencies. The innovativeness of the miniature RUVxxxxxxTM system will support a large variety of xxxxxx terrestrial and space scientific discovery applications for chemical and biological materials identification and characterization as well as in the commercial market for medical and biological applications, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, environmental science, and defense and homeland security applications."	13294
Shock Hazard Prevention through Self-Healing Insulative Coating on SSA Metallic Bearings, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The space suit contains metallic bearings at the wrist, neck, and waist, which are exposed to the space environment. There is a need to maintain a high degree of insulation on the surface of the metallic bearings. Current methods to preserve the insulation feature include the use of anodized coatings and polyimide films. xxxxxxver, they are easily damaged and are hard to replace or repair. xxxxxxovations are needed to provide a protection method that is easy to maintain. xxxxxx with a developer and supplier of systems to xxxxxx, we propose to demonstrate the feasibility of a self-healing insulative polymer coating on the metallic parts that will allow the coating to repair damages under normal operational conditions of the spacesuit. The self-healing capability is afforded through a novel polymer morphology. In xxxxxx I, we will coat 17-4 PH stainless steel flat panels, test coating properties, and evaluate the self-healing performance under near ambient temperatures. In xxxxxx, the self-healing coating will be applied on a prototype metallic bearing and the coating composition and morphology will be optimized so that it meets all the functional performance requirements.  A functioning prototype metallic bearing will be delivered to xxxxxx. The goal is to achieve xxxxxx 6 by the end of the xxxxxx program.	13295
Rule-Based Analytic Asset Management for Space Exploration Systems (RAMSES), Phase II	2009-05-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxxs xxxxxx. (PSI) and the xxxxxx Institute of xxxxxx (MIT) were selected to jointly develop the xxxxxx-based Analytic Asset Management for xxxxxx Exploration xxxxxx (RAMSES) in this xxxxxx STTR project. This system implements a modular layered architecture that enables automated multi-level asset tracking and management for both space and ground applications based on state-of-the-art RFID technology. The main advantages of this system over current bar-code based asset tracking are: (i) significant time savings through automation, (ii) real-time remote status monitoring through the internet, and (iii) rule-based analytics for proactive asset management.In xxxxxx 2 we propose to redesign the Smart Container by taking advantage of xxxxxxration 2 RFID tag technology, lightweight RFID readers and batteries as well as integrating container technologies in a more tight and robust manner. We plan to build a total of three (3) smart containers to demonstrate scalability of the system and interaction among containers. The RAILS software will be upgraded to provide enterprise-level capabilities such as user authentication, inventory and item time history analysis, and an expanded analytic rule set. xxxxxx will be conducted both in the laboratory and in the field to demonstrate seamless three level tracking (container level, room level, outdoors). Finally, we will perform a detailed RAMSES cost/benefit analysis and market survey in preparation for xxxxxx 3.	13296
Integration of Notification with 3D Visualization of Rover Operations, Phase II	2013-06-01	2018-07-19	Future xxxxxx exploration missions will rely on remote operation of robots. As human explorers move further away from Earth, robotic precursors will scout destinations and robotic assistants will perform tasks to reduce astronaut risk and workload. 3D visualization is a key component of how humans will interact with robots for these missions. When the operator engages a robot using visualization, there is a risk that he or she will become too focused on what is happening now in the vicinity of the robot and will not be aware of other important events that are not apparent in the field of view. This risk only increases when operations involve multiple robots. It is essential to ensure that the user does not miss important events that do not manifest in the vicinity of the robot. xxxxxx, Carnegie Mellon xxxxxxersity (CMU), and xxxxxx Technologies (SGT) propose to develop software for notifying users of 3D visualization about important notices without distracting users unnecessarily or adding to the visual clutter around the robot avatar. This software will monitor events from the robot or user, identify which events should be brought to the user's attention, and alert users in the 3D pane. The appearance of alerts is altered to shift a user's attention to new notices based on an assessment of the importance and urgency of the notice specific to the user. Thus the same notice may be presented to different users in different ways. Because notices are anchored to a screen overlay, they are visible regardless of what location the user is viewing in the 3D space. In xxxxxx we will implement this software and evaluate its effectiveness for xxxxxx missions.	13297

Integrated Motion Planning and Autonomous Control Technology for Autonomous ISR, Phase I	2014-05-01	2018-07-19	SSCI and MIT propose to design, implement and test a comprehensive xxxxxxted Mission xxxxxxning \\& xxxxxx xxxxxx (IMPxxxxxx) for Autonomous ISR missions employing collaborating xxxxxx Aerial Vehicles (UAV). The main feature of the IMPxxxxxx system for Autonomous ISR is that it is based on robust real-time learning about dynamic and stochastic environments, and on a capability to autonomously react to contingencies while satisfying the mission objectives and the overall flight safety. The project will leverage a number of technologies recently developed by SSCI and  MIT, and integrate various system modules within a flexible and user-friendly framework. In order to achieve the project objectives, the following tasks will be carried out: (i) Problem Statement & Test xxxxxx Selection jointly with xxxxxx; (ii) xxxxxx, Implement & Test Vehicle-level xxxxxxsystems; (iii) xxxxxx, Implement & Test Mission-level xxxxxxsystems; and (iii) xxxxxx out  xxxxxxtion & Initial xxxxxx of the overall IMPxxxxxx xxxxxx for an Autonomous ISR mission. xxxxxx of the project will be focused on the enhancements and full implementation of the IMPxxxxxx system, prototype system development, and demonstration of its features through hardware-in-the-loop simulations and flight tests at MIT.	13299
Silicon Carbide Printed Structures	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	The plan is to design a process that will allow precision fabrication of xxxxxx structures using a sterolithographty printer and an oven process to sinter the material to meet our space flight requirements, using similar techniques that I have used in the past working with a local vendor. &nbsp;In the past, we created a process that allowed us to fabricate complex (but un-machinable) precision alumina oxide parts that flew on space flight projects.&nbsp; The plan for this IRAD is to develop a similar process that works with xxxxxx. &nbsp;This technology can be used for many applications; one is as an optical support structure for the xxxxxx project.&nbsp; The xxxxxx&nbsp;project has already been testing different materials that would provide a structure with a very low (stable) CTE and have good thermal conductance to assure accurate measurements over the project specified time.&nbsp; Tests by the xxxxxx project have shown that xxxxxx would be an optimum material.&nbsp; xxxxxxver, working with xxxxxx (like Alumina Oxide) has shown that it is very difficult to fabricate parts. &nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to work with a local vendor to source a sinterable xxxxxx powder and resin formulation.&nbsp; This material will be (3D printed) laser photo-cured to produce a green structure that can be de-binded followed by a sintering process.&nbsp; Using sintering methods, we will iterate these processes to remove macro defects.&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of this proposal will be to build samples for visual inspection and to test CTE and strength.&nbsp; Test parts will be tested in our GSFC code 544 labs, and the CTE tests will be conducted by the xxxxxx project (already existing test setup).	13300
Multiscale GasKinetics/Particle (MGP) Simulation for Rocket Plume/Lunar Dust Interactions, Phase I	2010-01-01	2018-07-19	A xxxxxxscale GasKinetic/xxxxxx (MGP) computational method is proposed to simulate the plume-crater-interaction/dust-impingement(PCIDI) problem.  The MGP method consists of a multiscale gaskinetic (MG) method for gasdynamics of rocket plume-in-vacuum flowfield, an Overlay method for gas-particle interaction.  MG combines BGK Gaskinetics (BGK) and direct simulation xxxxxx (xxxxxx) methods with a domain decomposition technique to account for various scales of rarefied gasdynamics, covering continuum to free-molecular regimes. The dust particles are modeled by an additional distribution function in BGK, thus carried by the MG-generated flowfield through an overlay method. Dust properties are to be modeled using xxxxxx Element xxxxxx (DEM) simulation, which will lead to comprehensive continuum equations for crater formation. xxxxxx will extend the present MGP method to 3D, with more advanced dust particle properties and complex crater formulation.	13301

Fault-Tolerant Precision Formation Guidance for Interferometry, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	A methodology is to be developed that will allow the development and implementation of fault-tolerant control system for distributed collaborative spacecraft.  The objective is to ensure that the cluster of spacecraft continue to meet high precision performance objectives in the presence of system faults and uncertainty.  The proposed innovation is the development of a fault-tolerant control system for distributed spacecraft.  The development process begins with fault-tolerant control system architecture and then the analysis of its performance.   The essential elements of this proposed fault-tolerant control system architecture are:     The fault detection filters and parity equations that generate residuals (the difference between the actual measurement and the estimated value)  with      important geometrical properties that enhance fault detection and identification.     The residual processor that takes these corrupted residuals and announces a fault with a given probability of false and miss alarm in minimal time.     A fault reconstruction system that estimates the fault magnitude once the fault has been identified.     A distributed control system that reconfigures based on the particular fault and the fault magnitude.	13304
BeatMark Software to Reduce the Cost of X-Ray Mirror Fabrication by Optimization of Polishing and Metrology cycle, Phase II	2018-05-01	2018-07-19	For xxxxxx optics, polishing the mirrors is one of the most costly steps in the fabrication of the system.  BeatMark software will significantly decrease the cost of xxxxxx mirror production. BeatMark will allow for parametrization of surface metrology data, which will be used as feedback for polishing parameter optimization and metrology experiment planning. By providing the parametrized optical surface description, BeatMark will optimize the costly polishing-and metrology cycle and enable numerical simulation of the performance of new xxxxxx mirrors performed by xxxxxx. BeatMark will help fulfill the requirements for sophisticated and reliable information about the expected surface slope and height distributions of prospective xxxxxx optics before the optics are fabricated. As we demonstrated in xxxxxx I, an optical surface can be thought of as a stationary uniform stochastic process and modeled with optimal Invertible Time xxxxxxiant Filters (InTILF). It was further shown that the modeling of one-dimensional (1D) slope measurements allows highly confident fitting of the xxxxxx mirror metrology data with a limited number of parameters and a 10-15% reduction of required length of metrology profiles.  Theoretically, a reduction of 50% is possible.  In xxxxxx, we will conduct field tests to assess what reduction in metrology is practical and implementable. With the parameters of the InTILF model developed in xxxxxx I, the surface slope profile of optics with a new specification can be forecast reliably. BeatMark will also process 2-D metrology data and provide a polishing optimization method, based on analysis of the mirror quality response to the polishing parameters. Our xxxxxx I studies indicated that the optimal InTILF modeling describes the mirror surfaces with very few filter parameters and high spectral accuracy.	13305
Digital mMirror Device Flight Spectrometer	2017-07-01	2018-07-19	The TI xxxxxx spectrometer xxxxxx (BOM) and schematics are available with the purchase of the TI xxxxxx® NIRscan™ xxxxxx (EM). We propose to acquire a NIRScan EM and review the BOM and schematics for application to flight; including considering for relevant environments and reliability. The result would be the development of a plan to take the instrument to a flight design using a xxxxxx flight instrument development program (e.g., xxxxxx).This proposed task would evaluate the acquired NIRspec EM with a sensor that is sensitive to longer wavelengths. The Inxxxxxx detector in the COTS instrument will be replaced with a xxxxxx (MCT) sensor and the diffraction grating changed. Performance of the system will be evaluated through wavelength calibration and total throughput. All testing will be performed using existing hardware. The current optical system, which doesn’t retain the entrance slit image at the xxxxxx, will be redesigned such that the slit is imaged on the xxxxxx and then this image collimated and focused onto the sensor. In this configuration the instrument becomes a very flexible hyperspectral instrument, with programmable selection of spectra from a specified portion of an imaged location or from a specific range of wavelengths or spectral resolution.	13306
Development of Millimeter Imaging Technologies	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	One of the most important physical discoveries, and largest surprises, over the past decade has been the discovery of the mysterious, so-called dark energy. This dark energy is responsible for the rapid acceleration of the expansion of the universe, originally inferred through the observations of supernovae. Observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide a method of constraining the dark energy, in addition to providing a wealth of information about other important cosmological parameters. Specifically, in recent years, the development of highly-sensitive instrumentation on orbital and ground-based platforms, including WMAP, xxxxxx, and SPT, have allowed for unprecedented measurements and mapping of the CMB, yielding major advances in our understanding of the characteristics and shape of the universe, the nature of the baryonic matter, and the growth of large scale structure. In spite of these advances, however, many further mysteries remain locked within future characterization of the CMB, most notably including direct probes of dark matter and energy.To address these scientific initiatives, I will engage in high-resolution observations of the CMB, through the development and deployment of a novel, polarization-sensitive receiver for the Atacama Cosmology xxxxxx (xxxxxxpol). In its own right, xxxxxxpol will be a next-generation facility to upgrade current instrumentation on one of the highest altitude, permanent-structure, ground-based observatories in the world, xxxxxx. Specifically, it is this transition from xxxxxx to xxxxxxpol instrumentation development and science to allow for measurement of CMB polarization, directed by a multinational research collaboration, which is the critical focus of my graduate-level research in the group of xxxxxx, my academic faculty advisor at the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx (Penn).That the scope of this work will allow for long-term critical technology development on a ground-based platform is of particular importance to future xxxxxx-supported CMB polarization orbital missions. Much in the same way that the development of suborbital missions such as TOCO and xxxxxx led to the ultimate success of orbital missions such as WMAP and xxxxxx, respectively, the instrumentation development of xxxxxxpol will allow for field-tested, systems level technology development, and drive the ultimate scientific objectives of a future satellite CMB polarization mission. As a result, the reach of this program of research will reside within a critical framework of design, implementation, and characterization of xxxxxxpol instrumentation as it will support advances in the technical readiness levels of technologies that will fly on future orbital platforms fielded by xxxxxx. This phase of my research will be conducted in close partnership with personnel at the xxxxxx xxxxxx (GSFC) in xxxxxx, MD, under the direct advisement of GSFC astrophysicist, xxxxxx, who has a strong tradition of partnership with detector development for the xxxxxx collaboration. In particular, the cryogenic, detector, and interface electronics that I will develop on xxxxxxpol will support a myriad of near-term xxxxxx science technology directives. These science area programs include the xxxxxx xxxxxxment for xxxxxxics of the Cosmos Program supporting the Technologies for CMB Polarization Measurements and dark matter detection directives, as well as the xxxxxx xxxxxxment for the xxxxxx Program to strengthen research into mission enabling technologies, including high-sensitivity millimeter wavelength detectors, in this case transition edge sensitive (TES) detectors, and advanced normal incidence optics, with a particular focus on the fielding of dilution refrigerator cooled cryogenic optics with novel xxxxxxreflective coatings. This proposal documents the efforts to support these initiatives through the development of advanced millimeter imaging technologies.	13308
Innovation Center Smart Light for Enhancing Creativity	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	Recent literature has documented that exposure to different types of light affect circadian rhythms, problem solving ability and creativity. xxxxxx upon these findings, xxxxxx has been exploring different types of lighting for astronaut health well-being and function. In this project, a set of large floor &ldquo;smart-lamps&rdquo; will be designed and constructed so that illumination can be adjusted, depending upon the need. Unlike conventional lamps, these lamps will have color-changing xxxxxx Emitting Diodes (LEDs), and the colors will be controlled by input from a smartphone. These lights will be deployed and evaluated in the xxxxxx SSC xxxxxxovation Center. Additionally, an efficient diffuser will be used to eliminate the point source emissions of LED light sources and produce a pleasant diffuse illumination. A novel light controllable &ldquo;smart-lamp&rdquo; will have utility in a multitude of studies that look at the effects illumination has upon human productivity. The purpose of this project is to develop a spectrally adaptable floor-stand smart-lamp. Intelligently mixing different narrow band color light sources can produce a wide range of light quality which can affect human performance. This smart-lamp will be designed and constructed so that illumination can be adjusted, depending on the need. xxxxxx color xxxxxx Emitting Diodes (LEDs) will be used as the light source, and illumination and individual color brightness will be controlled by a micro-computing device that will have the capability to adjust light levels based upon the need. An efficient diffuser will be used to eliminate the point source emissions of the LED light sources, mix the individual colors and produce pleasant diffuse illumination.	13309

Advanced Manifolds for Improved Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Performance	2017-07-01	2018-07-19	In late 2013 xxxxxx GRC proposed an in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) experiment on the xxxxxx rover mission. This proposal was one of the two highest‐rated proposals, in part because of the unique design of the GRC Bi-Supported Cell (BSC) solid oxide electrolyzer (SOE) at the core of the ISRU oxygen production module. xxxxxxver, as the team performed pre-phase A work during the first half of 2014, we identified a need to modify the gas manifolds for the SOE stack to reduce stresses on the ceramic components. We began to discuss the potential to switch from a slip-cast manifold fabrication to 3D printing to reduce the number of parts, eliminate sharp corners, allow for more gradual transitions, and enable more efficient flow paths.  The production of oxygen from the carbon dioxide in the xxxxxx atmosphere to produce roughly 23 metric tons of ascent propellant is included in xxxxxx baseline xxxxxx human exploration architecture. The use of SOEs for extracting the oxygen is the leading technology candidate due to its system-level simplicity. xxxxxxver, ISRU technical leaders in the agency still have doubts about ever being able to develop large SOE stacks using the traditional construction. Therefore, they are continuing to consider a reverse-water-gas-shift system as a back-up technology option for the human exploration missions in spite of the SOE system being 85 percent lower mass, 65 percent less volume, and requiring 88 percent fewer components. The demonstration of a robust and efficient manifold will complete the proof-of-concept for the innovative BSC SOE stack design and provide compelling arguments to ISRU leaders to invest further in this GRC technology. The goal is to advance the xxxxxx of the GRC BSC SOE and fuel cell concept to realize performance, mass, and volume advantages of this innovative design for xxxxxx O2 production.	13313
High Speed Photodetector for Terahertz Applications, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	The ever increasing volume of the information to be transmitted and processed demands fast communication systems that can fulfill a throughput of 1 Tb/s or even 10 Tb/s. This requires more than 100 times improvement of performance over today?s fiber optic communication systems, and calls for the development of terahertz or femtosecond technologies. xxxxxxlied Quantum xxxxxxs proposes an innovative photodetector for ultrahigh speed or terahertz applications. The success of this program will lead to drastic improvement of device performance in response speed, gain, responsivity and detectivity. xxxxxx I of this program is to demonstrate the proof-of-concept, while xxxxxx will be built on the success of xxxxxx I and seek the commercialization of the technology.	13314
Advanced Epitaxial Lift-Off Quantum Dot Photovoltaic Devices, Phase I	2013-02-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop a high-efficiency, triple-junction, epitaxial lift-off (ELO) solar cell by incorporating quantum dots (QDs) within the current-limiting subcell. We intend to leverage existing QD epitaxy processes developed by the Rochester Institute of xxxxxx and combine this with xxxxxxLink's expertise in multi-junction cell growth and ELO technology.	13315
Development of New Dielectric NDE Techniques for Spaceflight Materials	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx spectrometry will be performed on select spacecraft materials (i.e. heat shield materials, structural materials and insulating foams) to examine their capacitance and permittivity under controlled humidity. Three types of samples will be tested for each selected material, a dry, defect free sample, samples with known defects and moisture levels, and samples of unknown condition as a test of validity. Tests will be conducted from three microhertz to three gigahertz at temperatures ranging from -160°C to 400°C in order to obtain a full dielectric profile. The complex dielectric spectra acquired will be analyzed using computational modeling in order to determine the fit parameters associated with that material. These dielectric spectra and computational models will be used as the basis for proposals for new capacitance three-dimensional permittivity mapping sensor systems for monitoring structural health, extending a material’s lifetime in high humidity environments (like those of xxxxxx) and in forming improved repair processes.	13316
MARS GLOBAL SURVEYOR RAW DATA SET - MOI V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	;This data set contains archival raw, partially processed, and ancillary/supporting radio science data acquired during the xxxxxx Orbit Insertion (MOI) phase of the xxxxxx xxxxxx Surveyor (MGS) mission. The radio observations were carried out using the MGS spacecraft and xxxxxxbased receiving stations of the xxxxxx xxxxxxp xxxxxx xxxxxx (DSN). The observations were designed to test the spacecraft radio system, the DSN ground system, and MGS operations procedures; to be used in generating high-resolution gravity field models of xxxxxx; and for estimating density and structure of the xxxxxx atmosphere. Of most interest are likely to be the Orbit xxxxxx File and Original xxxxxx Record files, in the ODF and ODR directories, respectively, which provided the raw input to gravity and atmospheric investigations. The MOI phase extended from xxxxxxember 1997 to xxxxxxh 1999. On orbits 203-266 and 343-571 (approximately April and xxxxxxe-xxxxxxember 1998, respectively) the spacecraft periapsis was especially low giving the highest per-orbit sensitivity to gravity anomalies during the entire mission. xxxxxx were organized in approximately chronological order and delivered on a set of 159 CD volumes at the rate of 2-3 CD's per week. Typical volume of a one-day ODF was 300-400 kB. Typical volume of an ODR was 5-10 MB, and there could be multiple ODR's per day depending on DSN schedules and observing geometry.	13317
Study of Magnetic Nozzle Effects on Plasma Plumes	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	As identified in the xxxxxx In-xxxxxx Propulsion xxxxxxs xxxxxx xxxxxx, an efficient, high specific impulse, in-space plasma propulsion rocket engine is a key enabling technology for furthering xxxxxx goals in exploring the solar system and is one of xxxxxx xxxxxx. To help develop this technology and enable xxxxxx to meet its goals, I propose to study basic plasma flow in a magnetic nozzle, which is a critical technology required to optimize plasma rocket performance. xxxxxxic nozzles are important components of plasma propulsion devices because they help direct plasma flow, convert energy into thrust, and ensure efficient plasma detachment from a spacecraft. Immediate applications of magnetic nozzles include the Variable xxxxxx xxxxxxoplasma xxxxxx (VASIMR), which will be tested on xxxxxx in about five years and is under consideration for enabling future xxxxxx missions, including human exploration of xxxxxx. My study of magnetic nozzle influence on plasma plume dynamics will consist of using the newly formulated xxxxxxo Gas Kinetic xxxxxx (MGKM), based on kinetic theory, with additional development for multiple-species and an experimental study at the xxxxxx A&M xxxxxxersity xxxxxx xxxxxxing and xxxxxx. Using computational models and experimental prototypes, I will study magnetic nozzle performance by varying magnetic field strength and shape, as well as plasma density, pressure, and temperature. These coordinated computational and experimental efforts will allow for a more complete examination of the complex interplay between fluid and electromagnetic forces that affect a plasma in a magnetic nozzle. This research will help improve our knowledge of basic physical processes and provide guidelines for optimal design. The significance of the proposed work is that it addresses xxxxxx need to develop a key technology required for efficient in-space transportation, one that will be absolutely essential for both human and robotic solar system exploration missions in the future.	13318

Advanced Ignition System for Hybrid Rockets for Sample Return Missions, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	To return a sample from the surface of xxxxxx or any of the larger moons in the solar system will require a propulsion system with a comparatively large delta-V capability due to the magnitude of the gravity well. Consequently, significant propellant mass will be required. While it is technically feasible to generate O2 and CO propellants by electrolysis of xxxxxx from the xxxxxx atmosphere, it will only work on bodies where there is significant xxxxxx in the atmosphere, and the mass of the required infrastructure (electrolyzer, batteries, solar panels) is significant. A recent study has shown that bringing the propellant from Earth is a mass-competitive option. In particular, a hybrid rocket with multi-start capability trades more favorably than either a xxxxxx electrolysis system or a bipropellant system where the propellants are generated on Earth. Using a high-performance hybrid propellant combination and being able to restart the hybrid rocket are the keys. In previous and ongoing work, xxxxxx has demonstrated that electrically heated open-cell silicon carbide foam can be used as an igniter for both monopropellant and bipropellant rocket engines. Due to its low mass and favorable electrical characteristics, the foam can be heated to 1300?C in just two seconds, which enables it to quickly ignite any propellant flowing through it. In this project, the technology will be applied to hybrid rocket engines to give them multi-start capability. A portion of the liquid oxidizer stream (typically oxygen or nitrogen tetroxide) will pass through the foam and be heated such that the high temperature gas leaving the foam will be sufficiently hot to cause spontaneous ignition on contact with the fuel (typically paraffin). Once the engine is ignited, power to the foam heater can be turned off. xxxxxx will design, test, and characterize electrically powered foam heaters and perform ignition testing with paraffin fuel grains.	13320
Plume Mitigation: Soil Erosion and Lunar Prospecting Sensor	2013-08-01	2018-07-19	A rocket exhaust with enough thrust for a lunar landing can propel rocks, sand, and dust, which can damage nearby assets such as&nbsp;a lunar outpost, a mining operation, or the historic sites of xxxxxx, Surveyor, or other missions. This is especially important because some of the xxxxxx competitors intend to visit an xxxxxx site.In order to develop strategies to mitigate the effects of ejecta, those effects must first be accurately predicted. We do not yet know how much soil is ejected during a lunar landing to within better than an order of magnitude, and this limits our accuracy in estimating how much damage ejecta will cause. The only way we can calibrate the erosion rate is to measure the optical density of the blowing dust clouds visible in the xxxxxx landing videos. xxxxxxver, because of uncertainties in the characteristics of the film used in the xxxxxx cameras 40 years ago, and because there is no calibration method available to remove camera uncertainties and background lighting effects, we can be no more accurate than an order of magnitude in our estimate of the erosion rate by that method. To improve our estimate, we must fly an instrument to the xxxxxx, one specially designed to measure the rate of soil erosion under the rocket exhaust. This project seeks to develop a sensor to measure blowing soil during a lunar landing and also provide a low-mass, low-cost, low-complexity alternative for detecting valuable mineral deposits. We plan to demonstrate feasibility of the simplest, lowest-mass method of measuring density of a cloud of lunar soil ejected by rocket exhaust and using new math techniques with a small baseline laser/camera system.&nbsp;The focus is on exploring the erosion process that occurs when the exhaust plume of a lunar rocket impacts the regolith.Also, predicting the behavior of the lunar soil that would be blasted from a lunar landing/launch site shall assist in better design and protection of any future lunar settlement from scouring of structures and equipment. xxxxxx is gathering experimental data to improve soil erosion models and understand how lunar particles enter the plume flow.	13321
Murine microenvironment metaprofiles associate with human cancer etiology and intrinsic subtypes	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	We developed a mouse model that captures radiation effects on host biology by transplanting unirradiated Trp53 null mammary tissue to sham or irradiated hosts. xxxxxx expression profiles of tumors that arose in irradiated mice are distinct from those that arose in naive hosts. Host irradiation induces a metaprofile consisting of gene modules representing stem cells cell motility macrophages and autophagy. Human orthologs of the host irradiation metaprofile discriminated between radiation-preceded and sporadic human thyroid cancers. An irradiated host centroid was strongly associated with estrogen receptor negative breast cancer. When applied to sporadic human breast cancers the irradiated host metaprofile strongly associated with basal-like and claudin-low breast cancer intrinsic subtypes. Comparing host irradiation in the context of TGFB levels showed that inflammation was robustly associated with claudin-low tumors. The association of the irradiated host metaprofiles with estrogen receptor negative status and claudin-low subtype suggests that host processes similar to those induced by radiation underlie sporadic cancers. Total xxxxxx was extracted from mammary tumors derived from transplantations of non-irradiated p53null mammary fragments into irradiated hosts. We analyized a total of 32 p53null tumors from irradiated wild type mice: 9 from sham-irradiated hosts and 23 from irradiated hosts. We also analyzed 24 tumors from irradiated TGFb1 heterozygote hosts: 6 from sham-irradiated hosts and 18 from irradiated hosts.	13322
Visualizing Meta-Information in Remotely Sensed Earth Science Data, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxly sensed xxxxxx datasets are characterized by their complexity and size, which results in difficulty in effectively disseminating this information to decision-makers.  Part of this complexity is due to meta-information, or, characteristics of information such as uncertainty, staleness, etc. that add to the decision-making burden.  xxxxxx regarding this meta-information, and methods for effectively portraying it, have the potential of relieving the decision-maker?s workload and encouraging more situationally aware decisions.  To support the decision-maker, we propose to develop visual representations of meta-information in remotely sensed geospatial data.  Three core components characterize the proposed approach.  First, we will perform a cognitive task analysis of a selected set of case studies to develop a principled categorization of the key types and sources of information and meta-information required by the decision-maker in existing xxxxxx display systems.  xxxxxxond, we will design and prototype a toolkit for augmenting incoming data with the identified meta-information types and for rapidly creating new meta-information visualization methods.  This toolkit will support integration of prototype visualization methods with existing xxxxxx display systems.  Third, we will develop an evaluation methodology, including metrics of the utility of each meta-information visualization technique.  We will demonstrate feasibility of our approach for xxxxxx development.	13323

VOYAGER 1 SAT LOW ENERGY CHARGED PARTICLE CALIB. BR 15MIN	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	THIS BROWSE DATA CONSISTS OF RExxxxxxLED DATA FROM THE LOW ENERGY CHARxxxxxx PARTICLE (LECP) EXPERIMENT ON VOYAGER 1 WHILE THE SPACECRAFT WAS IN THE VICINITY OF xxxxxxURN. THIS INSTRUMENT MEASURES THE INTENSITIES OF IN-SITU CHARxxxxxx PARTICLES (>26 KEV ELECTRONS AND >30 KEV IONS) WITH VARIOUS LEVELS OF DISCRIMIxxxxxxION BASED ON ENERGY, MASS SPECIES, AND ANGULAR ARRIVAL DIRECTION. A SUBSET OF ALMOST 100 LECP CHANNELS ARE INCLUDED WITH THIS DATA SET. THE LECP DATA ARE GLOBALLY CAxxxxxxTED TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE (SEE BELOW) AND THEY ARE TIME AVERAxxxxxx TO ABOUT 15 MINUTE TIME INTERVALS WITH THE EXxxxxxx BEGINNING AND ENDING TIMES FOR THOSE INTERVALS MATCHING THE LECP INSTRUMENTAL CYCLE PERIODS (THE ANGULAR SCANNING PERIODS). THE LECP INSTUMENT HAS A ROTATING HEAD FOR OBTAINING ANGULAR ANISOTROPY MEASUREMENTS OF THE xxxxxx ENERGY CHARxxxxxx PARTICLES THAT IT MEASURES. THE CYCLE TIME FOR THE ROTATION IF VARIABLE, BUT DURING ENCOUNTERS IT IS ALWAYS FASTER THAN 15 MINUTES. FOR THIS BROWSE DATA SET ONLY SCAN AVERAGE DATA IS GIVEN (NO ANGULAR INFORMATION). THE DATA IS IN THE FORM OF 'RATE' DATA WHICH HAS NOT BEEN CONVERTED TO THE USUAL PHYSICAL UNITS. THE REASON IS THAT SUCH A CONVERSION WOULD DEPEND ON UNCERTAIN DETERMIxxxxxxIONS SUCH AS THE MASS SPECIES OF THE PARTICLES AND THE LEVEL OF BACKGROUND. BOTH MASS SPECIES AND BACKGROUND ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED FROM CONTEXT DURING THE STUDY OF PARTICULAR REGIONS. TO CONVERT 'RATE' TO 'INTENSITY' FOR A PARTICULAR CHANNEL ONE PERFORMS THE FOLLOWING TASKS: 1) DECIDE ON THE LEVEL OF BACKGROUND CONTAMIxxxxxxION AND xxxxxx THAT OFF THE GIVEN RATE LEVEL. BACKGROUND IS TO BE DETERMINED FROM CONTEXT AND FROM MAKING USE OF SECTOR 8 RATES (SECTOR 8 HAS A 2 mm AL SHIELD COVERING IT). 2) xxxxxxIDE THE BACKGROUND CORRECTED RATE BY THE CHANNEL GEOMETRIC xxxxxxxxxxOR AND BY THE ENERGY BANxxxxxxS OF THE CHANNEL. THE GEOMETRIC xxxxxxxxxxOR IS FOUND IN ENTRY 'channel_geometric_ factor' AS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH CHANNEL 'channel_id'. TO DETERMINE THE ENERGY BANxxxxxxS, ONE MUST JUDGE THE MASS SPECIES OF THE OF THE DETECTED PARTICLES (FOR IONS BUT NOT FOR ELECTRONS). THE ENERGY BAND PASSES ARE GIVEN IN ENTRIES 'minimum_instrument_parameter' and 'maximum_instrument_ parameter' IN TABLE 'FPLECPENERGY', AND ARE GIVEN IN THE FORM 'ENERGY/NUCLEON'. FOR CHANNELS THAT BEGIN THEIR NAMES WITH THE DESIGxxxxxxIONS 'CH' THESE BANxxxxxxSES CAN BE USED ON MASS SPECIES THAT ARE xxxxxxED INTO THAT CHANNEL (SEE ENTRIES 'minimum_instrument_parameter' and 'maximum_instrument_ parameter' IN TABLE 'xxxxxx', WHICH GIVE THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM 'Z' VALUE xxxxxxED -- THESE ENTRIES ARE BLANK FOR ELECTRON CHANNELS). FOR OTHER CHANNELS THE GIVEN BANxxxxxxS REFERS ONLY TO THE LOWEST 'Z' VALUE xxxxxxED. THE BANxxxxxxSES FOR OTHER 'Z' VALUES ARE NOT ALL KNOWN, BUT SOME ARE GIVEN IN THE LITERATURE (E.G. KRIMIGIS ET AL., 1979). THE FINAL PRODUCT OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE THE PARTICLE INTENSITY WITH THE UNITS: COUNTS/(CM**2.STR.SEC.KEV). SOME CHANNELS ARE SUBJECT TO SERIOUS CONTAMIxxxxxxIONS, AND MANY OF THESE CONTAMIxxxxxxIONS CANNOT BE REMOVED EXCEPT WITH A REGION-BY-REGION ANALYSIS, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN DONE FOR THIS DATA. THUS, TO USE THIS DATA IT IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL THAT THE CONTAMIxxxxxxION TYPES ('contamination_id' , 'contamination_desc') AND THE LEVELS OF CONTAMIxxxxxxION ('data_quality_id' CORRESPONDING TO THE DEFINITIONS 'data_quality_desc') BE CAREFULLY EXAMINED FOR ALL REGIONS OF STUDY. A DEAD TIME CORRECTION PxxxxxxEDURE HAS BEEN APPLIED IN AN ATTEMPT TO CORRECT THE LINEAR EFFECTS OF DETECTOR OVExxxxxxIVE (PULSE-PILEUP). THIS PxxxxxxEDURE DOES NOT FIX SEVERELY OVExxxxxxIVEN DETECTORS. A PxxxxxxEDURE IS AVAILABLE FOR CORRECTING VOYAGER 2 LECP ELECTRON CONTAMIxxxxxxION OF LOW ENERGY ION CHANNELS, BUT ITS EFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN EVALUATED ONLY FOR THE URANUS DATA SET. THUS, CORRECTIONS HAVE BEEN APPLIED ONLY TO THE URANUS DATA SET.	13326
Three Color Particle Optical Extinction Monitor, Phase II	2017-11-01	2018-07-19	"We will design, build and test a multi-color (red, green, blue) particle optical extinction monitor suitable for use in either land or airborne applications. The monitor will also contain a fourth measurement cell to allow for real-time subtraction of interferences caused by gas phase interferents such as nitrogen dioxide. The instrument will fit into a rack-mountable box that less than 13\" high (7U). Its time response will be less than 2 seconds and its precision (1 sigma) better than 1 inverse megameter in 1 second. The accuracy of the measurements will be within 5% of the values obtained using measurements of polystyrene latex spheres.  It will provide user access through serial and/or USB port connections as well as over the Internet.  A working unit will be delivered to xxxxxx langley xxxxxx."	13327
A Modular Swarm Optimization Framework Enabling Multi-Vehicle Coordinated Path Planning, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	The advancement of xxxxxx Aerial xxxxxxs (UAS) with computing power and communications hardware has enabled an increased capability set for multi-vehicle collaborative operations. By cooperatively allocating unmanned resources, vehicle tasking, and planning the subsequent vehicle paths, the efficiency of UAS operations can be maximized. Heron xxxxxxs proposes the xxxxxx-Agent Cooperative Engagement (MACE) framework that enables collaborative resource allocation, task allocation, and path planning for unmanned systems operating in dynamic environments subject to diverse communication conditions. This xxxxxx work will focus on the path planning portion of MACE, as path planning is an integral part of collaborative efforts in nearly every real world application. The path planning architecture will define key modules to plan paths to a global objective, assess potential obstacles, and avoid collisions while maintaining progress towards the global objective. The framework will be constructed in a modular fashion to allow a plug-and-play capability for the resource/task allocation as well as the various components of the path planning pipeline, giving end users the flexibility to explore other methods for UAS collaboration. At the conclusion of xxxxxx, the MACE path planning capability will be demonstrated using Heron xxxxxxs' previously developed flexible UAS simulation suite and ISAAC software, promoting high fidelity hardware-in-the-loop simulation/stimulation testing with COTS hardware components.	13328
Technologies for Mixed-Initiative Plan Management for Human Space Flight	2019-01-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx future missions will push the bounds of human-space exploration and challenge the mission designers and engineers to create automated systems that will enable the joint human-automation teams to operate more autonomously as they move further from terrestrially based mission control and the time lag of communication becomes a challenge. For future missions, the crew will need planning systems to meet as many mission objectives as possible given the constraints of crew and vehicle safety, and within the resource limitations inherent to their equipage. These systems must support not only creation of plans, but also their monitoring and active management, including adapting plans or re-planning completely in off-nominal conditions. Our proposed research on work representation addresses three intertwined challenges: (1) a formal representation of the work encompassed in the plan; (2) the interface for a human planner to reason about; and (3) computational methods to create and optimize plans which can potentially scale from focused, near-term off-nominal disturbance response to more strategic planning of larger sets of activities and longer durations. In this proposal, we propose to address each of the three challenges in a multi-disciplinary, integrated research program that addresses the four research areas listed in the proposal.	13329
Design Concepts for Low Aspect Ratio High Pressure Turbines for High Bypass Ratio Turbofans, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	The proposal is to identify cycle improvements and verify structural feasibility of shrouding a low aspect ratio High Pressure Turbine(HPT) rotor designed to use ceramic blades. When the clearance-to-span ratio between the rotating blades and the stationary casing is the same as the clearance-to-span ratio between the rotating shroud and the stationary casing, stage efficiency improves. xxxxxxver, shrouding rotor blades increases centrifugal stresses, and metallic HPT rotor blades are typically unshrouded in order to maximize stage output. Ceramic xxxxxx) blades weigh much less than metallic blades. Shrouded CMC blades have lower centrifugal stresses than unshrouded metallic blades. The fuel burn reduction from an increase in stage efficiency due to shrouded HPT blades will be determined. The fuel burn reduction due to the higher temperature capability of CMC blades will also be determined. Cycle efficiency improvements from shrouding HPT rotor blades will increase for future engines. The HPT blade aspect ratio will decrease as engine Overall Pressure Ratio(OPR) increases. Future HPT blade aspect ratios may be less than half of current aspect ratios. While the absolute clearance may decrease in future engines, the relative clearance is likely to increase. Aerothermal analyses will determine the improvement in fuel burn from shrouding cooled HPT rotor blades. Structural analyses will determine stresses for unshrouded metallic and CMC rotor blades, and for shrouded CMC blades.	13330
NEAR MSI IMAGES FOR CRUISE2	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	NEAR EDR volume sets contain a single data set, from one instrument and one mission phase (defined in the phase table in /AAREADME.TXT).	13331
Flexible Ablative Aerogel TPS Materials for Planetary Aerocapture and Entry, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	Renewed interest in missions to explore other planets has created a need for higher performance thermal protection systems (TPS) capable of shielding spacecraft from the severe heating encountered during hypersonic flight through planetary atmospheres.  Additional advances in the robustness, reliability, and survivability of single and dual heating exposures are desired while maintaining mass and thickness requirements. The ability to decelerate high-mass entry vehicles relies on flexible or deployable aeroshells which offer an approach for achieving larger aeroshell surface areas than otherwise attainable.    A flexible TPS is required that is capable of surviving reasonably high heat flux and durable enough to survive the rigors of construction, handling, and deployment.  xxxxxx proposes to develop improved flexible ablative reinforced polymeric aerogels to meet this challenge.  During xxxxxx I we will optimize the preparation methods to reduce thermal conductivity and increase flexibility and conduct a complete study of the aerogels' properties and capabilities.  The technology readiness level will progress from 2 to 3 during xxxxxx.  Successful completion of a xxxxxx program will result in an optimized and scalable formulation for the aerogel component of flexible TPS and performance data which will be available for further commercialization efforts for the aerospace industry.	13332
Low-Cost and High-Performance Propulsion for Small Satellite Applications, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	While small satellites continue to show immense promise for high-capability and low-cost missions, they remain limited by post-deployment propulsion for a variety of activities like precision maneuvering, orbit change and controlled re-entry / recovery. Furthermore, any on-board propulsion system capable of providing sufficiently high delta-V is likely to impose constraints on handling, storage, operations and safety that may limit consideration as a secondary payload. xxxxxx proposes to overcome these limitations by developing a compact, light-weight and low-cost 3U cubesat propulsion system that uses non-toxic propellants to provide approximately 125m/sec of delta-V within a 1kg and 100mm x 100mm x 100mm mass and size budget.	13333
Microfluidic Multichannel Flow Cytometer, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	"The proposed innovation is a \"xxxxxxfluidic xxxxxxchannel xxxxxx.\"  Several novel concepts are integrated to produce the final design, which is compatible with on-orbit operation from the standpoint of gravity-independence, low mass, low power requirement and automated operation.  The unique design features of the xxxxxxfluidic xxxxxxchannel xxxxxx include compact optics based on diode technology for both illumination and measurement, tested channel branching schemes, no sheath fluid anywhere, bubble-free PDMS lithographic manufacture, and analysis based on quantum-dot technology.  A design is proposed that counts RBC, WBC and three specified WBC subsets. Techshot, xxxxxx. and scientists at xxxxxx xxxxxxersity will collaborate to test the components of this innovation by pursuing the following xxxxxx I objectives: (1) create a critical design requirements document for the xxxxxxfluidic xxxxxxchannel xxxxxx, (2) breadboard and test its three critical physical components (illumination, sensing optics and flow channels) and (3) critically test feasibility of each component  and produce a top-level drawing suitable for initiating xxxxxx R/R&D to produce an integrated prototype.  The final product will be robust for use in space flight and low-cost on Earth for eventual point-of-care blood analysis and global AIDS patient status monitoring."	13334
Water Recovery Project	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	The AES Water Recovery Project (WRP) is advancing environmental control and life support systems water recovery technologies to support human exploration beyond low earth orbit. For FY12-14, xxxxxx Project is focused on the following: Cascade Distillation xxxxxx (CDS):  development of new primary processor for water recovery Brine Water Recovery:  develop/test systems to recover water from urine brines GreenTreat:  evaluate effectiveness of low toxicity urine pretreatments xxxxxx: assess impacts of dormancy (unmanned time periods) on beyond LEO water systems Silver xxxxxxcide: investigate usage of silver biocide for potable water disinfection Water xxxxxx Architecture: establish the architecture for xxxxxx future Water Recovery xxxxxx This project merged into AES Life Support xxxxxxs Project in FY15.The development of reliable, energy-efficient, and low-mass spacecraft systems to provide environmental control and life support (ECLS) is critical to enable long duration human missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). The Human Exploration Framework xxxxxx (HEFT) identified high-reliability life support systems as a required technology for destinations beyond cis-lunar space. The AES Water Recovery Project (WRP), led by xxxxxx xxxxxx (JSC) and partnered with the xxxxxx xxxxxx (ARC), xxxxxx xxxxxx (GRC), and xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Center (MSFC) is advancing water recovery technologies within the framework established by HEFT and the AES program. Recycling of life support consumables is necessary to reduce resupply mass and provide for vehicle autonomy. xxxxxxhough an integrated life support system is made up of a variety of systems to sustain functions such as atmospheric revitalization, thermal control, and waste management, a major driver in the sizing of a life support system is the Water Recovery xxxxxx (WRS). As mission durations increase, recycling of water becomes critical. xxxxxxd water is inadequate, and wastewater sources must be recycled into potable water. The state-of-the-art (SOA) WRS used on board xxxxxx (xxxxxx) relies on a high rate of consumable use and has experienced issues with precipitation and biofouling that have required operational and design changes. Due to these issues the recovery rate of wastewater on xxxxxx (Condensate and xxxxxx) is currently limited to approximately 74%. The mission of xxxxxx project is to develop advanced water recovery systems in order to enable xxxxxx human exploration missions beyond LEO. The primary objective of the AES WRP is to develop water recovery technologies critical to near term missions beyond LEO. The secondary objective is to continue to advance mid-readiness level technologies to support future xxxxxx missions. They also lead to further closure of the WRS, approaching the goal of 98% closure established by the Human Health, Life Support, and xxxxxxion xxxxxxs road map (OCT TA06).	13335
In-Situ Real-Time Temperature Monitoring of Thermal Protection Systems, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	This program addresses the need for interfacial and in-depth temperature monitoring of thermal protection systems (TPS).  Novel, linear drive, eddy current methods are proposed that incorporate innovative sensor array constructs, physics-based models, and multivariate inverse methods to nondestructively assess temperatures for carbon-based TPS materials such as felts and PICA.  The sensors can be mounted behind the TPS material or embedded within the TPS with sensing fields that are projected through the material to the far surface interface.  Thermally induced changes in the electrical properties of the TPS material are then used to determine the temperatures.  In xxxxxx I, the focus is on establishing feasibility by demonstrating correlations between electrical properties measured by the eddy current sensors and the TPS temperature.  It will also investigate adaptation of the sensor materials to support sustained and transient operation at high temperatures compared to typical operating conditions for standard eddy current sensors.  xxxxxx's physics-based methods for diagnostics of layered media using MWM-Array technologies have been demonstrated in scanning configurations for coating characterization, corrosion detection and sizing with and without interference layers, and condition and thickness assessment of felt-based TPS materials.  These methods have also been extended to surface mounted sensing applications such as torque, fatigue, and heat treatment condition monitoring.  xxxxxx delivered the MWM-Array solution used by xxxxxx KSC on xxxxxx leading edge to detect damage of the reinforced carbon-carbon (xxxxxx) thermal protection tiles; thus after establishing the property correlations with temperature, xxxxxx is well-positioned to deliver a novel method for temperature monitoring of TPS materials and material condition monitoring at elevated temperatures.	13336
Computational Appliance for Rapid Prediction of Aircraft Trajectories, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	Next generation air traffic management systems will be based to a greater degree on predicted trajectories of aircraft.  Due to the iterative nature of future air traffic management computations, the success of these systems will depend strongly on the ability to rapidly generate trajectory predictions. This proposal advances the development of a computational appliance for rapid prediction of aircraft trajectories (CAxxxxxxT) that combines the capabilities of the xxxxxx-FACET software with the fast computing capabilities of the emerging field programmable gate array technology.  By integrating the FACET software components on commercial, off-the-shelf high-speed computing technology, the proposed research will demonstrate high trajectory prediction speeds at modest cost.xxxxxx I research will demonstrate the feasibility of developing the trajectory prediction appliance using off-the-shelf hardware. High-speed trajectory predictions will be demonstrated under realistic traffic scenarios. A complete version of the system will be developed and provided to xxxxxx during the xxxxxx work. The trajectory prediction appliance will commercialized during the xxxxxx work.	13337
Inexpensive Reliable Oil-Debris Optical Sensor for Rotorcraft Health Monitoring, Phase I	2011-08-01	2018-07-19	Rotorcrafts form a unique subset of air vehicles in that a rotorcraft'spropulsion system is used not only for propulsion, but it also serves asthe primary source of lift and maneuvering of the vehicle.  No other airvehicle relies on the propulsion system to provide these functionsthrough a transmission system employing a single critical load pathwithout duplication or redundancy.  Thus it is critically important tomonitor the drivetrain components in rotorcraft propulsion systems inorder to detect the onset of damage or abnormal conditions.  We proposeto develop an analyzer for rotorcraft health monitoring.  Our proposeddevice, an oil debris monitor that relies on optical means to monitorthe fluid content, will provide a means to monitor the gear and bearingwear that is common in rotating machinery.  This device will be based onfluid analyzers previously developed for industry.  Our sensor willprovide a means to detect the onset of failure using optical techniques.It will be more sensitive than electromagnetic sensors.  In addition itwill be able to detect all debris, metallic and non-metallic, includingthose generated by hybrid ceramic bearings, and will be able to do thiseven in the presence of air bubbles.  Unlike other optical sensors, ourdevice will be fabricated from a glass monolith and will, by its verynature, stay aligned forever, even when submitted to severe vibrationsand shocks.  Within the glass monolith our sensor will integrate theequivalent of two optical instruments, one optimized for largemillimeter-size debris and one for smaller micron-size debris.xxxxxx will be developed to merge the data provided by the twooptical channels and to present a simple cohesive health assessment.	13338
T Cell Activation in Microgravity Compared to 1g (Earth  s) Gravity	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	This study tested the hypothesis that transcription of immediate early genes is inhibited in T cells activated in microgravity (mg). Immunosuppression during spaceflight is a major barrier to safe long-term human space habitation and travel. The goals of these experiments were to prove that mg was the cause of impaired T cell activation during spaceflight as well as understand the mechanisms controlling early T cell activation. T cells from 4 human donors were stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA) and xxxxxxCD28 onboard xxxxxx (xxxxxx). An onboard centrifuge was used to generate a 1g simultaneous control to isolate the effects of mg from other variables of spaceflight. xxxxxx expression analysis after 1.5 hours of activation demonstrated that mg- and 1g-activated T cells had distinct patterns of global gene expression and identified 47 genes that were significantly differentially down-regulated in mg. Importantly several key immediate early genes were inhibited in mg. T cells were isolated from human volunteers. T cells from each donor were kept separate and loaded into individual chambers in separate cassettes for the following treatments: mg non-activated mg activated and 1g activated. Therefore samples represent biological triplicates. Experimental units were launched into space and placed into the KUBIK facility onboard xxxxxx. The 1g units were placed in the central centrifuge positions and centrifuged with an applied 1g force. The mg units were place in the static positions for continued mg exposure. After 30 minutes of pre-incubation mg non-activated units were fixed by addition of xxxxxx (QIAGEN Valencia CA) removed from the incubator and stored in 4 xc2 xb0C. The mg and 1g activated units were injected with final concentration 10mg/ml Con A and 4mg/ml xxxxxxCD28. These cassettes were replaced into KUBIK on either the centrifuge or static positions and activated for 1.5 hours. Activation was stopped with the addition of xxxxxx and the units were then moved to 4 xc2 xb0C storage. All units were returned to Earth for analysis.	13339

Integrated Low Temperature CO2 and H2O Electrolysis	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxting the packaging of both the electrolysis of water and electrolysis of carbon dioxide into a compact dual electrolyzer package would be a highly useful and versatile product. Both of these electrolyzers could be started and run independently of each other, operate at mild temperature conditions, and quickly and repeatedly started and stopped. Because of the mild operating conditions, these electrolyzers should be capable of operating the thousands of hours needed for either a xxxxxx or xxxxxx mission. The production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and oxygen from water and carbon dioxide will be essential to astronauts for the exploration of the moon and particularly xxxxxx. xxxxxx and carbon monoxide can be used as fuels, as reducing agents to extract oxygen regolith metal oxides, and as precursors to the production of methane, other alkanes, methanol, and other alcohols.  The goal is to design, build, and test a dual water and carbon dioxide electrolyzers that are packaged together in a single compact, lightweight integrated package.	13341

Active Vibration Isolation System for Mobile Launch Platform Ground Support Equipment, Phase I	2009-02-01	2018-07-19	Balcones Technologies, proposes to adapt actively controlled suspension technology developed for high performance off-road vehicles to address xxxxxx requirement for xxxxxx xxxxxx Control for xxxxxx Support Equipment (GSE).  This innovative approach to meeting xxxxxx needs exploits approximately $23M of highly successful R&D since 1993 at the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx Center for xxxxxxmechanics (CEM) on active suspension systems for off-road military vehicles.  STTR subtopic T6.02 indicates that previous experience on xxxxxx Mobile Launch xxxxxx (MLP) shows that passive vibration isolation systems are inadequate and that actively controlled vibration isolation systems to supplement or replace existing passive systems will most likely be required.  Initial modeling of this system by CEM indicates that our team's proposed actively controlled xxxxxx Isolation xxxxxx (VIS) provides more than an order of magnitude improvement in vibration isolation compared to conventional approaches (see proposal Part 4 for details).  Our actively controlled VIS offers unique benefits compared to conventional passive systems because it mimics compliant attachment to inertial reference systems rather than attachment to local reference systems on the vibrating MLP; eliminates resonant peaks associated with passive systems (i.e., our system has flat response at low frequencies); and provides 10 to 16 times better vibration isolation over most of the frequency range of interest than conventional systems.  xxxxxx on our vehicular active suspension results and preliminary modeling described in proposal Part 4, our proven design approach will yield robust solutions that are not sensitive to variations in GSE electronics racks or MLP excitations during shuttle launch.  This approach fully meets all requirements defined or implied in STTR 2007-1 xxxxxx T6.02.	13343
Physics-Based Conceptual Design Tools, Phase II	2017-05-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxes for weight prediction, in the conceptual design phase, typically consist of parametric relations or empirical databases.  xxxxxxal databases work reasonably well when applied to existing or conventional designs, however, they fail to predict accurately the weights and loads associated with unconventional designs (like the Low Boom xxxxxx Demonstrator).  There exists a need to augment existing historical databases with a physics-based methodology/capability for predicting the weights and loads of unconventional designs. In the current proposal, M4 xxxxxxing will continue to streamline the structural layout process, improve the overall user experience, and develop a comprehensive suite of capabilities in an effort to build a complete weight statement for unconventional (and conventional) conceptual wing and fuselage designs.  The main goal for this effort will be to develop a software tool capable of generating weight and load responses for unconventional designs from physics-based structural analysis simulations.	13344

A Framework for telerobotics across the time delays of space	2012-01-01	2018-07-19	"The proposal will develop a novel intelligent time-delay mitigation framework to be used in bilateral space telerobotics. This framework will consist of master (human) and slave (remote site robot) controllers and adaptive predictors developed for operation in the presence of time delay. The end product will lead the way for an \"Avatar\"-like telepresence in space, providing reliable and stable tactile feedback to the human user.xxxxxxive Posicast Control (APC) is designed for systems with input time delays. In prior work by co-I xxxxxx and colleagues (Automatica, IEEE Transactions on Control xxxxxxs xxxxxx, Control xxxxxxing Practice) for automotive powertrain controls, APC delivered considerable performance improvements over the current standard non-adaptive, non-delay-compensating controllers. In this proposal APC will be implemented for the first time, as the controller for haptic (i.e., force) feedback regulation in a telerobotic system. This proposal will address the problem of time-delayed force reflection in the system, developed by PI xxxxxx and co-workers at xxxxxx xxxxxx. Communication delays, the principal destabilizing factor in teleoperation, will be mitigated by the APC's time-delay compensation capability. xxxxxx such as actuator degradation, parameter changes due to temperature variation and component aging will be handled by the APC's ability to adapt to parametric uncertainties. The power of this intelligent time delay compensation framework will be demonstrated on a simplified bilateral experimental teleoperation testbed, where a virtual slave manipulator will be developed in simulation and a force reflecting joystick will be used as the master. Unlike earlier system identification methods such as extended xxxxxx Filter approaches, this approach does not need a rich input (persistent excitation) for parameter convergence and unlike passivity based approaches, this approach has explicit time delay compensation which has the potential to provide better performance."	13346
Development of a Single-Frequency Narrow Linewidth 1.5mm Semiconductor Laser Suitable for Spaceflight Operation, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Many space applications rely on the utilization of xxxxxx xxxxxxion and Raging (LIDAR) techniques.  A key component of any LIDAR system is the laser source. Single frequency lasers in the 1.5-2.0mm region of the spectrum, with less than 10kHz linewidth, are needed and space qualification of the laser source is the critical requirement for the intended xxxxxx LIDAR applications. A novel, single-frequency, low noise planar semiconductor external cavity laser has been developed by Redfern xxxxxxted xxxxxxics xxxxxx. (RIO).  Cavity is based by the hybrid integration of an InP gain chip and a planar lightwave circuit (PLC) with waveguide xxxxxx grating.  The laser performance is characterized by a single-frequency output in the 1550 nm spectral region with a linewidth <3kHz; low phase/frequency noise, low RIN.  Additional testing, analysis, and qualification are necessary for its proper applicability and reliable use in space missions.  We propose to carry out a study of the suitability of PLANEX for space service, and to determine its potential susceptibility to space and radiation effects.  At the end of xxxxxx I, a set of target operational specifications, functional requirements, and associated space qualification protocol will be developed for further xxxxxx-Qualified External Cavity xxxxxx (SQECL) based on the PLANEX technology.Work plan included analysis of prior information and definition of target specifications, assessment of space environment effects, like radiation and vacuum, determination of current and target xxxxxx, plan and roadmap for xxxxxx, development of the approach for the re-design and complete space qualification at xxxxxx 2.	13347

Our innovation is to combine newly available UV lightemitting diodes (LEDs) with miniaturized, low power, high sensitivitysignal detection electronics to create a next generation, UAV-class,photometer for O3.   The advent of UV LEDs enables the development of avery compact and highly sensitive monitor for ambient O3.

Flexible Automation for Final Assembly of Blanket Arrays, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	In Topic Z1.01, xxxxxx seeks advanced photovoltaic technologies that can deliver cost, reliability, mass, volume and efficiency gains over current solutions.  Future photovoltaic systems range in size from xxxxxx-class to xxxxxx sized arrays.  Operational domains range from low Earth orbit to interplanetary distances.  xxxxxx levels may reach 100's of kilowatts operating at several hundred volts.  Specific power of greater than 130 w/kg, and stowed volumes 4 times denser than the current state of the art are required.  These functional parameters drive the need for large flexible blanket arrays comprised of solar cell modules assembled in myriad configurations.  Manufacturers of flexible solar arrays currently use manual processes to accomplish final assembly.  xxxxxx cost and reliability goals require new approaches to manufacturing.  xxxxxxing on recent successes in flexible substrate photovoltaics, our proposed effort creates a preliminary design for an automated final assembly manufacturing cell for flexible blanket solar arrays.  xxxxxx, scalable, and flexible, the proposed system incorporates the latest in machine vision, material handling, laser welding, and automated test capabilities.

One-Meter Class Drilling for Planetary Exploration, Phase II	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Robotic planetary exploration missions will need to perform in-situ analysis of rock and/or regolith samples or returning samples back to earth. Obtaining and delivering a sample can be a complex engineering problem, especially if it's done autonomously thousands of miles away. To accommodate future missions, these subsurface access and sample handling technologies must be developed to meet a broad range of potential requirements, including a variety of rock or subsurface materials, rigorous sample preservation requirements, and the general problem of autonomous operation in the presence of dust and with limited resources. The one-to-three meter range has been identified as a critical regime for planetary exploration and while there has been some technology development in this regime, there is currently no proven flight-like approach to robotically achieving this depth through layers of challenging material from realistic roving or landed platforms. The xxxxxx research has resulted in proving the benefits of rotary-percussive drilling system as it pertains to breaking of formation and cuttings transport. The primary objective of the proposed effort is to develop, via testing in a simulated xxxxxx environment, a breadboard one-meter sampling drilling system for acquiring a small volume of drilled cuttings and a core (if necessary) from a target depth on xxxxxx. This project would build on the existing knowledge base of xxxxxx drilling, and its particular strength lies with its capability of performing drilling tests under simulated xxxxxx conditions of temperature and pressure and xxxxxx atmosphere.This is a component technology effort that includes the development of a rotary percussive drill head and a sampling lead drill string. xxxxxx will leverage drill head development by utilizing voice coil percussive actuator technology developed by xxxxxx (JPL) for xxxxxx Powder xxxxxx.	13352

The proposed rotational configuration will allow the acquisition of multiple projections or images 360° around the region of interest, probing a conical volume of the object to be interrogated. The subsequent application of a computer model on these multiple projections, developed during xxxxxx I, will allow a three-dimensional reconstruction of the object under study.In the proposed x-ray imaging system, the primary technical advance will be to extend methods that normally supplied a 2D projected image through a sheet of material, to a 3D image with more complicated features at different depths, such as cracks, corrosion, voids, delaminations, land mines, or improvised explosive devices.  Also, the proposed system will be potentially portable, allowing it to be brought to the object to be imaged.The Beta and Production xxxxxx of the proposed system would incorporate a battery self-contained package and wireless data transfer capabilities. These systems would revolutionize the current imaging applications that rely on 2D x-ray imaging systems only.	13353

Exploration of Bio-Inspired Acoustic Metasurface-Based Absorbers	2017-07-01	2018-07-19	Regulators around the world, including xxxxxx Federal Aviation Administration, have adopted aircraft noise standards identified by the International Civil Aviation Organizations (ICAO) Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP), driving aircraft manufacturers to produce quieter aircraft.  Noise is a particular problem in aircraft, where the move toward lighter structures in both fixed and rotary wing aircraft has resulted in an increase in structural vibration and interior noise, as well as noise that can propagate to the ground and adversely affect communities surrounding airports. While vibration in the structure can be a concern at a wide range of frequencies, a relatively small amount of noise in the range 512-2048 HZ is critical to intelligibility of human speech.  In order to increase the ability of those in an aircraft cabin to understand each other, methods of decreasing the noise in the cabin must be found, particularly in the range below 1000 Hz, where current acoustic liners do not perform well. Preliminary work found in the literature has indicated that it is possible to achieve complete acoustic absorption at a low frequency (125 Hz) with a thin resonant absorber.  The proposed work seeks to develop thin, bio-­‐inspired resonant acoustic absorbers with outstanding performance through developing a suite of design rules necessary to apply this technology over a broad range of frequencies. This work will investigate 3D printable curved structures because of the potential for reflections at the square corners of the design reported in the literature.  Inspiration for the design to be investigated is taken from the xxxxxx, a marine mollusk with a shell that is a natural example of a logarithmic spiral.  The ability to selectively and effectively remove low frequency sound with structures designed for maximum effectiveness at the frequencies causing the most concern will allow a thin structure to exhibit substantially improved absorption of sound compared to conventional bulk absorbers. The goal is to develop thin, bio‐inspired resonant acoustic absorbers with outstanding performance through developing a suite of design rules necessary to apply this technology over a broad range of frequencies.	13359

The separator will be used for making high energy density rechargeable battery. This proposal responds to Topic Number F3.09, ?xxxxxx Technologies for Human xxxxxx?.The significance of the innovations is that with the use of the novel separator membrane, the resulting rechargeable lithium-ion battery will:1) have a selectable thermal shut-down temperature to meet the requirements for any particular application. Therefore, the battery will have an improved safety and reliability,2) offer higher energy density, 3) have longer cycle life, lower as well as stable impedance during charge-discharge cycling and 4) offer low cost since the separator could eliminate the use of such safety device as PTC and circuitry for lithium-ion battery.The innovation in the separator will be to develop a separator system which has a selectable thermal shut-down temperature.

For high precision attitude determination system, one of the identified needs is to provide milli-arcsecond class pointing for large space telescopes.  xxxxxxical xxxxxxics Company (OPC) has developed a novel interferometric star tracker than can provide milli-arcsecond class accuracy for future xxxxxx space missions.  The interferometric is similar to a standard star tracker, but with the addition of the interferometer subassembly in front of the imaging lens. This subassembly converts incoming starlight into a set of quadrature signals with sinusoidal dependence on the starlight incident angle.  These quadrature signals are used to determine star position, rather than the centroiding used in standard start trackers which enables the high accuracy.  OPC has designed and is presently manufacturing a compact (0.35U), lightweight (0.35 kg) and low power (<4W) interferometric star tracker for the Air Force.	13361

For the xxxxxx application, in order to maintain the energy or power system work property, onboard cooling systems has been installed, which in turn increase the mass and space. Therefore, it is important to develop improved capacitors in energy density, speed, efficiency to minimize the size and mass of future powr system.

Classification of Aeronautics System Health and Safety Documents	2012-02-03	2018-07-19	Most complex aerospace systems have many text reports on safety, maintenance, and associated issues. The Aviation Safety xxxxxxing xxxxxx (ASRS) spans several decades and contains over 700 000 reports. The Aviation Safety Action xxxxxx (ASAP) contains over 12 000 reports from various airlines. Problem categorizations have been developed for both ASRS and ASAP to enable identification of system problems. xxxxxxver, repository volume and complexity make human analysis difficult. xxxxxx experts are needed, and they often disagree on classifications. Even the same person has classified the same document differently at different times due to evolving experiences. Consistent classification is necessary to support tracking trends in problem categories over time. A decision support system that performs consistent document classification quickly and over large repositories would be useful. We discuss the results of two algorithms we have developed to classify ASRS and ASAP documents. The first is xxxxxx---a support vector machine (SVM) with simulated annealing, which is used to optimize hyperparameters for the model. The second method is classification built on top of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), which attempts to find a model that represents document features that add up in various combinations to form documents. We tested both methods on ASRS and ASAP documents with the latter categorized two different ways. We illustrate the potential of NMF to provide document features that are interpretable and indicative of topics. We also briefly discuss the tool that we have incorporated xxxxxx into in order to allow human experts to provide feedback on the document categorizations.	13368

Silver Ion Biocide Delivery System for Water Disinfection, Phase II	2016-04-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx space exploration missions have long considered returning to the xxxxxx and exploration of xxxxxx that challenge life support systems. For these long duration missions, xxxxxx is interested in replacing the iodine water treatment system with ionic silver. xxxxxxhough iodine treated water has been used successfully with xxxxxx, its use requires that the iodine be removed before being consumed by astronauts due to its adverse effects on the thyroid. For long duration exploration missions, minimal mass systems are desired that lessen logistical supply requirements for storing and distributing potable water. In particular, it is imperative that an effective biocide is used that prevents microbial growth, biofilm formation, and microbially induced corrosion in the water storage and distribution systems. To address these needs, Reactive xxxxxxovations, LLC successfully demonstrated a xxxxxx I program that developed an electrochemical silver ion generator to produce an effective biocide solution for disinfecting water throughout the water storage and distribution system.

GIOTTO ION MASS SPECTROMETER HIGH INTENSITY DATA V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	A wide range of ion species and velocity distributions are expected to be found as the xxxxxx spacecraft traverses the coma of xxxxxx's Comet. The outer coma is characterized by the interaction between solar wind and cometary plasmas, the inner coma by the outflow of cometary neutrals and their ionization products. The resultant demands on instrument dynamic range preclude use of a single sensor for measurements of ion composition. The xxxxxx Ion xxxxxx xxxxxx (IMS) therefore consists of two sensors: one optimized for the outer and the other for the inner coma, with each obtaining complementary information in the region for which it is not optimized.

Special high-temperature FBG sensors were also developedand tested to 1000C with an applied 7 kpsi tensile stress, and with anapplied 18 kpsi after cooling to room temperature.  A pure thermalloading calibration of these sensors in this temperature range wasperformed. The response of the FBG sensors was much faster than that ofthermocouples, and all electrical wires were replaced with a singleoptical fiber. In xxxxxx 2, IFOS will embed 1000 C-capable optical fibersensors into a TPS material. Following an appropriate instrumentationdevelopment, we will demonstrate temperature profile measurements with adepth resolution of 250-m or better. We will also distinguish betweentemperature- and strain-induced responses in the FBG sensors, a criticalconsideration for embedded sensor arrays.

Integrated Submillimeter-Wave InP HBT Electronics for Atmospheric Radiometry	2020-08-01	2018-07-19	The goal of this research is to improve the accuracy, sensitivity, and stability of a 325 GHz submillimeter-wave radiometer for ice cloud imaging. The study of clouds and precipitation systems advance our understanding of the atmosphere and global climate change. This study seeks to demonstrate components that improve on the performance of commercially available components, develop components that do not exist, and demonstrate the ability to integrate multiple components in a compact package. Recent advancements in semiconductor fabrication have enabled improvements of active and passive components in the submillimeter-wave range. Indium phosphide heterojunction bipolar transistors are a promising technology in the development of terahertz frequency active components for submillimeter-wave radiometry.We will use the 130-nm indium phosphide (InP) double heterojunction bipolar transistor (DHBT) process developed by Teledyne xxxxxxentific. xxxxxx monolithic integrated circuits (TMICs) can be realized with this process, which enable the design of a compact receiver on a single chip. Over the course of this experience, I will primarily focus on the validation of individual components using the InP DHBT process for future integration. The emphasis will be on the development of the front-end calibration module, terahertz bandpass filter, and RF LNA. The presence of the LNA in the front-end significantly reduces the overall noise figure of the system. Without this stage, the noise figure is primarily dominated by the mixer noise figure and conversion loss, which is currently the limiting factor in submillimeter-wave receiver sensitivity. The front-end filter stage eliminates double sideband ambiguity, which currently limits the channelization of scientific frequency bands of interest. A fast switching internally integrated calibration module will simplify system design, reduce cost, and increase calibration frequency by reducing the need for complicated cold sky calibration pointing maneuvers or costly thermal systems. The component performance will be tested with a 325 GHz heterodyne receiver prototype. Components will then be systematically integrated on a single chip to demonstrate their interconnect performance. The end goal is to produce a fully integrated TMIC that encompasses the front end RF components, LO chain components, and mixer. Individual components developed in this research can also be used to improve the performance of existing xxxxxx missions.	13374
Piezo-Hydraulic Hybrid Pump for Flight Control, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	Axis xxxxxxing Technologies proposes a revolutionary new technology that can provide performance levels, in terms of output power, bandwidth and mass, previously unmet in current commercially available actuation platforms.  The approach features a new hybrid pump, which is powered by active material stacks, and produces fluidic power to directly power hydraulic actuators. The compact, sealed unit eliminates external hydraulic components, such as accumulators, reservoirs, and, especially, long hydraulic tubing runs. By increasing system efficiency, reducing system mass and exploiting the unique characteristics of active materials, we expect to get a significant performance improvement in representative applications.  This is in contrast with many commercially available actuation systems, composed of either traditional hydraulic or electromechanical mechanisms.  Each of these systems is limited due to either excessive mass or limited bandwidth, or both.  And yet these technologies have been adopted across a wide spectrum of applications, including xxxxxx Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), high performance fighter aircraft, active automotive suspension systems and mobile robotic systems.  Each of these applications would benefit greatly from the introduction of an actuation system that can provide mass-savings and bandwidth improvements, simultaneously.	13375
A 3D Printer Enabled, High Performing, Microgravity Compatible, and Versatile Sample Preparation Platform, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	AI xxxxxxsciences proposes to demonstrate the ability of a microgravity-compatible, compact, light-weight, and automated versatile sample preparation platform (VSPP) that processes samples from various sample matrices (swab, potable water, blood, urine, etc.) to yield high quality nucleic acids for downstream molecular detection and identification in a closed-cartridge system.  Its primary function will enable xxxxxx to rapidly identify microorganisms that could affect crew safety.  This near-term deployable cartridge and platform system also has the option to perform isothermal and PCR amplification of nucleic acids.  This highly flexible system will allow previously complicated, labor-intensive, and time consuming processes to be carried out by a turn-key and closed system using pre-filled cartridges.  We have demonstrated on the ground in a laboratory setting that the entire setup for high quality DNA/xxxxxx extraction from urine, whole blood, serum, and saliva can be achieved via simple and reversible retrofitting of a low-cost fused deposition modeling (FDM) based 3D printers ranging from $199 to $750.  The VSPP can also be used to capture and purify cell and protein targets.  The ability of having a dual-use 3D printer in-flight to carry out sample preparation and additive manufacturing in-flight can be an attractive option in long duration space flights.	13376

Ocean Life Detection on Alien Worlds, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	This proposal is in response to xxxxxx request for technologies that can enhance the detection of life in alien oceans. As stated in the call, the Technologies for xxxxxxion of Extant Life subtopic seeks instruments and component technologies that will enable unambiguous determination of whether extant life is present in target environments on other solar system bodies. Because there is no single measurable signature of life, this will require advances in a variety of areas, from those involving sample processing to the detailed components of chemical and optical instruments. Searches for extant life can take place in a variety of environments, including ocean depths, ice sheets, dry deserts, seasonal flows, or even dense atmospheres; technologies are required for handling samples obtained from any or all of these environments. Preprocessing technologies required for those samples may include separation, concentration, dilution, drying, staining, mixing, and many other common processes for laboratory analysis, but which must be done in a remote, autonomous environment. Tests of whether a given sample contains or indicates the presence of extant life include the full range of microbiological and chemical techniques, but those that do not require the addition of potential biomarkers (e.g., complex organics) as part of the test are preferred. We have spent he past 5 years developing a novel means of capturing and concentrating organic molecules onto specialized graphene surfaces, available for later detailed analysis. The adaptation of this technology could offer a new avenue for the detection of key organic elements in ocean environments that contain many background elemental noise sources.	13378

Resin Infusion Rigidized Inflatable Concept Development and Demonstration	2013-06-01	2018-07-19	A novel concept utilizing resin infusion to rigidize inflatable structures was developed at JSC ES.  This ICA project intends to complete manufacturing of a prototype inflatable structure with a dry fiber pre-form between two membranes that will be evacuated and filled with catalyzed epoxy resin to cure and form a rigid composite wall structure. The concept was proposed in 2011 and prototype design completed with co-op support. Two aluminum end caps appropriate for multiple prototype tests were produced by ES7 and the EC soft good lab completed the prototype using existing methods and materials. A design study was completed to improve manufacturability, reduce mass, and illustrate the possibilities of utilizing this technique for on-orbit applications.Utilizing resin infusion to rigidize an inflatable structure and form fiber-reinforced composites on-orbit is a novel concept that builds on current xxxxxx technology in expandable structures.  The current effort to design and build a prototype has sucessfully demonstrated a proof of concept that the technology is viable using current state-of-the art materials and manufacturing techniques.  A cylinder shaped object with round end caps was manufactured as a simple article, but domed shapes are possible and expected to be the most efficient although more complex to design and build.  A braided carbon fiber fabric material of two ply thickness was utilized in the prototype to provide a thin and optimally reinforced structure.  The fabric was contained on two sides with laminated sheet polymer to form a vacuum bag attached at both end caps. xxxxxx ports and resin fill ports were located at opposite ends and routed to the fabric cavity between the two polymer sheets.  The cavity was evacuated and filled with resin that cured to form a rigid composite structure cylinder.  It is planned to perform a pressure test of the cylinder and produce a preliminary design of a larger dome-ended structure for proposed future work. A conceptual design for the mechanical system required to provide the internal pressure, vacuum resin trap, and resin mixing and filling will also be presented.	13382

Development of a Suit Glove with Capacitive Touch Screen Capability	2013-06-01	2018-07-19	Portable digital devices such as the iPad provide lightweight, powerful, and convenient methods of communication, and there are countless potential applications for use of these personal devices in spaceflight environments.  xxxxxxver, many of these devices utilize capacitive touchscreens that do not work well with existing suit architecture, limiting their potential use by crew when suited and gloved in intra-vehicular activity (IVA) scenarios, such as during launch, ascent, entry, and docking scenarios.  xxxxxxver, there are commercially available gloves for driving and recreation that incorporate capacitive capability to allow their use with capacitive touchscreens.  Our goal with this ICA is to create a basic launch/entry/ascent suit glove prototype (based on an ACES or similar suit glove) that is functional with portable touch-screen devices such as the iPad, leveraging the concepts included in the commercial off the shelf (COTS) glove hardware.  Our prototype glove will then be run through a simple user test to evaluate its functionality and usability.	13384
ROSETTA-ORBITER CHECK GIADA 2 EAR1 EARTHSWINGBY1 V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	This volume contains Experiment xxxxxx acquired by xxxxxx during 'Earth swing-by 1' phase. More in detail it refers to the data provided during the following in-flight tests: 'Passive xxxxxx xxxxxx n. 0' (PC0) held on 28/29-03-2005. It also contains documentation which describes the xxxxxx experiment. The data reported in this data set have been converted from ADC counts to engineering values. The quality of the Housekeeping and xxxxxx data is good. xxxxxxentific data are due to noise, as no grain event is expected during this mission phase. These data must be only considered to evaluate xxxxxx behaviour and not as real scientific data. xxxxxx reported by GDS and IS are due to noise as no dust event is expected during this mission phase. MBS frequency changes, once normalised for frequency vs. temperature dependence, if present, are due to deposition of contaminants existing in the S/C environment. Housekeeping and xxxxxx data from all xxxxxx sub-systems are useful to evaluate instrument health and behaviour when compared with similar data acquired during other mission phases.	13385

Compact, Lightweight, High Voltage Propellant Isolators, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	TA&T, xxxxxx. proposes an enabling fabrication process for high voltage isolators required in high power solar electric and nuclear electric propulsion (SEP and NEP, respectively).  State-of-the-art propellant voltage isolators have sufficient performance for existing ion and xxxxxx thruster engines with voltages of a few kilovolts.  xxxxxxver, future high thrust, high specific impulse (xxxxxx) engines will have to support beam voltages >10kV to meet performance requirements.  If existing isolator designs are simply scaled-up for higher voltages, then a significant mass penalty is incurred.  The proposed fabrication approach, known as ceramic stereolithography(CSL), is an automated, layered manufacturing process that enables net shape, monolithic ceramics with complex geometry.  The process is beneficial as a rapid, low cost fabrication approach that enables exploration of novel isolator designs with complex internal flow passages.  The process is also beneficial for isolator production, because it is capable of making the complex structures as a single piece ceramic, eliminating the liability associated with multi-piece construction necessary using conventional ceramic fabrication methods.  The xxxxxx I project will involve process development, device design, prototype fabrication and testing in collaboration with xxxxxx Corporation (Redmond, WA).	13387
Passive Capillary Pumped Cryocooling System for Zero-Boil-Off Cryogen Storage Tanks, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	"Significant cost and weight savings of a space mission can be achieved by improving the cryogenic storage technology.  Added cryogen mass due to the cryogen boil-off, the oversized tanks and storage systems make the planetary missions prohibitive.  The recently proposed Zero-Boil-Off (ZBO) strategy for cryogen tanks, which combines both thermal insulation and \"cryocooling\" technologies to manage the heat leaks.  It is a straightforward concept that could lead to a significant weight/cost reduction for long-duration missions.  xxxxxxver, several issues must be resolved before the ZBO benefits can be realized.  One of which is the management of the through-the-tank-wall \"heat leaks\".  Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) is a passive two-phase heat transport device that utilizes solely capillary action to circulate the working fluid in a closed loop to transfer heat from one location to another.  LHPs do not contain mechanical moving parts and therefore are highly reliable and durable for space applications.  A novel cryogenic LHP system is proposed for the ZBO cryocooling.  It is capable of acquiring heat from a large area of the cryo-tank wall, transporting it to a cryocooler for heat rejection, and meeting other design requirements of cryogen storage systems for space missions."	13388

The mirror/filter combination will block 95% of the incident solar radiation, while allowing a narrow pass-band for laser communication.	13389
Day and Night Energy Harvesting	2012-09-01	2018-07-19	Earth is a continuous source of blackbody IR radiation, peaking at a wavelength of 10µm.Over 24 hours there is energy in this emission comparable to visible solar radiation, but traditional photovoltaics are unable to harvest this wavelength range.This  innovative technology, plasmonic nano-antennas, will be capable of harvesting IR radiation and producing DC electrical output.A MIM(metal-insulator-metal) diode structure is used to rectify electrons emitted from optically-energized nanoparticles Traditional photovoltaics are limited in two major ways: by the availability of light and the wavelengths that can be absorbed. xxxxxxtime, seasons, and latitude limit the amount of radiation to absorb, and the available bandgap of materials for photovoltaic cells limits absorption to “shortwave” radiation (near-IR wavelengths and shorter).  xxxxxxver, the Earth absorbs incident sunlight and re-emits the energy as “longwave” blackbody radiation, peaking in the 10 μm wavelength range, known as “earthglow” (as opposed to “earthshine”, the visible light directly reflected by the Earth). Earthglow continues during nighttime, varying only about 25% during a 24-hour period. It is difficult to harvest with traditional photovoltaics, but not  alternative radiant energy harvesting methods. An approach employing plasmonically-active nano-antennas offers a potential solution due to the tuneability of the resonant wavelength via antenna geometry.  The ultimate goal of this project is to produce nano-antennas able to rectify infrared optical energy (terahertz frequencies), such as earthglow, into DC electrical current. The concept of nano-antennas has been around for many years, but due to fabrication difficulties, researchers have only recently begun to actually demonstrate them in the lab. Theoretically, single-junction photovoltaics have a light-to-electricity conversion efficiency limit of around 30%. xxxxxx-antennas have a theoretical capture efficiency (incident light absorbed) of up to 95%, with lab demonstrations reaching 80%. The challenge facing researchers is converting this potential abundance of captured light efficiently into electricity, but nano-antennas promise a greater upper limit to energy production than present technology. Work on the energy harvesting project places xxxxxx on the cutting edge of nano-antenna development. The design begins with an insulating substrate that is covered by a bottom electrode of metal film.	13390

Bifurcation Tools for Flight Dynamics Analysis and Control System Design, Phase II	2007-03-01	2018-07-19	The purpose of the project is the development of a computational package for bifurcation analysis and advanced flight control of aircraft. The development of relevant analytical and simulation-based technologies for the prediction and control for fail-safe adaptivity under adverse and upset conditions is an important step in advancing flight safety goals. Impaired aircraft operate much closer to bifurcation points than a fully functional vehicle. Thus, it is necessary to be able to evaluate aircraft and flight control system performance near stability boundaries. Understanding behavior near operational limits and developing control and recovery strategies for these circumstances is fundamental to achieving that goal. To that end TSi proposes an integrated set of computing tools involving symbolic, numerical and visualization environments. In phase I, the architecture was validated using a benchmark problem. xxxxxx proposes the extension of the results from xxxxxx I into a commercial package to be made available to the analyst/designer of fault tolerant control algorithms.	13392
Ka-Band Electronically Steered CubeSat Antenna, Phase II	2019-03-01	2018-07-19	Kymeta Government xxxxxxutions (KGS) designed, analyzed, built, tested, and delivered a small, lightweight, low-cost, low-power electronically steered xxxxxx prototype antenna subsystem module (ASM) intended for use on 3U or larger xxxxxx. This antenna uses a tunable dielectric material and an array of radiating elements to create an interference pattern that steers the beam in the desired direction. This method provides moderate gain without the use of mechanical steering and similar functional performance to a traditional phased array at a fraction of the size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C).The Ka band ASM is specifically designed to be a flexible component in the communications chain. All of the interfaces to the ASM are simple, non-proprietary interfaces, and the KGS ASM is agnostic to radio, waveform, and network selections. A receiver can be readily integrated with the ASM to enable closed loop tracking, and the simple command interface of the ASM provides the communication system with the ability to easily and rapidly refine the beam position to maximize gain and ultimately improve link margins and data throughput without incurring additional power draw or mechanical stability effects.xxxxxxfications to the aperture to better integrate, survive launch, and operate in space were designed during xxxxxx I; during xxxxxx, KGS plans to update the control electronics and software that drive the antenna and then build and perform RF test on the overall system to verify compliance with requirements. To date, a low-SWAP xxxxxx steerable antenna for small satellites has not been successfully demonstrated in space. At the conclusion of this xxxxxx contract, the KGS ASM will be ready to go to space qualification testing and then a demonstration launch, where KGS will have the opportunity to prove the ASM's capability in the target environment.	13393
Programmable Relaxor Open-Loop Mirrors Using Imaging Spatial Encoder (PROMISE), Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	Future advanced telescopes require active mirror compensation withoutthe complexity of real-time adaptive control. Current wavefrontcorrectors, while dimensionally stable, require closed loop controlusing a wavefront sensor and complicated electronics to maintain mirrorshape. For space based systems, simplified open loop control isdesirable since it reduces power and weight while greatly improvingsystem reliability by reducing complexity and electronic parts count.xxxxxx proposes a Programmable Relaxor Open-Loop Mirror usingxxxxxxted Spatial Encoders (PROMISE) that combines surface parallelactuation and micro optical encoders. The programmable relaxor open-loopmirror uses a surface parallel actuator array, made using ferroelectricmicromachining originally developed for silicon based MEMxxxxxxprogrammable actuator array enables the dimensionally stability andangstrom level control provided only by relaxor ferroelectrics, as hasbeen demonstrated by xxxxxx.

Dust Abrasion Damage on Martian Solar Arrays	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	As much as it is different, xxxxxx is similar to Earth in the fact that erosion due to dust abrasion occurs on both planets. Studies, both analytical and experimental, have been done in the past to quantify this erosion and its effect on xxxxxx surface systems. There are currently investigations for new concepts for a solar based power system for future human crewed missions on the surface of xxxxxx. These arrays would have to be orders of magnitude larger than any used previously on the surface and would need to be well understood in terms of performance and reliability. This project aims to provide more insight into the durability of such systems by experimentally abrading solar array components under expected mission conditions. We’ve observed dust accumulation on solar array surfaces on the xxxxxx rovers and have seen its removal by dust devils and high winds. We have also seen the amount of dust in the atmosphere on regular days and during dust storms which will obscure much of the light that reaches the solar arrays. These factors are relatively well modelled and can be applied to the large arrays being considered for future human crewed xxxxxx missions. xxxxxxver, the new lightweight flexible materials that will make up these arrays which have not yet been proven in dusty, high wind conditions.  The goal is to experimentally determine the effect of high speed xxxxxx dust hitting solar cell and array components.	13395

One of the key barriers it faces to the widespread use of VL vehicles within xxxxxx is the cost of maintenance on the vehicles to keep them safe and reliable. Qualtech xxxxxxs, xxxxxxQSI) in collaboration with xxxxxx - Mission xxxxxxs and Training (LM-MST) seeks to address these maintenance challenges by fielding a predictive Condition xxxxxx xxxxxx Plus (CBM+) solution leveraging a diagnostic reasoner TEAMS-RDS (Testability xxxxxxing And xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx) and prognostic algorithms. CBM+ involves inferring, tracking and forecasting of system degradation based on state awareness acquired from monitored data through fault detection, isolation, identification, diagnosis and prognosis techniques and to proactively plan maintenance actions to improve system availability and safety. QSI-LM's CBM+ solution will furnish the ability to keep the vehicle health status continually ahead of an advancing failure accumulation through a predictive maintenance strategy geared towards replacement-while-in-operation before the ensuing failures render the VL vehicle inoperable. xxxxxx will focus on current health state identification through detection, isolation, root cause analysis and identification of faults that have already occurred, while prognosis will leverage the current health state identification and forecast performance degradation, incipient component failures and probability density (or moments) of remaining useful life (RUL) or Time to xxxxxx (TTM) or Time to Failure (TTF). It is anticipated that the CBM+ solution will leverage the currently existing communication capabilities between the aircraft, the pilot and ground-support personnel in a seamless and automated manner.	13401
Hydrogenation of Very Long Wavelength Infrared Focal Plane Arrays Based on Type II Superlattices, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	We propose to advance the Ga-free InAs/xxxxxx type II superlattice (T2SL) materials technology for very long wavelength infrared (Vxxxxxx) focal plane arrays (FPAs) by passivating lifetime-limiting defects with hydrogen from inductively coupled plasma (ICP) H2-plasmas. In xxxxxx, 1k x 1k detector arrays will be fabricated and hybridized to matching read-out integrated circuits for implementation in future Earth and xxxxxx science infrared imaging instruments and become part of future space missions. xxxxxx format FPAs (2k x 2k) will be realized as part of follow-up developments extending beyond xxxxxx. In xxxxxx I, we will compute and optimize the electronic band structures, optical properties, xxxxxx coefficients and ideal diffusion-limited dark currents of InAs/xxxxxx T2SL absorber materials. The operating temperatures and overall thickness will be used as part of a trade-off study designed to achieve the quantum efficiency and dark current program goals. xxxxxxley-Read-xxxxxx minority carrier lifetimes of T2SLs are predicted to increase due to hydrogen-passivation, leading to larger signal-to-noise ratios for improved range of detection, enhanced discrimination capabilities, or operation at higher temperatures. Reducing the electrical activity of defects by passivating them with hydrogen is equivalent to lowering their density, and has proven successful in other semiconductor systems. The proposed hydrogenation technique makes use of the same dry-etch equipment employed during FPA manufacturing, making it easy to implement. In addition to the potential to remove the deleterious effects of bulk material defects, ICP hydrogenation also improves the detector's surface passivation quality. Smaller pixels, reduced integration times, and systems with larger fields-of-view will be realized, allowing the imaging of fast changing scenes over long ranges.	13402

Intelligent Temporal Data Driven World Actuation in Ambient Environments Case Study: Anomaly Recognition and Assistance Provision in Smart Home	2013-04-23	2018-07-19	Abstract — A possible resident of smart home is an old person or an Alzheimer patient that should be assisted continuously for the rest of his life; however, normally this person desires to live independently at home. Typically, this person may forget sometimes completion of the activities; may realize the activities of daily living incorrectly, and may enter to dangerous states. In this context smart home project is proposed as an ambient intelligent environment, in which on one hand the resident is observed continuously through the embedded sensors, and on the other hand the resident is assisted automatically through the embedded electronically controllable actuators. In this work, we propose an approach to interpret the sensors’ observations and how to automatically reason in the required assistance. The result is provision of automated assistance for the smart home resident.	13406
Algorithms and Techniques for Environmental Sensing and Spacecraft Monitoring	2020-08-01	2018-07-19	To achieve xxxxxx fundamental goals of continuing to explore and expand human and robotic presence to xxxxxx and beyond (xxxxxx Strategic xxxxxx, xxxxxx), spacecraft must be able to identify hazards in their external environment and to monitor and respond to maintain their own system health, safety, and performance. The space environment both within our own magnetosphere and at interplanetary distances within our solar system has known hostile regions (such as xxxxxx and the Jovian radiation environment) as well as unknown environments and the risk of significant disturbances from our xxxxxx. For deep space exploration far from Earth, mission durations are longer and require more robust spacecraft systems that are risk-aware, have greater reliability, and can gracefully adapt to compensate for or respond to spacecraft aging and performance degradation. As spacecraft venture beyond distances where real-time  command and control through communications systems is feasible, spacecraft must be able to inform on-board decision-making with little or no ground interaction. That capacity will require spacecraft not only to understand their external environments, but also to have software that can internally monitor the system and make decisions based on status.The primary deliverable will be a suite of algorithms used characterize the external environment and to detect atypical behavior in spacecraft telemetry, collecting the raw results across the spacecraft system and reporting the weighted results to on-board decision-making routines. By evaluating previous mission data compared to known space environment conditions (space weather events), I will determine the telemetry response to the external space environment. The telemetry response findings will be a deliverable of this proposal as well. Using the known telemetry responses, I will develop algorithms that will be able to characterize the external environment by matching on-board responses to the telemetry response findings corresponding to different space weather events. In addition, I will deliver technology that will detect and diagnose atypical performance and hiccups in their system or individual components on-board. In contrast to current spacecraft as a sensor  methods (e.g. neural networks), the proposed algorithms do not make assumptions about the underlying distributions and does not impose any component- or satellite-specific parameters or thresholds. This approach is consistent with a general approach known as change-point detection  and allows the algorithms to be used for the entire satellite system without operator input. By combining findings from the telemetry feeds using sensor fusion data association techniques (e.g. K-means), the spacecraft will be made more aware of it's own internal and external state, yielding a state estimation  current health and performance state of the spacecraft system and the current state of the environment  at any one time, allowing for autonomous and intelligent on-board decision-making.The findings through data analysis of previous mission data allow for more risk-aware algorithms for future missions. For example, xxxxxx xxxxxx mission does not carry any space environment detectors. xxxxxxver, if information can be gathered from the xxxxxx telemetry, valuable knowledge about the Jovian environment can be used for the xxxxxx mission and other future Jovian missions. The proposed algorithms allow for longer mission durations by providing greater reliability to external environment hazards and adaptability to evolving missions. The proposed algorithms directly support xxxxxx in xxxxxx Strategic xxxxxx to expand our human and robotic presence to xxxxxx and beyond. The exploration leads to spacecraft encountering unknown and hazardous environments that the spacecraft will need to react to. Therefore, in addition, the proposed algorithms enable greater sustainability and risk reduction when integrated with FDIR systems.	13407
Airborne Power Supply Unit	2017-09-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx xxxxxx Supply xxxxxx (APSU) is a programmable DC/DC converter that can supply multiple constant voltage or constant current outputs in a small enclosure, enabling power conditioning from a single battery bus to multiple experiments with differing requirements.&nbsp; The technology behind the APSU allows xxxxxxorbital xxxxxxs and xxxxxx Services (SPARS) users requiring DC power distribution to minimize the number of battery packs and relays required for missions, thus reducing mass, volume, complexity, cost, and increasing flight safety and reliability.&nbsp; The primary beneficiary for this technology is the science customer as the APSU consolidates power distribution and generation to a single unit, alleviating the customer of this burden and allowing the Principal Investigator (PI) to focus on the science.The APSU concept is based on a buck regulator circuit first developed for use on the AETD Diminutive Assembly for xxxxxxellite deployables (DANY) experiment which required 3.3V constant voltage from a +28V battery source.&nbsp; Furthermore, the buck regulator circuit was also flown&nbsp; and provided the flexibility late during integration to regulate the +28V battery bus to +12V which prevented the strain gauge experiment from overheating.&nbsp; Finally, the buck regulator circuit was further refined and used on a xxxxxx xxxxxxflight Center&#39;s CubeSat on the Special Services Card (SSC) to provide constant current for deployment of the solar panels and magnetometer boom.The primary objective of this effort is to develop a solid-state circuit in a small footprint that will efficiently convert a raw battery voltage to an adjustable constant voltage or constant current output.&nbsp; Additionally, the APSU will integrate a microcontroller to adjust output set points, turn services on and off, and monitor power draw of active loads for fault detection and isolation.The APSU proposal addresses risk reduction in existing airborne power distribution systems commonly used on suborbital platforms.&nbsp; For example, Sounding xxxxxx PIs are currently responsible for providing their own experiment power conditioning.&nbsp; The APSU would enable consolidation of power distribution and generation to a single architecture&nbsp;with fault protection (i.e. overvoltage, overcurrent, etc.), allowing xxxxxx to provide experiment power conditioning as a standard service to the suborbital science community.In addition to the suborbital science community, the APSU core technology could be modified to meet CubeSat needs with appropriate parts selection for the mission environment, allowing it to be utilized by the SmallSat community to deploy solar panels via electric motors, actuate CubeSat deployables via burn wires, or provide power conditioning to multiple satellite experiments utilizing a common battery bus. &nbsp;&nbsp;The innovative elements of the work proposed are:&nbsp; high efficiency power conversion (switching versus linear), small form-factor, inherent fault protection, and robust solid state circuitry.	13408

Compact Ka-band Feed Design Validation and Shaped Reflector Design for ISS and Ka-band RF Comm Demonstration for future Earth Observing Missions	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	The objectives of this proposal include building an antenna feed for xxxxxx reflector antennas and to re-design an earth-shaped reflector antenna prototype for an orbit altitude of 424 km for a possible demonstration on xxxxxx (xxxxxx).  By the end of the first year, a compact wideband antenna feed operating at xxxxxx xxxxxx frequency allocation would be built and tested and the new reflector design will be accomplished.  This work brings an innovative solution by providing an Earth coverage antenna (ECA) for LEO missions operating at xxxxxx frequencies, which was previously an open question and something that has never been developed. An ECA will be the most appropriate solution for missions wanting to go to higher data rates than currently provided by X-band comm systems, but with ultra-stable platform requirements. For the xxxxxx specific application, the reflector will have to be slightly different than it would be for a ECA for an Earth observing satellite, however this effort will demonstrate xxxxxx capabilities in designing this type of antenna for space applications	13411
Subsurface Access, Characterization, Acquisition, Transport, Storage and Delivery in Microgravity, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	This project will develop geotechnical measurements, sample extraction and transport equipment for subsurface regolith on NEOs, asteroids, moons and planets, enabling accurate evaluation of subsurface composition and chemistry.  Non-contact measurements can provide preliminary information regarding bulk density and composition; however, more accurate assessment of a bodies' composition and evaluation of potential resources, their abundance and ease of recovery will require physical contact with the surface, and penetration or drilling down to depths that are not subjected to significant space weathering. Such surface-contact and sampling probes will enable physical and chemical characterization of unweathered subsurface material. Inertial and autonomous percussive penetration to depth, along with novel drilling and tailings-transfer approaches, will be developed to both attain the required depth, and to advance semi-autonomous sample-collection/recovery technology so as to minimize the need for operator (or tele-operator) involvement.  Both core- and bulk-regolith sampling methods which minimize loss of volatiles, will be developed. To the extent feasible in the laboratory, this project will approximate key features of reduced-gravity conditions both physically and in particle-scale numerical simulations to ensure that the methods developed will function in realistic environments. The primary aim of this study will be advancement of technologies suitable for use on robotic precursor characterization-missions, with the anticipation that further-improved versions of the same methods will minimize the time and effort of human intervention/involvement during follow-on exploration or prospecting missions. In addition, the feasibility of novel extraction, transport, handling, and storage methods for bulk regolith material, which minimize loss of volatiles, will be developed. Such developments will be especially useful for in-situ resource evaluation and utilization.	13412

Building Blocks for the Rapid Development of Parallel Simulations, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxentists need to be able to quickly develop and run parallel simulations without paying the high price of writing low-level message passing codes using compiled languages such as C/xxxxxx/xxxxxx.  This is especially true of students and researchers who are expert scientists in their field but don't have the time or resources to become experts in parallel computing.This proposal will enable scientists to rapidly create parallel simulations by providing parallel building blocks in the high-level programming language xxxxxx.  The building blocks themselves, such as distributed arrays, parallel linear algebra, parallel xxxxxx transforms and parallel statistical algorithms, will be implemented by leveraging existing high-performance libraries and creating high-level xxxxxx objects that completely hide the details of the underlying libraries and parallelism from users.

A New Class of Flare Prediction Algorithms: A Synthesis of Data, Pattern Recognition Algorithms, and First Principles Magnetohydrodynamics, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxearchers have been working on flare prediction for many decades. xxxxxxver, the best prediction result achieved by xxxxxx for major flares, CMEs, and solar proton events (SPEs) is a probability of detection of 39%, meaning that only 39% of the events are correctly predicted. Existing flare prediction algorithms are mainly based on a combination of data, statistical analysis, and pattern recognition algorithms. A serious deficiency of these algorithms is that they do not include the constraints and predictive power of the basic equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) that describe the dynamics of the plasma atmosphere. We propose a new approach to flare prediction based on combining a detailed data based description of the solar atmosphere with the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In this approach, a subset of the MHD equations take data as input, and then predict physical quantities that are not measured but may be important for predicting flares. Since the MHD equations must be obeyed by the plasma, when combined with data they also provide new constraints on pattern recognition algorithms that search for correlations between the occurrence of a flare and the values of observed and MHD model predicted quantities that describe the pre-flare plasma.	13419
Miniaturization of Airborne Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy Instrument, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx measurement technologies are required to support science campaigns to better quantify rapid changes in the Earth atmosphere system. A key factor in this heightened focus on risk and uncertainty is the growing recognition that the climate is changing far more rapidly than was thought just five years ago. xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxs and Harvard xxxxxxersity propose to miniaturize the Harvard xxxxxxted Cavity Output xxxxxxscopy (ICOS) instrument for use in the unique reel-down payload pod of the \"StratoCruiser\", a proposed propulsive high-altitude balloon gondola. Combining the persistence of balloon platforms, the vertical measurements of soundings, and the mobility of aircraft the StratoCruiser will enable new understanding of stratospheric phenomenon.  The focus of the proposed effort will be to enhance the StratoCruiser reel-down payload capability through size, weight, and/or power (SWaP) reduction in the dual laser, 50 cm cell, ICOS instrument. The soundings from the StratoCruiser ICOS-based observing system provide laboratory quality, in situ detection of radicals, isotopes, ozone, reactive intermediates, long-lived tracers and condensed and vapor phase xxxxxx and HDO over the US for a period of 4-6 weeks."	13420

High-Pressure Oxygen Concentrator, Phase II	2010-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx desires to generate and store gases including oxygen and nitrogen at sub-critical conditions as a part of its lunar and spacecraft atmospheric systems. xxxxxx at pressures up to 3000 psia is particularly desired for refilling storage tanks for lunar and in-flight applications including recharging high-pressure gas bottles for EVA/EMU, lunar rovers and surface hoppers. To address these needs, Reactive xxxxxxovations, LLC proposes to continue developing and delivering a compact high-pressure oxygen concentrator that can take low-pressure atmospheric gas and generate a separate stream of high-pressure pure oxygen. During a xxxxxx I program, we applied our high-pressure reactor hardware to separate and compress oxygen from ambient pressure air and oxygen streams in both dry and saturated conditions. We used this information to develop a predictive performance model for the oxygen concentrator to aid in a conceptual design and to allow xxxxxx mission planners to conduct trade studies on metrics including the generated oxygen rate per compressor mass and power requirements. For the xxxxxx program, we will produce operational prototype electrochemical concentrators that produce 3000 psia oxygen from ambient pressure sources of air or oxygen. These concentrators will be sized to produce 2 kg of oxygen at 3000 psia within a 24 hour time period. By the end of the xxxxxx effort, this concentrator will be at a xxxxxx Readiness xxxxxx of 4-5.	13423
Standardizing Research Methods for Prognostics	2013-05-13	2018-07-19	Prognostics and health management (PHM) is a maturing system engineering discipline. As with most maturing disciplines, PHM does not yet have a universally accepted research methodology. As a result, most component life estimation efforts are based on ad-hoc experimental methods that lack statistical rigor. In this paper, we provide a critical review of current research methods in PHM and contrast these methods with standard research approaches in a more established discipline (medicine). We summarize the developmental steps required for PHM to reach full maturity and to generate actionable results with true business impact.	13424

Furthermore, we will develop a provably correct translation from the Action xxxxxxuage into Logic Programs under the Answer Set Semantics.  Action xxxxxxuages have already proven useful for the representation of intelligent agent that can perform planning and diagnosis. Our proposed work would allow for more robust agents as well as the ability to do tasks such as scheduling.  We will also develop proof techniques to ensure correctness of the agents.

AstroCube: An Asteroid Prospecting CubeSat Mission, Phase I	2017-06-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx, in partnership with xxxxxx State xxxxxxersity (ASU), proposes to develop a robotic resource prospecting mission to a near-Earth asteroid using a 6U CubeSat, nicknamed \"AstroCube\".  This ambitious mission is enabled by xxxxxx's iodine-fueled BIT-3 RF ion propulsion system that can deliver ~1mN of thrust and ~2200sec of total xxxxxx with 65W nominal input power.  With 1.6kg of solid iodine propellant onboard, the BIT-3 thruster will provide AstroCube approximately 3.1km/s of delta-V maneuverability to rendezvous with the target, Asteroid 2001 GP2, during its next closest Earth approach in October 2020.  The 6U CubeSat platform is chosen due to its low cost and ease of access to ride-share opportunity on GEO-bound upper stages, as well as on the upcoming xxxxxx SLS demonstration missions.  The AstroCube mission will leverage a unique deep-space 6U CubeSat bus with ion propulsion, currently being co-developed by xxxxxx and Morehead State xxxxxxersity (MSU) under xxxxxx xxxxxx flight program.  The proposed mission will encompass several technology innovations, including compact science instruments and autonomous CONOPS, which are the focus of this xxxxxx I development.  A rad-tolerant, 1/4U sized camera-xxxxxx device will give AstroCube \"eyes\" to survey the asteroid and help with proximity navigation.  Due to the asteroid?s weak gravitational field, the spacecraft will be required to use real-time depth image processing and its ion thruster to navigate around the asteroid during final approach to a low stationary altitude.  Once such close proximity is reached, a 1U sized neutron spectrometer will be activated to characterize the abundance of hydrogen, which would indicate presence of water ice, by detecting slow-moving neutrons as they scatter off the asteroid's regolith from the bombardment of cosmic rays."	13429

Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Given the extended duration of future missions and the isolated, extreme and confined environments, there is the possibility that behavioral conditions and mental disorders (xxxxxx-IV-TR) will develop. The overarching goal of this project is to deliver an xxxxxx Behavioral Health xxxxxx Tool that unobtrusively integrates all available behavioral measures collected during a mission to provide a dashboard of behavioral health indicators.

Three Dimensional Volumetric Terahertz Scanning for Aerospace Non Destructive Evaluation, Phase I	2005-01-01	2018-07-19	In this xxxxxx I STTR project, we propose to develop the critical innovations necessary for a high speed three dimesnional terahertz (THz) tomographic imaging system for aerospace non destructive evaluation (NDE) applcations.  xxxxxx and the xxxxxx industry are beginning to utilize THz reflection imaging (for example, examining the space shuttle external tank sprayed on foam insulation for voids and disbonds).  THz NDE imaging is widely applicable to composite resin, ceramic, plastic, natural, and other non-metallic materials.  Current commercial equipment is capable of  two dimensional raster scanning.  The wider utility of THz NDE technology can be more fully exploited for the development of xxxxxx and aerospace applications if the full potential for high speed three dimensional THz imaging is realized.  The current state of the art equipment collects the THz waveform reflection from a very narrow depth range from a strongly reflective backing.  The proposed innovations will increase the dynamic range of the THz waveform acquisition to allow collection of reflections from weaker interfaces, and will increase the window of high speed scanning of the THz waveform to allow three dimensional images to be reconstructed for objects many inches thick.	13435
MGS MARS/MOONS MAG/ER MAPPING ER OMNIDIRECTIONAL FLUX V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx xxxxxx Record (Exxxxxx) is a time ordered series of electron measurements from the xxxxxx xxxxxx Surveyor (MGS) Mission. Each record consists of a time tag with 19 scalar data points representing measurements of the electron flux in 19 different energy channels, ranging from 10 eV to 20 keV, with an energy resolution of 25%. Each data point is a measure of the electron flux (cm-2 sec-1 ster-1 eV-1) averaged over a 360 x 14 degree disk-shaped field of view (FOV). During the xxxxxx xxxxxx, as the spacecraft orbits the planet the ER field of view sweeps out the entire sky (4-pi ster) every 58.5 minutes, which is much longer than the integration time per record (2 to 48 sec, depending on energy and telemetry rate) and much longer than most timescales of interest in xxxxxx' plasma environment.	13436
Development of Instrumentation for Direct Validation of Regional Carbon Flux Estimates	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	We are pursuing three tasks under internal research and development: 1) procure a state-of-the-art, commercial instrument for measuring atmospheric methane (xxxxxx) in situ and modify the analyzer intake flow, temperature, and pressure control systems to achieve sufficiently fast time-response for eddy-covariance flux determination from aircraft; 2) assess the advantages, disadvantages, limitations, and current status of potential greenhouse gas measurement approaches relevant to GSFC development and produce a white paper summary of findings; and 3) write a paper on measurement of GHGs using glint-reflected sunlight and submit it for publication in a refereed journal. xxxxxx distributions of GHG sources and sinks, principally xxxxxx and xxxxxx, and characterization of the processes that control them, comprise a key uncertainty in projection of future carbon-climate interactions and, hence, climate prediction (US xxxxxx Cycle xxxxxx xxxxxx, 2011; xxxxxx Strategic xxxxxx, 2011). Very little information is available to evaluate global source/sink inversions (e.g., from xxxxxx or the xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx (CMS)). Bottom up and top down estimates (including forest inventories) don&rsquo;t match well, even for relatively well-sampled areas like xxxxxx xxxxxx. Bottom-up vegetation flux models vary widely among themselves, and their response to climate forcing is apparently limited and not adequately tested. xxxxxx tower data are notoriously local site-specific with large spatial variability. Furthermore, requirements for CMS treaty-relevant monitoring, reporting, and validation or Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation are likely to be extremely stringent compared with current research-level uncertainties and very difficult to quantify on a regional scale. All of this points to an emerging need for xxxxxx to develop a capability for direct validation/evaluation of GHG surface fluxes, which can be most directly obtained regionally via airborne eddy covariance measurements. The principal objective of this project is to assemble an airborne system for direct (eddy covariance) greenhouse gas flux measurements to be used in evaluating top-down and bottom-up source/sink estimates including validation of products from xxxxxx and other space-based GHG missions, biogeophysical models, and application in airborne science campaigns. Here we plan to build and test the first component in this system, a fast-response xxxxxx analyzer, which is currently not generally available for use. &nbsp;We also have related objectives to summarize the characteristics of potential GHG space sensor approaches for xxxxxx and to publish a study of glint sampling for GHG spectra.	13437
3D Constitutive Relations for An Aligned Carbon Nanotube Polymer Nanocomposite as a Function of Morphology	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx polymeric materials are of significant interest for advanced aerospace structures due to their novel mechanical and transport (electrical, thermal, ionic, etc.) properties. The system we intend to study comprises an aligned carbon nanotube (A-CNT) forest embedded in an aerospace-grade unmodified thermoset epoxy resin, forming an aligned-fiber polymer nanocomposite, an A-CNT PNC. As previously demonstrated in our group, by controlling the composite's morphology its properties can be tailored to exhibit significant differences along different material axes (e.g., thermal and electrical transport along conductive CNT axes vs. transverse to them). The A-CNT polymer nanocomposite is of interest in order to develop nano-engineered hierarchical materials comprised of aligned-CNTs in polymer matrices acting in concert with micron-dia. advanced fibers (such as carbon fibers, in a \"nanostitch\" architecture). Mastery of the use of such material will allow for the engineering of highly specialized aerospace structures with precisely specified properties and desirable properties (e.g. strength-to-weight ratio) far in advance of those presently available for use in aerospace systems. The ability to produce structures with anisotropic material characteristics will also lead to significant weight savings for use in load-bearing components, which are of course vital in any aerospace applications.A novel mechanical densification process developed by our group allows volume fraction to be varied between 1 and 20+%. The work we propose will provide measurements of the linear elasticity tensor for this class of materials, providing a basis for further constitutive model development. The stiffness relation for the A-CNT PNCs as a function of CNT volume fraction will be assessed using standard configurations and optical strain mapping. Significant stiffness biases have previously noted along the different material directions associated with the CNTs, with relative stiffness increases exceeding 100%. Furthermore, strain ranges of linearity are identified and different behaviors are noted in compression vs. tension. Prior work in this epoxy system has shown no discernible effects of the CNTs in the cross-link density or other characteristics (Tg etc.) of the polymer matrix. These findings will allow interpretation of the measured response of the A-CNT PNCs via a number of different avenues, including a computational microstructural investigation of structure-property relations focusing on the morphology of the fiber reinforcements (the CNTs). A finite element model (FEM) will be implemented that captures the effect of CNT 'waviness' (non-collimation) on the resulting homogenized composite properties. Future work to be pursued in the upcoming academic year include expanding this testing technique to explore visco-elasticity effects and large-strain behavior, and modeling work to focus on CNT-CNT interactions. The goal of the research is to use this new data to allow an improved characterization of A-CNT PNCs in order to support their use in actual aerospace applications in the near-term."	13438
Plenoptic Attitude Monitoring System, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx is seeking an optical system capable of analyzing the attitude of wind tunnel models in real time, with a high angular resolution and robustness. To address this need, xxxxxxical xxxxxxics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Plenoptic Attitude xxxxxx (PAM) system, which utilizes a dual plenoptic imager to extract attitude information. The innovative dual plenoptic design utilizes one plenoptic imager to analyze and correct for turbulence effects introduced by airflow around the model, while the second imager extracts the attitude information from the model itself. This system is capable of providing real-time measurements with a high angular resolution of better than 9 arcsec. As an analytical imaging based system, PAM may also be placed in any location that provides it with a view of the model under test, thereby ensuring compatibility with existing monitoring technologies and enabling protection from wind tunnel temperature and pressure conditions. The compactness of the design also minimizes setup and calibration time, thereby fully compatible and reducing the impact on wind tunnel operations. During xxxxxx I, POC will design and demonstrate the feasibility of the PAM system using a low-speed wind tunnel and modeling for higher wind speeds.

SmallSat Low Mass, Extreme Low Temperature Energy Storage	2016-04-01	2018-07-19	High specific energy, low-temperature power systems would allow space exploration missions to do more science over longer periods, farther from the sun. This proposal is for the first year of a two-year project to ultimately space test a new low-temperature capable, battery/ultra-capacitor power system. This innovation would reduce the mass of power systems, eliminate the need for wasteful battery heaters, and increase the amount of energy available at low-temperatures.

This new environmental resistant packaged (ERP) resonant gyroscope will have a small size, weight and power (SWAP) with a mass of around 6 grams and a volume of 3.1 cm3 (fully packaged and with drive electronics) at a cost of ~$500 per axis in volume production. This would be 1/200th of the size and 1/40th of the price of the current state of the art. In phase I, the feasibility of achieving a 0.001 degree xxxxxx temperature stability will be investigated using the oven control feature of the ERP. This level of temperature control will mitigate the sensor's long term drift (bias drift).

The design of the fuel cell power plant is based upon using hydrogen and ambient air that will operate over varying temperatures, humidity, and altitude to provide reliable power to the air vehicle. During the phase I program, we will demonstrate the feasibility of our power plant operating at a lower module wattage near 50 watts with an integrated fuel supply that will last for 12 hours.

Unlike mirrors and lenses, the holograms are thin and flat, can be fabricated on thin gossamer membranes and stretched over space frames covering thousands of square meters.HOMES (Holographic xxxxxxical xxxxxx for Exoplanet xxxxxxscopy) is a space telescope designed for exoplanet discovery. Its double dispersion architecture employs a holographic optical element as a primary objective in conjunction with a novel secondary spectral interferometer. Unlike mirrors and lenses, the holograms are thin and flat. They can be fabricated on thin gossamer membranes and stretched over space frames covering thousands of square meters. This provides the scale of collector needed to capture the photons from very faint sources like exoplanets and bring them to a focus. Because holographic optics focus by the process of dispersion, they are intrinsically spectrographic providing a wealth of detail about the composition of the images they form. Add to this a novel notch filter to dim the star that takes advantage of the spectrographic image, and HOMES is a concept that addresses the demanding specifications of a telescope to find habitable planets within 30 light years of earth.	13445

Architecture for Integrated System Health Management, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	Managing the health of vehicle, crew, and habitat systems is a primary function of flight controllers today.  We propose to develop an architecture for automating many of the response actions in problem situations and coordinating these actions with human response activities.  Our approach is to develop a basic module that automates (1) xxxxxxning what response actions to take, (2) Executing these planned actions, and (3) xxxxxx the effects of these actions to ensure they are successful.  These modules will be organized into layers, operating at different levels of abstraction and with different time constants and time horizons.  The architecture will support both hierarchical coordination between layers of control and peer-to-peer interaction among modules within a layer.  This proposal is innovative in combining centralized planning for hierarchical coordination with distributed negotiation techniques for peer-to-peer coordination to provide flexible contingency response.  The successful completion of a xxxxxx project will deliver a system health management architecture to xxxxxx that improves system safety and makes more effective use of human time and capabilities when problems occur.	13452
User-Augmented Visualizations for Targeted Evaluation of Systems and Technologies, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	The operation of xxxxxx Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in xxxxxx xxxxxx (NAS) is a growing area of research for xxxxxx, but the need for substantial amounts of research on the UAV-in-NAS concept is overwhelming. Furthermore, the quantity and nature of research questions on UAV-in-NAS operations are somewhat unpredictable as this research progresses, thereby requiring xxxxxx to have flexible research tools and adaptable methodologies. To address these issues, we propose to develop the UAV-TEST toolset (xxxxxx-Augmented xxxxxxizations for xxxxxxed Evaluation of xxxxxxs and Technologies). UAV-TEST will be a user-centered methodology that helps streamline the research process for UAV-in-NAS research at xxxxxx and enhances the process of generating and connecting new measures, research questions, and visualizations. This concept will be instantiated within a flexible, low-cost toolset that seamlessly integrates with current research tools at xxxxxx. The ultimate goal of the UAV-TEST product is to enable researchers to obtain clear and rapid assessments of key human factors issues in simulated flight environments.

Fiber Optic Shape Sensing for Tethered Marsupial Rovers, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	Luna xxxxxxovations xxxxxxorporated is proposing to design, build, and test a shape, length, and tension sensing tether for robotic exploration and sample-gathering missions on remote planets and moons.  The proposed tether system is capable of determining the location and orientation of marsupial robots as they navigate difficult terrain.  The tether system will also provide shape and tension information along the entire tether, distinguishing elevation changes, tension due to snags, and potential points of harm.  The tension feedback is particularly crucial, as it can be used to determine whether the rover has fallen down a slope or cliff, lost traction, or whether it is still moving under its own power.  The system is based on Luna's unique fiber optic position and shape sensing technology, and is an enabling technology for obtaining images, data, and samples in areas with difficult terrain.  In addition to providing new, vital feedback, the fiber optic shape sensor within the tether is lightweight, small, and flexible.  Luna's unique shape sensing fiber also has the potential to provide both communication and power through the same fiber, further reducing the size and weight of the total tether package.	13454
Multi-Environment MLI: Novel Multi-functional Insulation for Mars Missions, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	Human exploration requires advances in cryogenic propellants for missions to Earth orbit, cis-lunar, xxxxxx and beyond. xxxxxx is interested in improving thermal insulation for future xxxxxx missions, including xxxxxx, xxxxxx and xxxxxx ISRU cryogenic fuel storage on xxxxxx surface. xxxxxxgenic propellants have the highest energy density of any chemical rocket fuel, propel most xxxxxx and commercial launch vehicles, and would be used for xxxxxx xxxxxx EDL/ascent.  xxxxxxgenic propellants require good thermal insulation.  Improvements in propellant storage and transfer are a critical need for future xxxxxx missions, with zero boil off of cryogenic propellant an important goal. High performance insulation is needed for future xxxxxx missions to store liquid methane obtained from the xxxxxx regolith and stored on xxxxxx surface.  xxxxxx Group proposes to design and develop an innovative, lightweight thermal insulation system, designed to perform and insulate cryogenic propellants in multiple environments, such as in-air on Earth prelaunch and launch ascent, in-space cruise phase, on-xxxxxx surface and during xxxxxx xxxxxx ascent. xxxxxx-Environment MLI (MEMLI) is a novel multi-functional thermal insulation system that uses a ventable/sealable, lightweight supported vacuum shell, integrated and supported by xxxxxx Bearing MLI layers specifically tuned for xxxxxx atmosphere.

Materials for Advancement of MXER Tether Design (1000-549), Phase II	2006-11-01	2018-07-19	There exist a need to develop, identify, and classify various materials that can be used in the fabrication of electrodynamic tethers for various applications.  These applications consist of but not limited to power generation, orbital maneuvering, and planetary exploration.  A momentum exchange (MXER) tethers utilizes the electrodynamic tether interaction with the planetary magnetic field to provide thrust to a payload in xxxxxx (LEO).  While technological challenges, both materials and non-materials related, currently limit the utilization of the MXER concept, significant advances in materials science will allow the maturation of the system into a viable technology for propulsion in and beyond LEO.  xxxxxx materials-related advances are primary for improving the operation and lifetime of the propulsion system.  Critical materials properties in need of improvement include increases in tensile strength, electrical conductivity, shock resistance, continued flexibility during exposure to an environment rich in radiation and energetic atomic oxygen.

Mars Aqueous Processing System, Phase II	2006-11-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx Aqueous xxxxxx xxxxxx (MAPS) is a novel technology for recovering oxygen, iron, and other constituents from lunar and xxxxxx soils. The closed-loop process selectively extracts and then recovers constituents from soils using acids and bases. The emphasis on xxxxxx is production of useful materials such as iron, silica, alumina, magnesia, and concrete with recovery of oxygen as a byproduct. On the xxxxxx, similar chemistry is applied with emphasis on oxygen production. Most lunar LOx processes only reduce FeO, which is generally present at just 10 to 15 percent in soils. All of the soil must be heated to reduce the contained FeO, resulting in substantial heat transfer issues. Thermal power requirements per unit of oxygen recovered are reduced by an order of magnitude and hydrogen losses are minimized if only a small mass of high-grade iron oxide concentrate, such as that produced by MAPS, is subjected to hydrogen reduction.MAPS is significant because it can be co-developed for xxxxxx and xxxxxx applications. The process would be commissioned first for oxygen production on the xxxxxx. xxxxxx enhancements for manufacture of additional products would be implemented on the xxxxxx and then on xxxxxx, thereby reducing risks and costs.	13457

Cavitation Peening of Aerospace Bearings, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	High-value bearings are a critical part of the safety, reliability, cost and performance of modern aircraft. A typical passenger jet will have 100 to 175 high-valve bearings costing from $2,500 to $50,000 each for a total aircraft cost of $300,000 to $600,000.  All gas turbine engine bearings are inspected at overhaul and typically 30-40% of there are rejected. For each engine overhaul, bearing replacement costs on average $100,000.  Any process that increases bearing performance and reliability will have a commensurate effect on aircraft safety, reliability, performance and operating cost. Ormond is proposing to use a novel surface enhancement process, cavitation peening, to impart deep, high magnitude residual stresses without roughening the bearing such  as to significantly enhance bearing life, reliability and performance.  Cavitation peening uses ultra-high pressure water jets to generate intense clouds of cavitation bubbles that collapse on the work piece generating shock waves that cold work the material. No particles are used, the process produces no waste, adds no weight to the part and is very inexpensive. The new technology is currently being evaluated by Boeing, xxxxxx, Bell and Rolls-Royce for aerospace applications and is proving particularly effective for gears. A 20% improvement in bearing life is targeted. This project would generate the residual stress and fatigue data for bearings to convince stakeholders of the value of the technology for this application.	13466

Improving the Response of Silicon Carbide Devices to Cosmic Radiation, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	The ultimate goal of this proposal is to provide xxxxxx space SEE and TID tolerant high voltage and low on-resistance silicon carbide power devices that meet the capability performance goals in the xxxxxx technology roadmap. These objectives are important for the upcoming missions such as xxxxxx, xxxxxx probe and xxxxxx. Additionally, improving the single event / radiation hardness of silicon carbide devices would benefit the xxxxxxn spacecraft project in terms of power and advanced space power systems in terms of mass. Specifically mass savings are tremendous with the use of radiation hardened high voltage and power devices: A possible use of 300 V solar arrays instead of the 120 V option for solar electric propulsion would decrease the payload by as much as 2.5 tons with larger voltage operation resulting in further weight cuts. This is only practically achievable using radiation hardened silicon carbide devices as the silicon on-resistance versus radiation hardening penalty renders the silicon option not beneficial for conversion efficiencies. To achieve space SEE and TID tolerant silicon carbide power devices, we will follow two parallel paths.First, we are partnering with Cree (Wolfspeed) to determine heavy ion and TID susceptibility of their xxxxxx 1200 V power MOSFETs. We will also devise experiments to understand and identify failure mechanisms leading to the measured behavior. In xxxxxx I, we will pursue these experiments, and start device modeling these xxxxxx devices. In xxxxxx, we will build on this foundation to come up with possible rad-hard designs that will be newly fabricated and tested. xxxxxxond, xxxxxx also plans to design, lay out and fabricate xxxxxx based silicon carbide high voltage / power devices.

The lack of high temperature tolerat cameras and optical sensors has, to date, prevented up-close in-situ analysis of the xxxxxxian surface.  In this xxxxxx we will close that technology gap by developing a miniature xxxxxx cooler, suitable for integration with a sensor package at the end of an effector or robot arm, which is capable of keeping conventional electronics cool outside of the spacecraft body in the high temperature xxxxxx environment.  This advance would vastly expand the list of technologies which can be deployed on the surface of xxxxxx, and correspondingly advance the types of science that can be performed.

Investigation of Effect of High, Short Duration Temperatures on Fiber Graphitization and Resulting Property Changes in 3D Woven TPS Preforms During Entry Trajectories, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	To address the need for low-ballistic coefficient aeroshells with minimal impact on vehicle weight, xxxxxx is investigating flexible thermal protection system (TPS) options. These designs typically consist of a flexible three-directional (3D) woven carbon cloth that can be stowed during flight and deployed on command to serve as a semi-rigid aeroshell during atmospheric entry. For some planned entry trajectories, the woven TPS is subjected to short duration, but extremely high heat flux levels. Since current plans call for the use of as-received non-heat treated carbon fibers in the WTPS, MR&D aims to investigate whether exposure to high temperature, short duration temperatures alters the graphitic microstructure and thus the properties of PAN-based carbon fibers.	13486
Gas-Kinetic Navier-Stokes Solver for Hypersonic Flows in Thermal and Chemical Non-Equilibrium, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx project proposes to develop a gas-kinetic xxxxxx solver for simulation of hypersonic flows in thermal and chemical non-equilibrium. The xxxxxx solvers adopted in current hypersonic CFD codes like LAURA and GASP use xxxxxx solver for the convection part and central scheme for the diffusion part. As a result, their integration with xxxxxx in the transitional and rarefied flow regimes may cause an artificial flow across the interface between CFD/xxxxxx zones because of the inconsistency in the estimated fluxes. On the other hand, the proposed gas-kinetic BGK solver for xxxxxx equations (BGK-NS) computes the inviscid and viscous fluxes as a single entity, consistent with the xxxxxx approach. Furthermore, this BGK-NS solver has been demonstrated very accurate for hypersonic heat transfer prediction. The approach has also been successfully extended for solution of the xxxxxx equations whereas the macroscopic xxxxxx approach has some numerical difficulties. This xxxxxx project will further extend this BGK-NS solver to hypersonic flows in thermal and chemical non-equilibrium. In xxxxxx I, a prototype non-equilibrium BGK-NS solver will be developed for the nitrogen shock dissociation cases and then in xxxxxx, a gas-kinetic CFD counterpart of LAURA will be fully developed and well validated.	13487

We anticipate that the design will result in significant improvements in dynamic range, sampling speed, reliability, and reduced power consumption over existing instruments.  In a xxxxxx embodiment, a single microradiometer forms the basis of a very small (much less than 2.5 cm diameter) single-channel submersible light sensor that can be deployed in support of coastal research opportunities.  In another application, clusters of microradiometers can be matched with front end optics (collector/window/filter stack) to form small, fast, less expensive multiwavelength radiometers for a variety of measurements ? even hyperspectral applications.  We call this configuration the xxxxxx xxxxxxradiometer xxxxxx (MMS).  These MMS systems can be packaged into small underwater housings suitable for deployment on drifters, moorings, towed vehicles, and vertical profilers."	13490
Safety via Thermal Shutdown for Space Rated Batteries, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx battery safety has inspired many safety features from CID, to safety valves. xxxxxxver,  none of the current features protect a battery from internal over-current, which can be caused by foreign material contamination, dendrite formation, defects in separator or high impact on the battery. Another problem is that these devices shut-down the function of the entire battery, even when the problem arises from a localized spot. The entire battery shutdown is costly, especially when the battery size increases. xxxxxx batteries are especially of concern because of long mission life and large battery size.xxxxxx is interested in using a novel material developed by UCSB as a means to accomplish a battery which eliminates short circuits via a thermal trigger; this material could be used to develop safe, high-energy high energy, long life li-ion space rated batteries.	13491

Concept of Operations Storyboarding Tool, Phase II	2008-12-01	2018-07-19	The purpose of this project is to develop a storyboard tool to assist with the generation, verification, and refinement of storyboard information and its subsequent translation into model data for systems analysis and design tools.  The most important contribution is an improved communication of the concept of operation between prospective customers and system developers.  It addresses the difficulty of communicating highly technical information among specialized engineering groups so that the concept of operations illustrated by the storyboard accommodates the consideration of context of use, user task performance, and effective application of new technologies.  This difficulty is especially pronounced when the user's tasks are unusual (space operations) and the technology to support the task is novel (autonomous software with which humans interact and monitor).  Communication is enhanced by focusing on the common language of storyboard sketches and related categories of information describing them.  The storyboard tool will help authors manage versions of storyboards to track alternate approaches for human task support and to maintain libraries of storyboards from previous systems.  After assisting with the creation of storyboards and refining them in concurrent engineering sessions, the tool will assist in translating the storyboard information into data forms importable by analysis tools used by xxxxxx systems engineers.	13493

An environment insensitive package will be used to minimize the laser phase noise and linewidth.  Ho3+-doped fiber is used for seed laser generation, due to its strong emission at 2.05 micron. A Piezo attached to the laser cavity is used to modulate the frequency to 5 GHz with speed up to 10KHz.  The laser can be continuously tuned over 10 nm range.   The single frequency 2.05-micron fiber laser can be used to build coherent laser radars and Differential Absorption xxxxxxs (DIALs) to perform instant measurement of velocity and concentration of xxxxxx and other gases , aerosols, clouds.

Development of computational infrastructure to support hyper-resolution large-ensemble hydrology simulations from local-to-continental scales	2017-04-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxment of computational infrastructure to support hyper-resolution large-ensemble hydrology simulations from local-to-continental scalesA move is currently afoot in the hydrologic community towards multi-model ensembles to capture the substantial uncertainty in environmental systems. xxxxxxver, the current generation of operational and experimental simulation platforms can be characterized as 'small ensemble' systems. Typically, fewer than five hydrologic models are used to characterize model uncertainty, and the multi-model systems have a poor probabilistic portrayal of risk. As a result, water resource management decisions based on these 'small ensemble' systems will often be suboptimal and in the worst case will simply be wrong. The relatively small size of the ensembles in current multi-model systems is largely dictated by the considerable difficulty and human resources needed to implement and parameterize individual hydrological models so that they can be operated within a common framework.We have developed an advanced hydrologic modeling approach, SUMMA (the Structure for Unifying xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxernatives), which enables explicitly representing the ambiguities in a myriad of modeling decisions. SUMMA can be used to design ensemble systems with specific properties and improve the probabilistic characterization of risk. SUMMA is currently at Technical Readiness xxxxxx 3, and focused effort on computational infrastructure is necessary to develop the next-generation modeling system needed to support water resources planning and management throughout the xxxxxx.The goal of this project is to develop the computational infrastructure to enable hyper-resolution large-ensemble hydrology simulations from local-to-continental scales. By hyper-resolution we mean hydrology simulations on spatial scales of the order of 1 km and by large ensemble we mean a multi-model ensemble of the order of 100 ensemble members. The continental-scale domain for this project is the contiguous xxxxxx.The goal of hyper-resolution, large-ensemble, continental-domain hydrology simulations will be accomplished with focused effort on the following four tasks:(1)Satisfy data requirements of multiple modeling approaches (e.g., spatial parameter fields);(2)Improve SUMMA's numerical robustness and computational efficiency;(3)Embed SUMMA in the xxxxxx xxxxxxd Information xxxxxx (xxxxxx-xxxxxx) to expand multi-model simulation capabilities; and(4)Evaluate and refine the multi-model ensemble.These tasks represent the obvious next steps to advance probabilistic continental-domain modeling capabilities at spatial scales relevant for water managers. The first two tasks of fulfilling data requirements for multiple modeling approaches and improving the computational performance of hydrologic models is necessary to enable hyper-resolution, large-ensemble, continental-domain hydrology simulations. The third task of embedding SUMMA in xxxxxx-xxxxxx takes advantage of xxxxxx state-of-the-art multi-model framework, especially its ensemble modeling and model benchmarking capabilities. It also extends the capabilities of xxxxxx-xxxxxx to support large multi-model ensembles. The final task to evaluate and refine the multi-model ensemble is necessary to improve the probabilistic characterization of risk. By using a common modeling core in SUMMA, the overhead associated with implementing alternative modeling approaches is significantly reduced, a major departure from current 'small ensemble' methods. By embedding SUMMA within xxxxxx xxxxxxd Information xxxxxx (xxxxxx), meaningful 'large ensemble' systems will become a reality and can provide improved guidance for water resource management decisions by our development partners at the xxxxxx Army Corps of xxxxxxs and the Bureau of Reclamation.	13497
Geiger-Mode SiGe Receiver for Long-Range Optical Communications, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	The objective of this program is to develop, demonstrate and implement a photon-counting detector array sensitive in the wavelength range from 1000 nm to 1600 nm, with monolithically integrated time-tagging electronics, suitable for free-space optical communications, where high data volume returns from space missions are critical, such as in the xxxxxx Communication Demonstration (xxxxxx) and other future xxxxxx missions. Conventional photon counting detector arrays are implemented in either xxxxxx (Si) or Mecury xxxxxx (xxxxxx), negating detection at wavelengths longer than about 1000 nm in the case of Si or incurring high cost and complexity for xxxxxx. In this program, Freedom Photonics will develop a novel xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx (SiGe) receiver for photon counting applications with increased sensitivity for wavelengths in the range of 1000 nm to 1600 nm, which utilizes standard BiCMOS process, resulting in a low-cost, high-sensitivity, high-speed and radiation hard receiver for long-range optical communications.	13498
New Alkali Metal Flow Battery for Terrestrial and Aerospace Energy Storage Applications	2012-09-01	2018-07-19	"This seedling task is to develop new lithium-based flow batteries that will provide several fold improvements in specific energy, cost, simplicity and lifetimes, compared to the state-of-art energy storage technologies for planetary habitats as well as terrestrial applications (stationary needs, grid storage, and transportation). These new 'flow' batteries utilize a \"liquid\" anode, i.e., lithium naphthalenide solution and a high-energy, soluble organic or inorganic permiable membrane.Renewable energy sources, including wind and solar, can supply a significant amount of electrical energy globally, but their potential has not been fully exploited yet, due to their intermittent nature, which requires safe, cost-effective, and reliable electrical energy-storage systems. Such storage systems will also be critical to improve the robustness and efficiency of the electrical distribution grid by reducing power surges and balancing the load over time. xxxxxxchemical energy-storage devices, i.e., batteries and fuel cells, are promising because of their scalability and versatility, but most fuel cells cannot be reversed electrically (i.e., charged) efficiently. Consequently, batteries, especially flow batteries, wherein the energy density can be increased independently of power density, remain as the preferred option for large-scale energy storage. Several types of flow batteries, i.e., including true redox systems, (ionic solutions comprising vanadium salts or iron-chromium salts), reversible fuel cells with gaseous reactants, and hybrid flow batteries (e.g., metallic anodes as in Zn-Br, or xxxxxx), are being developed. xxxxxx is perhaps the most developed flow battery, but still has several deficiencies, such as: i) Low energy densities, (~ 25 Wh/kg, and 20-30 Wh/liter, which is about 1/5th of conventional xxxxxx batteries), ii) Low efficiency of 60%, and iii) Non-ecomomic cost (~ 6-20 times the target of $100/kWh, mainly due to high cost of xxxxxx reactants and Nafion membranes. To mitigate these issues, new chemically-stable redox couples, with high cell voltage (possible only in non-aqueous electrolytes) are desired and being proposed here to improve energy and power densities."	13499
Integrated Inflatable Ballute for Planetary Entry, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	CFDRC and xxxxxxA are proposing to develop, design, and test a mass-optimized isotensoid inflatable structure that makes maximum utilization of materials in providing tailored stiffness and rigidity for hypersonic entry vehicles. The proposed inflatable structure is a hybrid isotensoid pressure restraint employing an impervious cloth-reinforced barrier structure enveloped by an integrated array of high-tenacity tendons. The segregation of material functions provides greater design flexibility to meet stiffness and thermal protection requirements, while the external grid of cordage tendons provides mass- and load pathway-optimized containment of the structure's global pressure loads.  The focus of the xxxxxx I effort is to develop and demonstrate the isotensoid inflatable structure, complete with thermal protection hardware and load bearing attachment fittings for guidance and control hardware. The tendon materials will be evaluated for their strength at high temperatures while cloth structural materials will be evaluated for their stiffness and thermal insulation properties to produce a truly multifunctional structural enclosure. xxxxxxted fluid-structure-thermal simulations will be conducted with CFDRC's validated tools to provide insight into the aerodynamic, material stress and localized heating effects on the model and to verify/optimize the proposed design. xxxxxx activities will focus on fabricating and testing a prototype of the proposed inflatable structure to validate the design robustness and capability for larger payload masses. Pre and post testing multidisciplinary simulations will be conducted to verify and optimize the design. Additional simulations will be conducted for verification under exact flight conditions.	13500
Vacuum Compatible Percussive Dynamic Cone Penetrometer, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx proposes to develop a vacuum compatible percussive dynamic cone penetrometer (PDCP), for establishing soil bin characteristics, with the ultimate intent of taking it to a flight system level.  Penetrometers are used to determine the Cone index (CI), which is a composite index influenced by both soil compressibility and shear strength. A dynamic cone penetrometer is used to estimate bearing strength, soil compressibility, and shear strength (when compared with calibration data), consisting of a percussive actuator and a rod with a sharp 60 degree cone at the end. The penetrometer is driven into the soil under constant load and the penetration, converted to xxxxxx Bearing Ratio (CBR), which gives an indication of soil trafficability. The xxxxxx-developed percussive dynamic cone penetrometer offers the significant advantage of being a low mass, low power, low force, stand alone device that requires limited to no human intervention to operate, as opposed to heavy and cumbersome manual xxxxxx (DCP) widely used today. This percussive system is also of further advantage with its capability to reach much greater depths than typical surface tools such as xxxxxx. The high-frequency vibration of the percussive rod also reduces the force required for pushing a rod into regolith by almost two orders of magnitude. This translates directly into smaller rover/lander or less effort on behalf of an xxxxxx.	13501
Low AC-loss MgB2 Superconductors for Turbo-electric Aircraft Propulsion Systems, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	The development of magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconducting wires makes possible the potential to have much lighter weight superconducting stator and rotor coils for heavy aircraft motors and generators than with any other metal or ceramic superconductor.  The MgB2 superconductor can be cooled to 20 K by liquid hydrogen fuel or conductively with a cyrocooler.   The lighter weight coils, especially in the stator, will enable a lighter weight motor/generator.  In a xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx I and xxxxxx program we want to develop low AC loss MgB2 superconductors for the stators of synchronous motors or generators. For turbo-electric aircraft propulsion systems, it is desirable to have very light weight superconducting wires that can operate at greater than 1.5 T field and 500 Hz electrical frequency with input power between 10 and 100 kW. This xxxxxx xxxxxx I aims to design, fabricate, and characterize AC-tolerant superconductors with a targeted loss budget less than 10 W/kA-m. This will be accomplished by reducing the hysteretic losses in MgB2 superconductors by fabricating wires with very small filaments, reducing the eddy current component of AC losses in MgB2 superconductors, and characterizing the transport current and AC losses of MgB2 wires.	13502

A Green, Safe, Dual-pulse Solid Motor for CubeSat Orbit Changing, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	Small satellites such as xxxxxx are in need of responsive propulsion, but are limited due to their size. Though single pulse, AP/HTPB fueled solid rocket motors exist in the market, greater mission flexibility is to be had from a motor with the capability of a second ignition in the same volume constraints. Digital xxxxxx State Propulsion (DSSP) proposes research into the technology to not only to enable a second pulse from a high thrust solid rocket motor, but also into a safer class of propellants called xxxxxx (ESPs). A barrier system, developed on other DSSP programs, would be the stepping stone for the dual pulse ability of the motor. The ESPs are a group of propellants that are electrically ignited, but safer to handle compared to standard solid energetic propellants. For in-space use, Aluminized variant of ESP would be improved and utilized for this application. xxxxxx I funding would allow for the advancements of these technologies to a xxxxxx 3. Then following basic research and design goals of a xxxxxx I contract, a xxxxxx contract would allow the design and test of an integrated xxxxxx-V and ACS propulsion into a 1U module at xxxxxx 6.	13504

Miniature, Low Power Gas Chromatograph with Sample Pre-Processing Capability and Enhanced G-Force Survivability for Planetary Missions, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Thorleaf xxxxxxearch, xxxxxx. proposes to develop a miniaturized, low power gas chromatograph (GC) with sample pre-processing capability and enhanced capability for handling high inertial loads in a modular design optimized for integration into flight instrumentation. Our innovative approach employs a miniature sampling valve and loop to provide selective pre-concentration of trace level compounds from the sample stream using adsorbents and/or cryogenic focusing. This leak-tight design minimizes the number of components and tubing connections, thereby reducing instrument volume and mass while enhancing system robustness and improving inertness. We believe it will be possible to develop the miniaturized GC system at a mass of about 1 kg, average power consumption of less than 0.5 watts for isothermal operation, and sample pre-concentration factors of up to 1000x, with capability to withstand a kilo-g.

This will allow xxxxxx to take advantage of strides being made by industry to drive our development and reduce sustaining costs. The project team will also evaluate emerging technologies in industry and academia to ensure that other potentially beneficial concepts are not overlooked.The reference architecture will be developed by dividing it into four core areas: Command and xxxxxx xxxxxx (C&amp;DH), Wireless and Communications, xxxxxxs, and Software. The hardware selected for these core areas will typically be mid/high xxxxxx and currently available. The hardware must also have lineage that gives the team confidence that a radiation tolerant version that can survive the environment beyond Earth orbit and will be available within a reasonable time.&nbsp;The C&amp;DH xxxxxx will focus on the areas of processors and single board computers, network architecture and hardware, instrumentation systems, and hardware/network standards.

A xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxing Directorate Internal xxxxxxearch and xxxxxxment (IR&amp;D) project initially seeded analysis and prototyping into the applicability of CFS toward human rated systems. This effort was augmented in xxxxxxe 2012 under AES funding specifically targeted to utilize the xxxxxxn platform as a target architecture supporting a concept mission to xxxxxx point.

In-Situ Resource Utilization: Oxygen Production	2020-09-01	2018-07-19	The leading option for extracting oxygen from the xxxxxx atmospheric carbon dioxide is to use a solid oxide electrolyzer, which removes one oxygen atom from the xxxxxx molecule, ionizes it, and pulls it through a solid electrolyte by applying an electrical potential across the cell.&nbsp; An assessment of the&nbsp;state-of-the-art is being performed to examine past and&nbsp;current development efforts in dry xxxxxx solid oxide electrolysis (SOE), and to identify&nbsp;key enablers and critical technology gaps for achieving the scale-up, stable performance, and long life needed for future human missions to the xxxxxx surface.&nbsp; Differences in fabrication methods, reliability, scalability, thermal cycling, thermal ramp rates, thermal gradients among the ceramic layers, operating pressure, stack sealing, and longevity are also being evaluated.Structural and thermal modeling of a small stack is leading to new designs for the manifolds to increase structural strength and improve gas distribution through the stack.&nbsp; xxxxxx manifold designs,&nbsp;3D printed out of zirconia oxide to match the thermal expansion coefficient in the stack,&nbsp;will be tested for fluid and structural performance.&nbsp; In FY19 and FY20, small scale SOE stacks from multiple commercial providers will be procured and independently tested and characterized in xxxxxx facilities.xxxxxx production is part of the AES xxxxxx xxxxxxource Utilization (ISRU) xxxxxx Project which is developing the component, subsystem, and system technology to enable production of mission consumables from regolith and atmospheric resources at a variety of destinations for future human exploration missions.&nbsp;The overall goals of the ISRU xxxxxx project&nbsp;are to achieve system-level xxxxxx 6 to support future flight demonstration missions&nbsp;and provide exploration architecture teams with validated, high-fidelity answers for mass, power, and volume of ISRU systems.The project&#39;s initial focus is on critical technology gap closure&nbsp;and component development in a relevant environment (xxxxxx 5) for xxxxxxource Acquisition (excavation, drilling, atmosphere collection, and preparation/beneficiation before processing) and xxxxxxource xxxxxx &amp; Consumable Production (extraction and processing of resources into products with immediate use as propellants, life support gases, fuel cell reactants, and feedstock for construction and manufacturing). &nbsp;The interim project goal is to complete ISRU subsystem&nbsp;tests in a relevant environment to advance the&nbsp;subsystem to xxxxxx&nbsp;6. &nbsp;The project end goals are to perform end-to-end ISRU system tests in a relevant environment (system xxxxxx 6)&nbsp;and integrated ISRU-exploration elements demonstrations in a relevant environment.ISRU is a disruptive capability that enables more affordable exploration than today&rsquo;s paradigm where all supplies are brought from Earth, and allows more sustainable architectures to be developed.&nbsp; The availability of ISRU technologies can radically change the mission architecture&nbsp;and be the sizing design driver for other complex systems already in development. For example, the current xxxxxx architecture assumes ISRU production of up to 30 metric tons of propellant on the xxxxxx surface in order to reduce the ascent vehicle landed mass by 75 percent and reduce Earth launch needs by at least 300 metric tons. If a decision was made to use storable propellants for the xxxxxx ascent vehicle instead of ISRU-producible oxygen and methane, many other drastic changes to the architecture could be required, such as lander and ascent vehicle size, number of landers needed, surface operations for ascent vehicle fueling, and xxxxxx rendezvous orbit.&nbsp;Other surface systems might become more complex or heavier if they are not designed to take full advantage of ISRU technologies. xxxxxx include a more complex closed-loop life support system if resupply with ISRU water cannot be assumed, or a heavy, built-in habitat radiation shield if a water- or regolith-based shield cannot be added after habitat delivery to the surface.Other system designers may also make decisions that reduce the benefit of incorporating ISRU into the mission, resulting in a larger or more inefficient ISRU system. For example, a non-continuous power source such as solar power would increase the required production rate and peak power of an ISRU plant, thus increasing its size and complexity due to hundreds of start-stop cycles.&nbsp; xxxxxxver, a continuous power source, such as nuclear or solar power with storage, would allow an ISRU plant to operate continuously, thus minimizing its size, complexity, and power draw. These are only a few examples of how the inclusion of ISRU has ripple effects across many other exploration elements.ISRU is also a new capability that has never before been demonstrated in space or on another extraterrestrial body.&nbsp; Every other exploration system or element, such as power, propulsion, habitats, landers, life support, rovers, etc., have some form of flight heritage, although almost all still need technology development to achieve the objectives of future missions. This is another critical reason why ISRU technology development, leading to a flight demonstration mission, needs to be started now, so that flight demonstration results can be obtained early enough to ensure that lessons learned can be incorporated into the final design.	13518

Scalable Solution Processing of Pristine Carbon Nanotubes for Self-Assembled, Tunable Materials with Direct Application to Space Technologies	2018-08-01	2018-07-19	Current material technologies limit space exploration and vehicle performance due to often unnecessary mass increase from copper wiring or heavy structural composites.   Replacement of these materials to impart lower mass footprints should alleviate this stress and improve equipment efficiency.

Simulator Evaluation of a Joint Human/Automated Upset Recovery System and Training Aid, Phase II	2013-05-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx of control is a significant cause of aviation accidents attributed to a large percentage of fatalities in the commercial aviation sector. Recently, Barron Associates, xxxxxx. (BAI) has developed a system for unmanned aerial vehicles that autonomously executes recovery strategies to rapidly restore nominal flight. During xxxxxx I, BAI sought to extend this system to manned vehicles by developing a joint human-automated (H/A) system. The goal of this system is to assist the crew during the recovery process by conveying information about recovery procedures in an intuitive and unobtrusive manner. BAI developed crew-specific extensions to the automated system both at the architecture and interface level. The architecture defines what information is delivered to the crew. The interface defines how this information is presented to the crew. Metrics were defined to measure the quality of the recovery and crew experience. xxxxxx I pilot-in-the-loop experiments have shown there is the potential for significant performance gains and workload reduction if the joint H/A recovery system is used to guide the pilot through the recovery process. xxxxxx I experiments were limited in scope. During xxxxxx, BAI would like to build upon these results by demonstrating that gains become even more pronounced in a realistic cockpit environment. This will require migrating to a higher-quality simulator and more accurately simulating the duties of the crew. The team will target ATPs (Airline Transport Pilots) during xxxxxx and expand the subject population so that the benefit of the system can be explicitly quantified. While integration into the cockpit is the ultimate goal for this system, BAI believes that the joint H/A recovery system can be of immediate use as a training aid. As part of the experimental build-up, BAI would also like to show that the use of the joint H/A recovery system during training translates into improved pilot recoveries when the system is not active.	13536
Lunar Plants	2015-03-01	2018-07-19	We present an open design for a first plant growth module on the xxxxxx (LPX). The primary science goal of lunar habitat is to investigate germination and initial plant growth when subject to the combined effects of lunar gravity and lunar surface radiation. The LPX module has been designed to be a flexible base unit that can be adapted to fly to the lunar surface on a variety of landers and rovers. LPX has size and shape of a 1U CubeSat (10 cm on a side) and a total mass of 0.3 kg. The base will contain a seed module holding around 50 xxxxxx seeds and provide ~ 0.5 liter of normal air at standard pressure. By the action of a small pump, water will be released after landing to initiate germination. xxxxxx will document the germination, initial growth, phototropism, and circumnutation of the small plants while sunlight remains available. A xxxxxx sensor tracks the release of xxxxxx during germination and the subsequent uptake of xxxxxx by photosynthesis. Simulations indicate that the xxxxxx peak level will be an increase by 2250 ppm after 2 earth-days and then decline to about 1000 ppm after 7 earth-days. The camera and xxxxxx sensor interfaces are USB. The water pump initiation requires a 5 volt signal. After initiation of germination by the addition of water, the habitat must be maintained above 22&ordm;C to allow for plant growth and below 27&ordm;C to prevent damage to the plants. This relatively tight temperature tolerance will require thermal control systems using reflecting surfaces and insulation that must be specifically designed for each lander or rover. The plant growth unit will function to tilt angles of 20&ordm; along any axis. Total image data volume required to gauge the plant growth rate and leaf area is 1Mbyte (minimum data required) to 40 Mbyte (preferred data). The lid of the habitat will allow adequate sunlight for plant growth. To provide for optimum growth, light levels in the plant growth stage need to be between 75 and 150 umole m-2 s-1 in the 400 to 700 nm interval. xxxxxx xxxxxxt Experiment: xxxxxx plant germination in lunar gravity and ionizing radiation&nbsp;xxxxxxults of a Center xxxxxxovation Fund study at xxxxxx xxxxxx &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xxxxxxd xxxxxxh 2015&nbsp;PI: xxxxo-Is:xxxxxx, xxxxrwen Dav&eacute;, xxxxemil xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxx&nbsp;xxxxxx:We present an open design for a first plant growth module on the xxxxxx (LPX).

To provide for optimum growth, light levels in the plant growth stage need to be between 75 and 150 umole m-2 s-1 in the 400 to 700 nm interval.&nbsp;Background:The importance of plants for long-term life support in human bases on xxxxxx and xxxxxx has long been understood and is of continuing interest. xxxxxxver, there are very little data to show how plants will grow in the partial gravity and high radiation on the surface of the xxxxxx or xxxxxx. The vast literature on the growth of plants on the surface of the Earth has been augmented by a growing literature on plant growth in microgravity. How biology responds to partial gravity remains uncertain. It has been implicitly assumed by the mission planners who have been designing long-term human missions to the xxxxxx and xxxxxx that biological development and response to 1/3 and 1/6 gravity will be more akin to 1 g than to microgravity. Only recently have studies with small centrifuges on xxxxxx allowed for investigations at partial gravity begun to test this assumption.&nbsp;Major goals:The plant science goal for LPX is to demonstrate germination and initial growth in lunar gravity and radiation.&nbsp;The technical goal for LPX is to design a 1U habitat that can provide Earth normal atmosphere, sunlight, and water on the surface of the xxxxxx to support a variety of life sciences experiments.&nbsp;The expected LPX science results can be listed, in the following priority order, as:Germination in lunar gravity and radiationRate of growth (leaf area index) versus timeObservation of circumnuationObservation of phototropismxxxxxx release during germination and subsequent uptake by photosynthesis.&nbsp;xxxxxxure 1 shows an image of the plant growth stage with xxxxxx sprouts after 7 days of grown.

The habitat on the inside contains the seed module to hold seeds mounted on Whatman filter paper using guar gum, the water storage and pump delivery system, camera, xxxxxx sensor, and an electrical pass through.

The 1U CubeSat LPX habitat showing the camera, xxxxxx sensor, water delivery system, and plant growth stage. In this design there is a window in the top to allow sunlight to enter. Right panel shows a 3D model of the components suitable for 3D printing /machining.&nbsp;Seeds and seed growth platform:The primary plant used in our habitat is xxxxxx, used widely in plant physiology experiments on ISxxxxxx seeds will be carried in the seed module at the bottom of the habitat. The module is made from xxxxxx, an insulating and biocompatible material, to help stabilize the temperature of the seeds. There are furrows in the polymer, lined with erect blotter paper and polypropylene combs inserted in rows spaced 0.5 cm apart. This design is similar to shuttle and xxxxxx-heritage plant experiments. The comb provides air to the root system and ensures plants are adequately spaced for science imaging. Over 50 seeds can be accommodated in the LPX habitat. Over the 8 days of the nominal mission it is expected that the plants will reach a height of ~1 cm -1.5 cm. This sets the depth of focus required for the camera.&nbsp;Camera:The camera system is a small, high resolution web cam. These are commercially available units. Our basic design is based on a 180 degree fish-eye camera. The 180 degree lens causes geometric distortion of the image but this distortion can be easily corrected with image processing software. This type of lens allows not only to capture the root module but also look at the sides of the habitat where the water reservoir, pump and xxxxxx sensor are located. It also allows a depth of focus sufficient to image xxxxxx shoot growth up to 2 cm. The camera is located directly above the growth stage to look down on the plants providing the best view for determining the plant leaf area. The roots are not imaged in the current system. From these images we will be able to determine that germination has occurred, track the leaf area over time and track the position and orientation of individual plants. Ideally, the images will be obtained at a rate of one per six hours after water is added. xxxxxxver, to document circumnutation, it would be preferable to collect images at 5 minute intervals for at least 6 hours on one of the days (day 5,6, 7). Because the plants grow and move slowly, image compression can greatly reduce the total data volume that must be downloaded to Earth. The images from the camera also are used to determine the water state of the seed platform by use of small disks that change color when wetted.&nbsp;Water pump, reservoir bag, &amp; colorimetric water sensors:The water delivery system depends on pump pressure and capillary action to wet all seed module furrows. It consists of a water bag made of biocompatible material and a pump that serves as a valve until it is activated. Once activated it then pumps the water through a tube to a reservoir under the seed module that is packed with blotter paper with a layer of gauze cloth (cheese cloth). The absorbent paper wicks the moisture across the bottom of all seed furrows, which are also filled with blotter paper. The freeze-tolerant water bag has flown in space on xxxxxx - Roscosmos BION experiment (xxxxxxn is a 14-30 day xxxxxxn LEO biological experiments capsule). The current intended pump is a piezo electric micro pump. During the experiment colorimetric wetness indicators will show the extent to which water has wetted the seed module. This material turns red when exposed to liquid water and provides a way to use our images to confirm water delivery. This indicator tape has been tested for biocompatibility, freeze-thermal and vibration adhesion. Small disks that change color when wetted are placed in several locations on the plant growth stage.&nbsp;Passive pressure indicator:We will use a small piece of biocompatible plastic bubble wrap as a passive pressure indicator to detect total loss of pressure due to a leak.&nbsp;Container and seals:The habitat can be made of standard aerospace grade xxxxxx alloy T6061 for good thermal control. The habitat can also be 3D printed using aluminum powder or be made out of coated polysulphone /lexan. The lid of the container could be made of aluminum or a clear lexan panel or a combination of both- basically a lexan window in an aluminum lid. For the current design the habitat will be machined from an aluminum block with a lid and window top. Seals (O rings) used will be of the same material and tolerances as those used on similar previous experiments flown in space. An electrical pass-through will allow the lander to communicate with the habitat, initiating the sensor suite, and download imaging data. The final electrical pass-through would be selected based on the spacecraft interface requirements.&nbsp;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxent xxxxxxtion/Accommodation/Location xxxxxx:There are a few outline requirements to accommodate the payload with the lander. First, the habitat interior should be maintained between 22&ordm;C and 27&ordm;C and must not reach temperatures much over 27&ordm;C during the lunar day. xxxxxxondly, the habitat must be electrically connected to the lander computer for control and data transfer. Thirdly, the habitat should be placed such that is can receive natural sunlight (exposing the top window). There are two possible mounting locations: 1) On an external surface which will provide the best exposure; 2) Inside the lander and exposing the top window to sunlight. An alternative to use of sunlight might be inclusion of internal LEDs to provide sufficient light for germination and seedling growth. Use of internal LEDs provides sufficient lighting to insure experiment success, regardless of habitat position or window exposure to sunlight.&nbsp;xxxxxx Operations:Following is the sequence of operation for the habitat.The habitat can be assembled and seeds put in place a month or more before the flight (preferably &ndash; as close as possible to flight date).Once mounted the seeds stay dry and dormant during launch and flight to the surface of the moon. During this period the habitat does not require any power or data stream from the spacecraft. The seeds can survive temperature excursions from -160&ordm; to 55&ordm;C.Once on the surface on moon with lander ready to start experiments, this experiment will be initiated by obtaining a baseline xxxxxx reading, a reference image, and then activating the water pump to initiate germination.xxxxxx readings and images are then obtained as often as the data system can be accommodated, ideally once every 6 hours as described above.The xxxxxx reading and camera images are stored on board the spacecraft until offloaded by the computer.All data is downlinked to Earth for analysis by xxxxxx (It is not anticipated that the team will send commands to the habitat).&nbsp;In-xxxxxx xxxxxx and xxxxxx:There are no inflight calibration and testing requirements.&nbsp;xxxxxx xxxxxx:All raw data, calibration records, and processed data from LPX will be maintained in an updated form throughout the period of investigation. A continually updated record of the &quot;best version&quot; of the data will be maintained until meaningful changes in data calibration no longer occur.&nbsp;xxxxxx Reduction and xxxxxx:All images and data will be released to the public as they are downloaded and calibrated (within 24 hours). All data will be placed in the xxxxxx xxxxxx system within 30 days of data download. The final archival data will be stored in the xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx (PDS) within 90 days after download. xxxxxx will be processed by xxxxxx and plant height and leaf area will be determined on ground. The imaging sequences for growth, development, phototropism and circumnutation will be assembled into videos showing these characteristic plant motions. A publication of these results will be submitted within 90 days of complete data download.&nbsp;Performance Margins:The key performance requirement is on the camera. The baseline camera design use has a performance margin of at least a factor of 2. This means that the resolution of the images is 2 times the resolution needed for our science goals. This margin is maintained in the event of data bit dropout due to radiation effects.&nbsp;xxxxxx sensor:The xxxxxx sensor is a commercially available unit that is small, USB operated, and reads over a range of xxxxxx from 0 to 10,000 ppm &plusmn;50 ppm.&nbsp;Minimal xxxxxx:One quality image at day 5-8 is adequate to confirm if germination and early growth occurred. The record of xxxxxx provides an independent indication of germination and photosynthesis.&nbsp;Preferred xxxxxx:xxxxxx images of the plant growth area and xxxxxx readings every 6 hrs (or less) for the full duration following hydration. If not possible, then one image per day following hydration (to verify hydration event) followed by images every 6 hrs commencing with day 3.&nbsp;xxxxxx plan rationale:Minimal image data confirms that environmental conditions were sufficient for germination and early growth, resulting in photosynthetic tissues capable of generating O2. The preferred data provide for assessment of detailed plant growth including rates of germination and growth. Six-hour frequency of daytime images will demonstrate phototropism as the angle of incident light changes through the lunar day. A burst of images taken at 5 minute intervals, taken on approximately day 7 in late afternoon, for approximately 4-6 hours to document circumnutation. xxxxxx can be recorded and downlinked later as bandwidth permits. xxxxxxion of all of these earth-normal growth parameters will allow for detailed comparison of plant performance under earth conditions.&nbsp;xxxxxxent Test and Verifications xxxxxx:The standard collection of tests performed on flight instruments will be applied to the LPX habitat: thermal, vacuum, shock and vibration, extreme temperatures, etc. One test specific to life sciences experiments is extended biocompatibility tests of all habitat material to simulate the longest launch preparation, lunar transit stage, and landed mission (approximately 2 months).&nbsp;xxxxxxbased and xxxxxx controls:The scientific results of LPX must be compared to xxxxxxbased controls and xxxxxx microgravity, and partial gravity experiments. The 1U CubeSat design allows for easy replication by students and researchers on Earth and for accommodation on xxxxxx.&nbsp;Additional sensors:The basic LPX has only a xxxxxx sensor and a camera. xxxxxxver additional sensors could be considered in variants or future designs. These include:External temperatureIonizing radiationInternal temperatureInternal light level, intensity and spectrumInternal RHPressureO2 partial pressurexxxxxx absorbent&nbsp;Thermal Control:A key requirement for the success of LPX is temperature control. The range of temperature in the habitat after initiation of growth must be between 22&ordm;C and 27&ordm;C - a much narrower range of temperature than typical for flight electronics or flight instruments. This poses significant challenges. The general approach that is to design the LPX surface coatings and position on the lander such that the equilibrium temperature is ~20&ordm;C and then to add a small root module heater to bring the temperature up to desired range.&nbsp;The design of reflective and heat emitting surfaces and their coupling to the LPX module will depend on the landing latitude of mission. For missions equatorward of 45&ordm; the challenge will likely be keeping the habitat cool. For missions which land poleward of 45&ordm;, the challenge will likely be keeping the habitat warm. A significant variable in this problem is the extent to which the habitat is warmed by the lunar surface and light reflected from the spacecraft surfaces.&nbsp;This aspect of the LPX design will require considerable work specific to the mission architecture and the chosen landing site and hence can only be done after these are specified. xxxxxxlusion of an internal thermocouple and root module feedback-controlled heater greatly reduces reliance on external surfaces to maintain a biologically appropriate internal temperature.	13537

Low-Cost, Scalable, Hybrid Launch Propulsion Technology, Phase I	2017-06-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxical xxxxxxs xxxxxx. (PSI), in collaboration xxxxxx xxxxxxersity, proposes to develop a novel launch propulsion technology for rapid insertion of nano/micro satellites (~ 5-50 kg scale) into low earth orbit, with the potential to lower the current state-of-the-art launch stage cost by a factor of two. The technology employs a propulsion scheme comprising a storable liquid oxidizer and a unique solid fuel with excellent mechanical and thermochemical properties. The propulsion scheme was initially developed by PSI under DAxxxxxx programs for applications to in-space thrusters integrated in a consumable-structure spacecraft. The proposed application of this scheme to launch vehicle stage technology will result in low-cost, mass-efficient launch systems and will reduce the technical development risk for xxxxxx. The fuel used is commercially available as an inexpensive engineering material. The oxidizer is commercially available as a low-cost, industrial chemical. Both have high density, are green (halogen and nitrogen free), and their chemical reaction has a high specific impulse. The oxidizer storage, handling, transportation, and loading operations are simpler and safer compared to cryogenic or toxic propellants. These attributes of the fuel and oxidizer enable our proposed concept of a low-cost launch vehicle stage. The specific objective of xxxxxx I is to develop and analyze low-cost launch stage and thruster design concepts, and to develop and build a scaled prototype thruster hardware that will be used in both xxxxxx I and II to characterize thruster design and to obtain performance data for use in the launch stage and propulsion system design/analysis studies. At the end of xxxxxx I, we will have demonstrated the operation of the subscale thruster system and measured its performance. A plan for xxxxxx work, involving approaches to subscale ground testing or sub-orbital flight testing, will also be developed.	13542

Including the effects of a harsh radiation environment in the simulation and design of nanoelectronic devices and circuits, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxelectronic devices, and circuits based on such devices, are expectedto be more susceptible to the effects of radiation than the previousgeneration of devices and circuits.  Circuits that can operate in harshradiation environments are essential components of commercial satellitecommunications systems, space exploration vehicles, and national defensesystems.  Hence there is a critical need to understand and quantify theeffects of radiation on the present and next generation ofnanoelectronic circuits, and to develop methods to render such circuitsinsensitive to radiation.  In this project we intend to identify andcharacterize (as a function of device dimension if possible) thedeleterious effects of radiation on nanoscale devices.  Moreimportantly, we intend to build on the standard models, which describethe effects of radiation, and develop software that would enable themodeling and simulation of radiation effects.    First we will considerconventional nanoelectronic devices --- that is those where chargetransport is based on the usual principles of drift and diffusion.Then a tool for the effects of radiation on single electron transistorsand amplifiers (including those based on carbon nanotubes) would also bedeveloped. Using the software, methods to mitigate the effects ofradiation by rad-hard designs will be examined.	13545

Grasp Algorithms For Optotactile Robotic Sample Acquisition, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	"Robotic sample acquisition is basically grasping.  xxxxxx-finger robot sample grasping devices are controlled to securely pick up samples.  While optimal grasps for perfectly modeled objects are known, grasping unmodeled objects, like a surface sample, is an open research problem.  A major source of difficulty in robotic grasping, therefore, is the sensing of object parameters and grasp quality.  Humans combine the high information content of vision, several types of haptic/tactile sensors in the fingers, and a sophisticated learning process to grasp unknown objects.  In comparison, current robotic graspers rely on a much more limited set of sensors, particularly for measuring tactile properties.  We propose to develop an algorithm for robust robotic grasping of samples using measurements of object stiffness, incipient slip, and the shape of the contact area between grasper and sample.  All three measurements will be performed through a novel robotic grasper containing multiple cameras embedded within its soft silicone \"flesh\".  The proposed control algorithm will use these three measurements to improve a grasp by adjusting both contact point locations and grasp forces."	13550

Sensitivity Analysis and Error Control for Computational Aeroelasticity, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	The objective of this proposal is the development of a next-generation computational aeroelasticity code, suitable for real-world complex geometries, and incorporating error-control for superior reliability and efficiency, and sensitivity analysis for aeroelastic design problems.The principal enabling innovation for achieving these goals involves the development of adjoint methods for time-dependent coupled aeroelastic simulations.                                                                             The use of adjoint techniques has become widespread for steady-state aerodynamic design, and the potential of adjoint methods for controlling spatial error has been well documented. xxxxxxver, the extension of these methods to unsteady problems and coupled aero-structural problems has generally been lacking. Using a consistent and modular adjoint formulation, the proposed project will result in the incorporation of an adjoint methodology into an existing three-dimensional unstructured mesh aeroelastic simulation capability.                                                                             The adjoint methodology will enable revolutionary advances in efficiency and reliability for computational aeroelasticity, by providing the means of controlling temporal error through time-step control for relevant engineering outputs, such as the determination of flutter boundaries.  xxxxxx analysis will also be enabled, providing the means for performing aerodynamic shape optimization, structural modifications, as well as valuable information for guiding the placement, location and properties of flow control devices, actuators, and smart material technologies.	13552

Aircraft Sensor-Logger with Power Replenishment Capabilities, Phase II	2009-03-01	2018-07-19	"Traditional instrumentation of an aircraft is a complex and time-consuming chore.  Once the sensors are installed, long wires for power and data must be routed through to a central data collection location where several large off-the-shelf electronic components reside, adding weight, cost and increasing the probably of introducing noise or faults into the testing system.  All of this necessary infrastructure leads to prohibit the use of some types of sensors and limit the total number of sensors used so save on time, cost, complexity and resources.  During the course of this xxxxxx xxxxxx research, Metis Design Corporation (MDC) proposes to develop a standardized data acquisition hub for aircraft testing sensors dubbed a \"sensor-logger\".  The sensor-logger would essentially serve as a durable sensor infrastructure node capable of autonomously facilitating local testing for multiple sensors of various types.  Controlled wirelessly by PC or PDA, data could be displayed in real-time, or logged internally for up to 40 hours.  The second half of the proposed research would then tie together the sensor-logger with the xxxxxx I research, developing a power-replenishment device to attached to the sensor-logger to extend its operating capabilities.  Finally both devices will be flight tested in true aircraft environments."	13554

Multiple Kernel Learning for Heterogeneous Anomaly Detection: Algorithm and Aviation Safety Case Study	2010-09-14	2018-07-19	The world-wide aviation system is one of the most complex dynamical systems ever developed and is generating data at an extremely rapid rate. Most modern commercial aircraft record several hundred flight parameters including information from the guidance, navigation, and control systems, the avionics and propulsion systems, and the pilot inputs into the aircraft. These parameters may be continuous measurements or binary or categorical measurements recorded in one second intervals for the duration of the flight. Currently, most approaches to aviation safety are reactive, meaning that they are designed to react to an aviation safety incident or accident. In this paper, we discuss a novel approach based on the theory of multiple kernel learning to detect potential safety anomalies in very large data bases of discrete and continuous data from world-wide operations of commercial fleets. We pose a general anomaly detection problem which includes both discrete and continuous data streams, where we assume that the discrete streams have a causal influence on the continuous streams. We also assume that atypical sequences of events in the discrete streams can lead to off-nominal system performance. We discuss the application domain, novel algorithms, and also discuss results on real-world data sets. Our algorithm uncovers operationally significant events in high dimensional data streams in theaviation industry which are not detectable using state of the art methods.	13557

High Fidelity Modeling of Plume-Induced Soil Erosion During Lunar and Planetary Landing	2021-08-01	2018-07-19	During lunar and planetary landings, rocket plumes interact with the surface, ejecting soil and other particles into the surrounding environment.  These particles, traveling at high speeds, pose major challenges in the success of the mission.  They have been shown to damage the lander, inhibit visibility, and spoof sensors.  This is extremely hazardous both during manned and unmanned missions and therefore the intricate surface-plume interactions must be well characterized to for the success of future missions.    The primary objective of the proposed project is to perform high-fidelity simulations of rocket plume-surface interactions to obtain the necessary information required to mitigate their negative effects during landing.  This will be accomplished by (i) conducting detailed simulations of rocket-plume interactions at scales far beyond what is currently available, (ii) determining the mechanisms that lead to the ejection of surface particles, and (iii) using the data obtained from the simulations to develop simplified models that can be incorporated into existing xxxxxx codes.    The particle-laden flows considered here involve a wide range of complex multi-physics interactions.  xxxxxx simulations require accurate models to capture the high-speed plume, impinging shock waves, particle trajectories, and turbulent mixing.   To complete this research, a massively parallel particle-laden flow simulation tool will be used. Within this method, the exhaust plume and its corresponding flow features will be computed on an xxxxxxian grid while the particles will be tracked individually.  This simulation methodology will explicitly capture the two-way coupling effects between the phases that are anticipated to be of key importance, which is not possible with current techniques typically used to model landing events.   To accomplish the proposed objectives; the project will focus on method validation, physics analysis, design refinement, and model closure.  During method validation, simplified surface-plume interaction cases will be designed and tested to assess the capability of the numerical framework to capture the relevant physics. Simulations will then be compared to available landing data from manned and unmanned xxxxxx missions.  During this phase, additional physics models may need to be incorporated to improve the predictive capabilities.  Once this is achieved, a series of simulations will be conducted under a range of relevant conditions.  Finally, data obtained from the simulations will be used to inform model closure for existing xxxxxx codes.   The accurate prediction of surface-plume interactions is necessary for the overall success of future space missions.   While simulations of surface-plume interactions have been conducted in the past, they typically rely on simplifying assumptions that prevent a detailed analysis of the fluid-particle coupling.  The proposed research will provide a comprehensive description of the complex two-phase interactions at a level of detail beyond what is presently available.  To that end, results from this project will provide xxxxxx with the necessary data and strategies for the success of future space missions.	13559

Such a driver will greatly reduce the operation power, and are compact and reliable. When the ASIC driver is vertically integrated with a Deformable Mirror (DM), the potential wiring failure will be eliminated. Furthermore, radiation resistance will be emphasized during ASIC design. During xxxxxx I period, we had (1) verified the concept of the proposed floating driver for controlling an HV switch configured by a pair of transistors, (2) developed a high-voltage unity-gain buffer for tracing an isolated voltage signal, which is an essential tool towards developing switch arrays with high quality, (3) established the test methods for measuring switch parameters that directly impact the performance of a DM, (4) identified the main switch parameters, feedthrough and leakage, which are the primary impediments causing the drift of a stroke. All of the above made it possible for us to focus on (1) screen HV IC processes to find a qualified IC process with which a switch featuring low leakage can be fabricated, (2) apply decoupling technique to eliminate feedthrough, (3) manufacture an advanced 32x32 switch array with a voltage-resolution of 16-bit or beyond in xxxxxx.	13561

Integrated Cognitive Assessment: Combining Measurement, System, and Mission, Phase II	2011-03-01	2018-07-19	"Existing cognitive performance test batteries consist of synthetic tasks that, while they may probe isolated cognitive functions, provide an incomplete and unconvincing picture of an individual's true cognitive capacity within the total context of space missions. In essence, they are 'laboratory' measures that appear unrelated to the real-world environment. This leads to user non-compliance or rejection. The present proposal describes a technique for integrating traditional cognitive performance measures with assessment of the system and mission in which the individual must operate. This yields quantified measures of the person's cognitive ability to perform specific jobs in space. Specifically, an entertaining and scientifically rigorous assessment tool is integrated with a sleep/fatigue model and a quantified workload estimate for each task. This is accomplished by selecting tests based on task analyses of what the astronaut actually has to do, using the Fatigue xxxxxx xxxxxx Tool (FAST) to predict performance capacity as a function of sleep/rest, and integrating a mathematical vector to quantify the workload of specific tasks. The resulting \"Person-xxxxxx-Mission (PSM) index\" provides a totally new and unique way not only to assess present cognitive capability, but to diagnose specific causes of decrement, and to suggest remedial actions."	13572

UAS Demand Generator for Discrete Airspace Density, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	A key component to solving many engineering challenges of UAS integration into xxxxxx xxxxxx is the ability to state the numbers of forecasted UAS by airframe and mission/operation type being performed within discrete airspaces. UAS growth is a function of locational based businesses and public use needs, in addition to increases in UAS uses and future aircraft types. Being able to forecast this growth requires time consuming and highly detailed configuration and model development, consensus between different organizations, and flexible tools tunable to changing perspectives. Availability of a common cloud based application integrating varying growth curves and linking geospatial aspects of UAS operations will greatly enhance and stabilize system level analysis of issues such as: radio spectrum usage, safety case analysis, economic forecasts, etc. Individuals and organizations would benefit in using a community centric tool with the ability to shared data and projections while still allowing individual researchers to set up paradigms for their own, unique forecasts.  The overall project objective is to design, develop, and study the feasibility and potential benefits of a UAS Demand xxxxxx for xxxxxx (UAxpan) system which allows for common solutions in complex forecasts of growth and uses of numerous unmanned systems and mission/operational types.

IOS will use unique pigments whose fluorescence depends directly on absolute ambient pressure, not on the partial pressure of oxygen in the flow field, to develop coatings that will allow \"legacy\" (oxygen-based) visualization equipment to characterize flows in oxygen-free atmospheres. The new pigments will also be completely compatible with temperature indicating materials and binders currently used in temperature-compensated pressure sensitive paints.In xxxxxx I IOS will create two different oxygen-insensitive pressure-sensitive pigment materials, combine them with a suitable binder, and apply the resulting paints to stainless steel test coupons. The fluorescence of these test samples will be measured under varying static pressures of pure nitrogen, and imaged in a low-speed flow environment at varying angles of attack.

High-Speed, Noninvasive, Multi-Parameter Laser Diagnostics for Transonic Flows, Phase II	2018-03-01	2018-07-19	Numerous ground-test and wind-tunnel facilities are used extensively to make surface measurements of and to characterize the forces and moments encountered by aeronautics test articles. Quantitative results in these test environments are required to validate the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools that are used to extrapolate wind-tunnel data toward realistic flight conditions and hardware.  The development of fast instrumentation and measurement capabilities that can readily be integrated into the extreme conditions present under such test conditions is one of several major technological challenges associated with the design, building, and operation of these complex test environments.  Among the host of physical quantities, accurate mapping of velocity flow fields remains a significant yet essential challenge in these facilities.  In addition, spatially and temporally resolved measurements of other flow parameters, such as gas density, pressure, temperature, and species mixing fractions, are of paramount importance to characterize fully the fluid dynamics.  Unfortunately, the widely available current suite of flow-field probes exhibit varying degrees of intrusiveness, requiring either the physical placement of probes inside the test facility or the introduction of foreign particles or gas-phase species into the flow field.  Thus, the development and application of non-invasive flow-field diagnostic probe techniques is of principal importance in these environments.  This proposal expands upon our successful xxxxxx-I results and offers an integrated package of truly cutting-edge, multidimensional, seedless velocimetry and flow diagnostics for ground-test facilities.  The concepts and ideas proposed range from proof-of-principle demonstration of novel methodologies using kHz-rate femtosecond (10-15 sec) and 100-kHz-rate burst-mode picosecond (10-12 s) duration laser sources to measurements in realistic tunnel conditions expected in the current solicitation.	13583
Sealed Planetary Return Canister (SPRC), Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Sample return missions have primary importance in future planetary missions. A basic requirement is that samples be returned in pristine, uncontaminated condition, necessitating development of a canister system capable of maintaining cleanliness and seal integrity through a variety of environments. Such a canister system, the Sealed xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx (SPRC), is proposed. Besides providing a high integrity seal, the canister also incorporates features that for robotic manipulation and to allow the sample to be accessed in a controlled manner upon return to Earth. The SPRC seal system addresses the two most significant concerns for planetary samples -- seal surfaces contaminated by the sample and high pressure due to the phase change of volatiles. The SPRC incorporates a novel sealing system evolved from the only marginally successful xxxxxx seal approach but with added features to address the difficulties and inconsistencies observed. The indium is contained within a protective barrier to prevent oxidation, and the knife edge is mechanically cleaned during the sealing process. The container body will be configured to accommodate a variety of samples including rock cores, rock fragments, regolith, dust, and frozen soil. Atmospheric samples can also be preserved. The design is readily scalable and adaptable to specific missions.	13584

Bonissone CIDU Presentation: Design of Local Fuzzy Models	2010-09-10	2018-07-19	After reviewing key background concepts in fuzzy systems and evolutionary computing, we will focus on the use of local fuzzy models, which are related to both kernel regressions and locally weighted learning. Instead of using a manual approach to develop such models, we use evolutionary algorithms to search in the design space of these models.With these models we will determine the remaining life of a unit in a fleet of vehicles. Instead of developing individual models (based on the track history of each unit) or developing a global model (based on the collective track history of the fleet), we propose local fuzzy models based on clusters of peers, similar units with comparable utilization and performance. For each cluster of peers we create a local fuzzy model. We combine the fuzzy peer-based approach for performance modeling with an evolutionary framework for model maintenance. Our process generates a collection of competing models, evaluates their performance in light of the currently available data, refines the best models using evolutionary search, and selects the best one after a finite number of iterations. This process is repeated periodically to automatically produce updated and improved versions of the model.To illustrate this methodology we chose an asset selection problem: given a fleet of industrial vehicles (diesel electric locomotives), we want to select the best subset (of fixed or variable size) for mission-critical utilization. To this end, we predict the remaining life for each unit in the fleet. We then sort the fleet using this prediction and select the highest ranked units. The model chosen to perform this prediction/selection task is a fuzzy instance based model. A series of experiments using data from locomotive operations were conducted and the results from an initial validation exercise are presented.The approach of constructing local predictive models using fuzzy similarity with neighboring points along appropriate dimensions is not specific to any asset type, but it applies to many other Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) problems.	13589

Miniature space dosimeter based on semiconductor oxides, Phase I	2006-01-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx and Clemson xxxxxxersity have teamed for a miniature, ultra low power, space radiation dosimeter. We project this unit, \"xxxxxxRad\", to be 50X smaller than the existing solution. Our ability to capitalize on COTS semiconductor devices and processes enable extremely accurate measurements at low cost. xxxxxx xxxxxx. adds their space rad hard computing to provide data logging and reporting of radiation levels. Our innovation is to utilize a normally negative response of modern microelectronics to space radiation to enable measurement of impinging particles.

Selective Laser Ablation and Melting, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	In this project xxxxxxratech will develop a new additive manufacturing (AM) process called Selective xxxxxx Ablation and xxxxxxing (xxxxxx).  The key innovation in this project is the implementation of laser micromachining - guided by high resolution surface profilometry - as a subtractive method for making in-process corrections to traditional SLM builds.  Currently such an approach to hybrid AM has not been created, but will significantly advance the state-of-the-art for advanced metallic materials manufacturing.  The xxxxxx process will build a layer of a part by conventional SLM, immediately determine deviations from intended part tolerance - which may result either from normal limits of SLM resolution or errors in powder spreading - and then use the micromachining laser to correct those deviations before continuing to the next layer of the build.  Unlike other AM processes, xxxxxx will be able to produce micron-precision features and smooth surfaces on complex internal part structures that cannot be obtained by any other means. It will also produce high resolution external surface features and minimal roughness levels that will require little or no post-processing.  Finally, by elimination of small build errors in situ, before they can propagate into larger errors, it will greatly enhance reliability relative to traditional SLM methods and current hybrid AM methods, leading to higher part confidence, better process documentation (LLP data can be stored to inform digital thread records and digital twin models), and thus easier part certification.  A new AM process with these improvements has been identified an area of need for xxxxxx, where current processes struggle to produce validated, defect free parts in a reliable fashion.  By achieving these improvements xxxxxx will also reduce costs and lead-time.  xxxxxx possibilities are increased as well by enabling micro-AM components or internal features.	13593
Aerodynamic Efficiency Enhancements for Air Vehicles, Phase I	2006-01-01	2018-07-19	The need for aerodynamics-based efficiency enhancements for air vehicles is presented.

Using simulations, wind tunnel testing, and benchtop hardware development, the feasibility of the concepts will be established in xxxxxx In xxxxxx, flight testing will be performed to refine and finalize the designs. The concepts involve tailoring of the wing using adaptive surfaces to acheive drag reduction. This translates to benefits in range, endurance, manueuvering and speed characteristics of the air vehicle.	13594

The antenna design is optically transparent (i.e. will not compete for valuable surface real estate), modular, and is independent from the solar cells.	13595
Reservoir Cathode for Electric Space Propulsion, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	We propose a reservoir cathode to improve performance in both ion and xxxxxx-effect thrusters.  We propose to adapt our existing reservoir cathode technology to this purpose.  xxxxxx cathodes are the only emission sources that are capable of providing the necessary current density (>5.0 A/cm2) and life (>100,000 hours) for next generation high-power thrusters.  More powerful thrusters are needed for interplanetary and lunar missions, including earth escape and near-earth space maneuvers.  xxxxxx cathodes are able to provide sufficient new barium to the cathode surface to overcome the high barium removal rates in ion engines.  We have many years' experience developing reservoir cathodes.  The key challenge is the stresses exerted on the cathode tube due to differential expansion and large temperature excursions.  These lead to fracturing and weld failure.  Our innovation solves this problem. In xxxxxx I, a prototype is built and tested.  In xxxxxx, we optimize for specific ion engines.	13596
Validation of Autonomous Space Systems	2012-09-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx validation addresses the question \"Will the system do the right thing?\" When system capability includes autonomy, the question becomes more pointed. As xxxxxx deploys systems deeper into remote environments where the operating conditions are at least partly unknown, the ability to predict details of the operating context – a motivation for pursuing autonomy – becomes more challenging. This workshop will explore system validation concepts for future xxxxxx missions enabled by autonomy.xxxxxx validation addresses the question \"Will the system do the right thing?\" When system capability includes autonomy, or more specifically, onboard mission planning and possibly closed-loop control, the question becomes more pointed. As xxxxxx deploys space systems deeper into remote environments where the operating conditions are at least partly unknown (planetary surfaces, vicinity of primitive bodies), the ability to predict the fine details of the operating context becomes more challenging, and by extension, also the ability to predict how the system will behave under those operating conditions. On the other hand, grappling with operational uncertainty is in fact a motivation for pursuing onboard autonomy. The workshop will explore system validation in the context of future xxxxxx mission scenarios that are enabled by autonomy concepts. The workshop will address the following and related questions: • Are extant validation techniques and methodologies adequate or extensible to future mission scenarios and system autonomy concepts? • Is the concept of a system behavior envelope (an enforceable boundary on system behavior, independent of operating context) viable, both from an engineering safety and a mission success viewpoint? • Is it useful and perhaps necessary to view system validation as an activity that continues into operations (xxxxxx E)? The workshop will generate the following products: • An evaluation of whether future autonomous systems validation can be addressed by extensions to existing validation approaches or requires new validation concepts • A set of prioritized research questions relating to autonomous systems validation, and addressable with a small investment • A set of potential technology investments coupled to the research questions"	13597

Privacy Preserving Distributed Data Mining	2010-09-10	2018-07-19	Distributed data mining from privacy-sensitive multi-party data is likely to play an important role in the next generation of integrated vehicle health monitoring systems. For example, consider an airline manufacturer [tex]$\mathcal{C}$[/tex] manufacturing an aircraft model [tex]$A$[/tex] and selling it to five different airline operating companies [tex]$\mathcal{V}_1 \dots \mathcal{V}_5$[/tex]. These aircrafts, during their operation, generate huge amount of data. Mining this data can reveal useful information regarding the health and operability of the aircraft which can be useful for disaster management and prediction of efficient operating regimes. Now if the manufacturer [tex]$\mathcal{C}$[/tex] wants to analyze the performance data collected from different aircrafts of model-type [tex]$A$[/tex] belonging to different airlines then central collection of data for subsequent analysis may not be an option. It should be noted that the result of this analysis may be statistically more significant if the data for aircraft model [tex]$A$[/tex] across all companies were available to [tex]$\mathcal{C}$[/tex]. The potential problems arising out of such a data mining scenario are:	13599
The Automated X-Link for Orbital Networking (AXON) Connector, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx has identified the need for a joining technologies to support the ability to connect spacecraft components autonomously in-space. The joining technology should be modular, reversible, have an open-architecture, and allow \"plug-and-play\" functionality for maximum flexibility and utilize simple approaches amenable to robotic assembly and disassembly. TUI has been working on structural truss joining (Class 1 joints) and robotic connection approaches through separate efforts and has several ongoing and future efforts that will require in-space joining of modular systems (Class 2 joints).TUI proposes to develop and demonstrate an open-architecture Class 2 joining solution called the Automated X-Linked for xxxxxx xxxxxx (AXON) connector. The AXON connector will be a reversible module-to-module connector that minimizes mass and complexity while maximizing assembled stiffness, strength, power transfer, and data communications. The development of the AXON connector will leverage TUI's existing programs and place emphasize automated robotic mating and de-mating.In the xxxxxx I effort, we will identify a complete set of requirements, develop a concept design, fabricate the concept using TUI's 3D printing and rapid prototyping capabilities, and test the AXON connector using TUI's Baxter robot. In the xxxxxx effort, TUI will mature the xxxxxx I design and perform reliability testing."	13600
Hybrid-Electric and All-Electric Rotorcraft Analysis and Tool Development, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	During this xxxxxx I effort ESAero will draw upon its knowledge of hybrid-electric propulsion system design and analysis for fixed wing aircraft to investigate the potential benefits of incorporating such systems into rotorcraft designs. Past rotorcraft studies have been conducted in conjunction with Electricore, xxxxxx. and an industry prime, to develop hybrid propulsion system trade studies and develop databases for hybrid propulsion system worthy components. This knowledge will be leveraged to investigate potential areas of improvement including energy consumption, weight, overall efficiency, and safety. Implementing hybrid-electric systems could potentially remove redundant systems, reduce turbine size and allow for electrically powered emergency decent. In addition, decoupled energy management has shown potential benefits for fixed wing aircraft, allowing propulsors to be placed virtually anywhere around the aircraft. The potential benefit specific to rotorcraft may mean a broadening of configuration possibilities.	13601

E VA Space Suit Power, Avionics, and Software Systems, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx is interested in a reliable, robust, and low xxxxxx and xxxxxx (SWAP) input device that will allow for EVA astronauts to navigate display menu systems. The resulting input device should provide mouse-like functionality and need minimal hand use. xxxxxx proposes a solution that does not require any hand or glove control. Instead, we propose an input device that uses purposes eye-blinks, eye motions, and limited vocal commands for display menu navigation.Our reasoning is that the astronaut, especially on EVA, needs a method of accessing display menus in a minimally intrusive way. Their hands are usually occupied, and so using them for mouse-like gestures is impractical. Taking a cue from xxxxxx, and based on our previously developed eye tracking system and voice interaction system developed separately for xxxxxx, we are confident we can create a system that takes purposes eye blinks and motions that allows the astronaut to navigate display menus without interfering with other work. Specifically, during the xxxxxx I we will create a feasibility demonstration that does the following: eye gaze, purposive eye blinks, and limited vocabulary voice commands. The combination of the above three input methods should be relatively easy to learn and use (i.e. minimal practice) and should not interfere with normal EVA operations. What is needed, though, is a small camera/microphone that is located within the astronaut's helmet that continually has a view of one or both of the astronaut's eyes. During the xxxxxx I we will implement a feasibility proof of the above input methods and research appropriate hardware. During the xxxxxx we will acquire hardware similar for a full prototype system that will enable us to demonstrate low SWAP, as well as measure accuracy and utility.	13603
Gene expression profiles of irradiated lung tissue in three mouse strains	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	The aim of our research is to clarify the mechanisms generating heterogeneity in response to C-ion irradiation that arise from individual genetic variations in humans. In this study we performed whole lung C-ion irradiation using three different strains of mice to examine whether strain-dependent differences in radiation effects occur in high-LET C-ion thoracic irradiation. xxxxxx strain-variance was evaluated by histopathological examination of intra-alveolar hemorrhage that is likely to occur during the early phase after irradiation and of lung fibrosis during the late phase occurring more than three months after irradiation. We also performed microarray analysis to identify the key genes that are differentially regulated in different mouse strains after C-ion irradiation and to determine the mechanism of strain-dependent pulmonary damage after high-LET C-ion irradiation. Eight-week old female inbred C3H/He Slc C57BL/6J Jms Slc and A/J Jms Slc mice (3 kinds of mice) were used. The whole thorax of three mice was locally irradiated at 10 Gy with C-ion beams with a reference beam 137Cs gamma-rays (2 kinds of beam). Three mice of each strain (3 mice) were sacrificed and immediately dissected for lung extraction at 6 h (6h sample). Lungs for three mice of each strain without irradiation were extracted at the same time as control samples (control sample). Hybridization to microarrays (xxxxxx Genome 4x44K Oligoxxxxxx xxxxxx single color xxxxxx) consisting of 44,000 total spots was conducted using an Agilent xxxxxx Expression hybridization kit. The arrays from three independent replicates for each sample (3 arrays) were scanned on an Agilent dual-laser xxxxxx (all from Agilent Technologies) following the manufacturer  s instructions. A total of 108 samples were analyzed. 3 replicate arrays x 3 mice x 3 strains x 2 timing for sampling x 2 kinds of beam.	13604
Mobility in the Small Body Environment: Close Proximity Landing and Surface Dynamics	2020-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxreasingly over the past decade, scientific interest in asteroids and comets has led to the development of mission architectures for both robotic and crewed missions to explore these small primordial bodies. Such exploration helps scientists trace the history and evolution of the solar system and possibly the origin of life on Earth. Furthering xxxxxx mission to extend human presence into the solar system, missions investigating near Earth asteroids enable exploration of deep space and are also a stepping stone to longer, more extensive missions to xxxxxx and other planetary bodies. xxxxxx, missions to small bodies have been fly-by trajectories, but recent missions have increasingly attempted to interact with the target body. xxxxxxver, previous failures such as the inability of the MINERVA mini-lander to land on Itokawa illustrates that proximity operations about small bodies remains non-trivial. This motivates the development of technological capabilities needed for small body in situ exploration, sample acquisition, and crewed operations, which could be utilized by future missions such as OSIRIS-REx and the Asteroid Redirect Mission. Proposed is the development of models and tools to characterize and utilize the small body environment for close proximity landing and surface operations. First a model of the strength and stability of small body surfaces will be examined. Understanding how the asteroid particle sizes, compositions, and electrical properties combine to form the asteroid's internal strength is necessary to determine how best to interact with the surface. For instance, if an asteroid is only weakly held together, landing on or anchoring to the surface may not be a viable option. This knowledge will in turn affect what types of tools are developed for future crewed and robotic missions of exploration. Next a model of the electrostatic charging process for small bodies will be developed. The surface of asteroids may be very dusty, making the effect of charged dust on spacecraft significant. Understanding and quantifying how asteroids and comets charge needs to be modeled and tested. Asteroid geometries are diverse and unique and are further complicated through material characteristics and non-uniform distribution of conducting and insulating properties. Next, the interaction between the small body environment and spacecraft will be characterized and modeled. This is key to accounting for all the relevant forces and torques acting on the spacecraft when implementing controlled maneuvers. Effects such as the charge of levitating dust particles around the asteroid, in addition to the varying gravitational field around the asteroid, will affect the motion of the spacecraft over time. Finally, sensing and control methods will be implemented. xxxxxxing methods and technologies to determine (and potentially directly measure) the strength, stability, and electrical properties of asteroids in real-time will enable spacecraft to more effectively interact with the surface. Taking these measurements and implementing unique controls for the specific environment is a key area of research and will provide insight into how the properties of a small body can be manipulated to improve mission capabilities. It is critical for future space missions to understand and utilize the space environment around small bodies to extend mission capability and extensibility. Understanding this environment (through modeling and observation) and utilizing this knowledge for maneuverability around and on the asteroid's surface provides versatile control authority for a variety of mission phases ranging from robust orbital maneuvers, approach and landing, new sample return techniques, and overall mission architecture plans. The proposed research explores the synergy of physics and engineering to both better understand and utilize the space environment around small bodies to enhance exploration by both robotic and crewed missions.	13605
Improved Rhenium Thrust Chambers for In-Space Propulsion, Phase II	2018-04-01	2018-07-19	Radiation-cooled, bipropellant thrust chambers are being considered for the ascent/descent engines and reaction control systems for xxxxxx missions such as xxxxxx and xxxxxxn xxxxxxV.  Currently, iridium-lined rhenium combustion chambers are the state-of-the-art for in-space engines. xxxxxx xxxxxxanced Materials Bipropellant xxxxxx (AMBR) engine, a xxxxxx iridium-rhenium chamber produced by xxxxxx and xxxxxx, recently set a hydrazine specific impulse record of 333.5 seconds.  To withstand the high loads during terrestrial launch, rhenium chambers with improved mechanical properties are needed.  Recent EL-FormTM results have shown considerable promise for improving the mechanical properties of rhenium by producing a multi-layered deposit comprised of a tailored microstructure, i.e., xxxxxx. During xxxxxx I, an AMBR size chamber was produced to demonstrate formation of the xxxxxx material in both the throat and barrel regions.  Tensile tests showed the xxxxxx  material had a yield strength greater than 40ksi at room temperature.  In addition, xxxxxx deposits were produced on multiple mandrels at one time, i.e., multi-component process demonstration.  During xxxxxx, the xxxxxx processing techniques will be optimized. xxxxxx characterization and mechanical properties test will be performed.  xxxxxximization of the multi-component fabrication technique will result in a 30% or higher reduction in chamber fabrication costs.  The most promising techniques will be selected and used to produce an xxxxxx AMBR size combustion chamber for testing at xxxxxx.	13606
Compact isotope analysis system for in-situ biosignature investigation, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop a sensor for in-situ stable isotope analysis from a lander/rover on future planetary missions.  The system will enable the collection of valuable information applicable to biosignature investigations, i.e., the search for evidence of life within the solar system.  Current limitations to in-situ isotope measurements will be overcome by utilizing a hollow fiber optic based IR spectroscopy concept.  This concept enables high precision measurements within the ultra-small sample volume (<<1ml) of the hollow fiber and has proven to be three orders of magnitude more sensitive in terms of required sample size than current state of the art isotope sensors.  The proposed project will focus on transitioning the current lab-based technique to a small size, weight, and power (SWaP) device that can be operated unattended.  Significant strides will be made in this direction through the use of optimized hollow fiber technology developed at OKSI.  In xxxxxx I, proposed concepts for improving the system performance, reducing the SWaP, and engineering a field-capable device will be proven and specific options down selected for full development in xxxxxx.  A complete prototype will be produced to measure xxxxxx (C) and xxxxxx (S) isotope ratios from solid rock samples in xxxxxx.  The ability to generate simultaneous C and S isotope measurements from solid samples has great potential for assessing biosignatures relating to sulfate reducing organisms and organisms using simple C substrates (including methanogens, fermenters, and others).  The sensitivity afforded by the proposed system would open up this capability to smaller samples than ever before measured as well as provide a potential device for remote deployment.  This could be a significant development in the search for these biosignatures on other planets and near space objects as well as in the early Earth rock record.	13607

Cost Reduction of IMM Solar Cells by Recycling Substrates using Wet Chemical Etching, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	This program focuses on reducing the cost of substrate reclaim for high-efficiency solar cells fabricated via an epitaxial lift-off (ELO) process, while increasing the number of reuse cycles possible for a given substrate.  We will introduce a new multi-layer etch-stop structure into inverted metamorphic (IMM) triple-junction solar cells grown on 100-mm xxxxxx substrates.  The etch-stop structure will be grown between the original xxxxxx substrate and the ELO release layer, thereby becoming the effective substrate surface after the ELO process.  The purpose of the etch-stop structure is to prevent pits and surface damage incurred during ELO from damaging the original xxxxxx surface.  The standard method of reclaiming the xxxxxx substrate after ELO is to employ chemo-mechanical polishing (CMP) to remove the defect-ridden xxxxxx surface and chemically polish the underlying xxxxxx to a yield surface that is suitable for successive epitaxial growth.  This process works effectively but reduces resultant substrate thickness and causes some wafer damage itself, which then requires further polishing.  These factors accumulate over time, practically limiting the number of reclaim cycles to 5&#150;10 for a given substrate.  With the incorporation of the proposed multi-layer etch-stop structure, the defects are isolated in the etch-stop structure, which can be dissolved by successive selective wet chemical etches to produce the original pristine xxxxxx surface with its original thickness.  All mechanical polishing is eliminated in this proposed work, ensuring a constant substrate thickness through repeated substrate reclaim cycles and also drastically reducing the estimated cost of the recycling process to <$1 per substrate.	13609
Laser-Directed CVD 3D Printing System for Refractory Metal Propulsion Hardware, Phase II, Phase II	2018-01-01	2018-07-19	In this work, xxxxxx is developing a three-dimensional (3D) laser-directed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) additive manufacturing system to build free-form refractory metal components for liquid rocket propulsion systems. By combining xxxxxx's experience in refractory metal fabrication by CVD with computer control of directed laser energy, nearly unlimited expression of part shape and metal composition can be realized for component fabrication. 3D additive manufacturing is revolutionizing many industries by offering unconstrained complex build geometries and reduced cost, lead time, and material usage compared with conventional manufacturing techniques. By developing laser-directed CVD technology for refractory metals, xxxxxx will bring these inherent benefits to a class of materials that are notoriously difficult to form and thus are expensive to implement. By depositing successive layers of metal directly from reactive precursor gases, the system will be able to build components from rhenium, tungsten, tantalum, niobium, and their alloys with complex internal features and reduced assembly part count. In xxxxxx I, xxxxxx designed and built a laser-directed CVD reactor, successfully deposited both rhenium and tungsten in a controlled fashion, and achieved well-defined two-dimensional spatial control and layering as a strong demonstration of process feasibility. In xxxxxx, xxxxxx will design and build a new high-power, high-speed reactor with optical z-axis control to enable layering for 3D geometries at high deposition rates. Software and hardware integration will provide automated layering control to enable fully automatic additive manufacturing from 3D models. The deposited rhenium and its layering will be characterized and optimized by direct printing of mechanical test specimens and small demonstrator articles. This phase of the research will mature the system and technology to a level where automated fabrication of small 3D components is possible.	13610
Adaptable Single Active Loop Thermal Control System (TCS) for Future Space Missions	2016-01-01	2018-07-19	The primary objectives of this study are to develop (1) a fundamental understanding of two-phase transport phenomena and (2) design concepts for a thermal control system (TCS) for future space missions. The proposed system architecture will enable the TCS to be reconfigured during the various mission phases to respond, not only to varying heat load, but to heat rejection temperature as well.	13611
Aerogel-Filled Foam Core Insulation for Cryogenic Propellant Storage, Phase II	2014-06-01	2018-07-19	Current cryogenic insulation materials suffer from various drawbacks including high cost and weight, lack of structural or load-bearing capability, fabrication complexity, and property anisotropy. A need clearly exists for lightweight thermal insulation that is isotropic and structurally capable with high thermal performance, while also offering reduced fabrication and installation complexity and lower cost. In previous work for xxxxxx and DoD involving lightweight structural insulation for high temperature engine and airframe applications, xxxxxx developed and demonstrated lightweight open-cell foam insulators composed of a carbon or ceramic structural foam skeleton filled with a low-cost, nanoscale aerogel insulator. The potential exists to adapt and optimize aerogel-filled structural foam for the cryogenic insulation application, taking advantage of the thermal and mechanical benefits of each component while offering low cost and manufacturability in complex shapes. In xxxxxx I, the feasibility of fabricating aerogel-filled open-cell foam for cryogenic application was demonstrated, initial thermal performance was established, and a path for continued material and structural optimization was developed through design and modeling. In xxxxxx, xxxxxx will again team with Ocellus, a leader in low-cost aerogel fabrication, and Materials xxxxxxearch and Design for design and analysis support. Thermal performance will be characterized at the xxxxxxgenics Test xxxxxx at xxxxxx.	13612
Shielded Mars Balloon Launcher (SMBL), Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxs, along with its partner Vertigo Industries, proposes a novel approach to deployment of balloon-based payloads into the xxxxxx atmosphere. xxxxxxoon-based xxxxxx exploration has the capability to cover a larger portion of the xxxxxx surface than is accessible via a rover and to provide better resolution than is available from satellites. Due to the low density of the xxxxxx atmosphere, the balloon envelope for even a small payload is quite large (tens of meters in diameter); therefore, balloon deployment is a major challenge for a xxxxxx balloon.  A ground launched balloon, as compared to descent launched, allows a longer time constant for deployment, more control over the timing of the deployment, and, if coupled with a rover, also allows more control over the location of deployment. A challenge to ground deployment is the possibility of the envelope being damaged during deployment by winds, surrounding rocks, or parts of the associated lander.  xxxxxx's Shielded xxxxxx xxxxxxoon Launcher (SMBL) concept addresses this challenge by using inflatable structures to provide a safe environment for balloon inflation and deployment. The proposed SMBL system has a 15 kg mass and packed volume of 0.15 m^3, and is therefore feasible as a secondary payload on existing xxxxxx exploration missions.	13613

Next Generation Life Support (NGLS): Continuous Electrochemical Gas Separator	2016-08-01	2018-07-19	The purpose of this&nbsp;technology development task&nbsp;is to develop a new air purification system based on a liquid membrane, capable of purifying carbon dioxide from air in a far more compact and energy efficient system than what is currently possible. The approach relies on recent advances in supported liquid membranes, which allow&nbsp;the manufacture of&nbsp;mechanically stable, ultra-thin supported liquids that have permeability and selectivity for carbon dioxide over one order of magnitude greater than existing approaches. Most critically, because these membranes use a liquid as an active material, it is possible to electrochemically pump the carbon dioxide, making it viable to build an air purification system that uses no mechanical components such as compressors. Such an innovation has the potential to dramatically improve xxxxxx&#39;s capabilities for&nbsp;human missions to xxxxxx and other long-term space habitation applications. Life support systems on human&nbsp;spacecraft are designed to provide a safe, habitable environment for the astronauts, and one of the most significant challenges is managing acceptable air quality. xxxxxx dioxide (xxxxxx) is an important trace gas produced by human metabolism that must be actively removed from spacecraft cabin atmosphere. The xxxxxx Removal Assembly (CDRA) currently on board the xxxxxx performs the carbon dioxide (xxxxxx) removal function as part of the on-board Atmosphere Revitalization xxxxxx (ARS). It is considered the state-of-the-art for manned spacecraft cabins, but has two significant drawbacks: 1. The CDRA requires that air be dried prior to xxxxxx capture, and this costs energy &ndash; in fact, the system uses much energy drying the air than is&nbsp;required for&nbsp;capturing and releasing carbon dioxide. 2. The CDRA works in batch mode, requiring complicated valving and control to switch between sorbing and desorbing beds, while downstream xxxxxx processing systems can operate on a continuous stream of xxxxxx. This adds unnecessary complexity, as well as a second parasitic energy loss. An ideal system would process xxxxxx continuously without any need for drying of the air, and without any moving parts. Such a system would require a fraction of the size and weight of the CDRA while dropping the cost of xxxxxx capture by 5X or more. Such a technology would be enabling for future long term manned flight missions, such as a mission to xxxxxx. This element is developing a new electrochemical membrane technology using patented innovations in electrolyte materials. xxxxxx development began under a xxxxxx I effort funded by the xxxxxx xxxxxxanced xxxxxxovative Concepts Program. The prior xxxxxx I effort&nbsp;demonstrated the functionality of the basic approach to xxxxxx separation, demonstrating xxxxxx&nbsp;removal using&nbsp;only electrical input using&nbsp;a film in a membrane configuration. xxxxxx synthesis and fabrication techniques were developed that allowed for the successful incorporation and retention of an electrochemically active carrier molecule&nbsp;using composite liquid membrane technology. This allowed for the successful demonstration of a continuous xxxxxx capture rate at 40% in a single step with no moving parts. A higher capture rate of 80% was demonstrated in a batch mode during this phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;The work gave promise that highly efficient, low energy separation of xxxxxx&nbsp;was possible using this technology, with&nbsp;the potential&nbsp;of operational energy savings as high as 80%&nbsp;compared with the state of the art, together with a weight and size footprint that could be as much as 75% smaller.

An Interactive Visual Analytics Tool for NASA's General Mission Analysis Tool, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The goal of any spacecraft trajectory design process is to identify a path that transfers a vehicle from its point of origin to some specific destination in the presence of path and mission level constraints. From the mission designer perspective, this process is divided into two primary tasks: (a) the identification of candidate startup arcs, and (b) the subsequent refinement of those solutions, via targeting or optimization processes, to meet some pre-defined mission requirements. The work proposed here seeks to address the first aspect directly, while addressing the second indirectly, using xxxxxx xxxxxxral Mission xxxxxx Tool (xxxxxx) as the underlying demonstration platform. xxxxxx I of this effort is focused on developing a prototype for an xxxxxx xxxxxx Analytics Tool (IVAT) for xxxxxx. The goal of the IVAT module is to provide a modern, interactive, preliminary design tool that allows analysts to more efficiently explore and mine the space of candidate solutions prior to selecting a specific mission for the refinement phase.

A SMART NAS Toolkit for Optimality Metrics Overlay, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	"The innovation proposed is a plug-and-play module for xxxxxx proposed SMART NAS (Shadow Mode Assessment using Realistic Technologies for the NAS) system that computes and displays metrics related to how close to optimal a simulated scenario is performing under various system objectives in a multi-objective setting.  The module, called xxxxxx (Toolkit for xxxxxximization Metrics Overlay) is a large-scale optimization model that computes trajectories of aircraft under xxxxxx xxxxxx Operations (TBO) that optimize system performance under various objectives such as delays, fuel burn, and environmental impacts.  The toolkit is designed to be used either in shadow mode or in post-operations analysis.  This capability within SMART NAS would allow a scenario's performance to be normalized against an achievable best case and will facilitate a meaningful comparison of the performance of scenarios with different types of demand, weather, and operating constraints.  xxxxxx will also feature a \"simultaneous playback\" mode, in which a user can simultaneously compare the simulated scenario with an optimized version for each potential objective.xxxxxx is based on a new class of algorithms for solving large-scale TFM problems by separating TFM optimization into two problems---a master problem that checks for capacity violations and allocates resources to competing aircraft, and a sub-problem solved by each individual aircraft that generates 4-d trajectories for each flight. The master problem exchanges dual prices that signal congestion across ATC resources to guide the sub-problems to an optimal solution.  This \"agent-based\" optimization approach is well-suited to be used within a large-scale agent-based simulation framework."	13626
High-Performance Contaminant Monitor for Spacecraft, Phase II	2007-12-01	2018-07-19	The Vision for xxxxxx Exploration demands increasing reliance on real-time trace gas monitors onboard spacecraft.  Present grab samples and badges will be inadequate beyond low-xxxxxxorbit.  xxxxxx better monitors will be critical components for early detection of fire, release event monitoring, crew habitability, and air revitalization processes.  The danger from fire and toxic releases aboard spacecraft is constant with only moments for detection and contravention.  xxxxxx are unique high-value systems where failure is measured in lives, dollars, time, and public perception.  xxxxxx crews have little chance of escaping vessels that cannot continue to support life.  It is imperative to detect danger in these closed-cycle environments at the earliest possible moment.  Present fire detectors onboard spacecraft are inadequate due to fatigue, sensitivity or time response.  Smoke detectors are insufficient for detecting the earliest stages of combustion.  Further, smoke detectors will become increasingly unreliable due to false alarms upon exposure to dust particulates from the xxxxxx and xxxxxx.  xxxxxxs are needed to directly detect the molecular products of combustion.  Vista Photonics proposes to develop rugged, compact prototype optical fire detection and contaminant monitoring instrumentation capable of selectively measuring a critical suite of contaminants at parts-per-million (ppm) or better sensitivities in a few seconds.	13627
Transcriptional and proteomic response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to spaceflight conditions involves Hfq regulation and reveals a role for oxygen	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	Characterization of bacterial behavior in the microgravity environment of spaceflight is of importance towards risk assessment and prevention of infectious disease during long-term missions. Further this research field unveils new insights into connections between low fluid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process in vivo and bacterial virulence. This study is the first to characterize the global transcriptomic and proteomic response of an opportunistic pathogen that is actually found in the space habitat xxxxxx aeruginosa. Overall P. aeruginosa responded to spaceflight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins with xxxxxx identified as a global transcriptional regulator in the response to this environment. Since xxxxxx was also induced in spaceflight-grown xxxxxx typhimurium xxxxxx represents the first spaceflight-induced regulator across the bacterial species border. The major P. aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceflight conditions were the lecA and xxxxxx lectins and the rhamnosyltransferase (rhlA) involved in the production of rhamnolipids. The transcriptional response of spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data of this organism grown in microgravity-analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology. Interesting similarities were observed among others with regard to xxxxxx regulation and oxygen utilization. While xxxxxx-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic metabolism P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceflight adopted an anaerobic mode of growth in which denitrification was presumably most prominent. Differences in hardware between spaceflight and xxxxxx experiments in combination with more pronounced low fluid shear and mixing in spaceflight when compared to xxxxxx conditions were hypothesized to be at the origin of these observations. Collectively our data suggest that spaceflight conditions could induce the transition of P. aeruginosa from an opportunistic organism to potential pathogen results that are of importance for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention both during spaceflight missions and in the clinic. This study describes the transcriptional response of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to low-Earth orbit environmental conditions. Our aim was to assess whether the microgravity environment of spaceflight could induce virulence traits in P. aeruginosa. To this end P. aeruginosa cultures were grown in space and the expression profile was compared with ground control samples (both in biological triplicate). Two RWV samples also examined (did not re-analyze them only compared the outputs).	13628
Multi-kW Uplink Fiber-Laser Beacon with Agile Signal Format, Phase II	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	&#61557;xxxxxx beacons with scalable powers are needed for ground to  deep-space optical communication uplinks. They serve as absolute reference for tracking of spacecraft during the downlink laser communication.  For such space communication link distances the beam spread due to diffraction is significant enough that only few photons are collected by a moderate size optical telescopes on the spacecraft. This necessitates photon-counting detectors suited for the space environment, along with increasing the output power of the laser beacon. xxxxxx low noise silicon avalanche photo-detector (Si-APD) based position-sensing detectors are used on the spacecraft to detect the laser beacons. Such xxxxxx are also radiation-hardened and compatible with space-environment operation. It is therefore desirable to operate at shorter wavelengths xxxxxx0nm, where xxxxxx have improved spectral responsivity. This helps to improve the SNR for tracking, and consequently reduce the uplink laser power requirements. Under xxxxxx 2 program xxxxxx will design and build a single-channel uplink laser beacon transmitter operating at 1030nm, capable of 500W average output power and 500kHz 16-PPM ary format operation. xxxxxx from end-user will be solicited for intended use and application, so as to drive the design requirements.  xxxxxx multi-stage 1024nm nm xxxxxx amplifier architecture demonstrated in xxxxxx will be transitioned to highly robust 'all-fiber' configuration.  Proposed design and prototype hardware is based on COTS fiber-optic technology platform, thereby leading to xxxxxx = 4 &#150; 5 level for the xxxxxx xxxxxx 2 deliverable.	13629

Distributed Data Mining for Aircraft Health Management, Phase II	2014-04-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxx Operations xxxxxx (FOQA) programs are implemented by most of the aircraft operators. Vast amounts of FOQA data are distributed between many computers, organizations, and geographic locations. This project develops methodology for transforming such distributed data into actionable knowledge in application to aircraft health management from the vehicle level to the fleet level to the national level. The distributed data processing methodology provably obtains the same results as would be obtained if the data could be centralized. The data mining methods are efficient and scalable so that they can return results quickly for 10Tb of distributed data.This data mining technology that we call Distributed Fleet xxxxxx (DFM) developed in xxxxxx xxxxxx I satisfies these requirements. The data are transformed into models, trends, and anomalies. The model training and anomaly monitoring are formulated as convex optimization and decision problems. The optimization agents are distributed over networked computers and are integrated through remote connection interface in a scalable open grid computing framework. Though the data and the computations are distributed, they yield provably the same optimal solution that would be obtained by a centralized optimization.DFM feasibility was demonstrated in the problem of monitoring aircraft flight performance from fleet data using large realistic simulated datasets. We demonstrated efficient computation of quadratic optimal solution by interacting distributed agents. The feasibility demonstration successfully recovered aircraft performance anomalies that are well below the level of the natural variation in the data and are not directly visible. The algorithms are very efficient and scalable. xxxxxx I demonstration extrapolates to processing 10Tb of raw FOQA data in under an hour to detect anomalous units, abnormal flights, and compute predictive trends.	13634

Sufficient compliance of the developed sound level meter and noise dosimeter with the related ANSI standards will be tested and demonstrated. Thisplan takes advantage of our broad knowledge in acoustic signal processing and ZigBee wireless sensor network, and will benefit from our experience and skills with the development of embedded digital signal processing systems using either FPGA (field programmable gate array) or DSP (digital signal processor). The xxxxxx I effort will provide a foundation for prototype design to be conducted in xxxxxx.	13635
Monitoring Electron Beam Freeform Fabrication by Active Machine Vision, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	Additive manufacturing is a modern fabrication process by which three dimensional components are built up layer-by-layer.

During xxxxxx I, xxxxxxSonic demonstrated the feasibility of using its patented Metal RubberTM sheet and fabric materials as both sensor elements and highly flexible electrodes integrated into prototype instrumented garments.  Heart rate and EKG data taken using the Metal RubberTM sensors are essentially identical to those obtained using standard biomedical instrumentation.  The combined high electrical conductivity, low mechanical modulus, and environmental robustness of the Metal RubberTM materials make them a lightweight, stretchy and comfortable alternative to conventional metal wiring and cabling.  During the proposed xxxxxx program, xxxxxxSonic would work with a large-volume xxxxxx textile manufacturer, the sensor and electronics design group of a major aerospace company, and a biomedical sensor and devices laboratory of Food and Drug Administration.  xxxxxxSonic would improve the Metal RubberTM materials and methods for their integration as sensor and interconnect materials into instrumented garments, design, fabricate and evaluate the performance of sensor jerseys based on the results of xxxxxx I tests, develop data acquisition electronics needed to interface to standard storage and communication modules, and investigate requirements for scaled-up manufacturing.	13637

Advanced Cookware and Techniques for Food Preparation at Reduced Pressure and Gravity, Phase II	2014-06-01	2018-07-19	Makel xxxxxxing and Cornell xxxxxxersity propose to develop a galley architecture taking into account the design constraints of the space habitat, such as reduced pressure and gravity, minimize size, mass, power and crew time, while producing food with high nutritional value and enough variety, acceptable taste and texture qualities for long term crew consumption. The current design of the space habitat will have a reduced atmospheric pressure of 8 psia which is equivalent to a 16,000 foot mountain top, with oxygen enrichment to prevent hypoxia effects on the crew.  The combination of reduced pressure and gravity will affect the heat and mass transfer during food processing and food preparation of the food.  Whether the food system is based chiefly on bulk packaged ingredients or crops grown on site, it must minimize mass, volume, power and waste, make effective use of the limited resource of crew time, produce nutritious, highly acceptable and varied food, and integrate into the closed habitat's atmospheric control system by containing and controlling airborne particulates, water vapor and odors generated during food preparation.	13643

Metamaterials-Inspired Aerospace Structures (MIAS), Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	"The vibroacoustic characteristics of structures are vital in determining the operational envelope and mission feasibilities. The sources of vibroacoustic excitation are mainly due to noise generated by the launcher during ignition, lift-off, and atmospheric flight.  Typically, foam or fiberglass claddings and cores or acoustic liners which incorporate resonating chambers are used to prevent the transmission of sound through such structural locations. xxxxxxver, this approach is found to be ineffective for vibroacoustic sources with dominant frequency content below 400 Hz.  It is proposed to develop a metamaterial-inspired composite structure incorporating low-frequency vibro-impact resonating elements coupled with conventional high-frequency acoustic absorbers. The idea is to employ structurally-integral tuned resonators to pick up energy from incident low-frequency sound waves and utilizing the mechanism of frequency up-conversion via impacts, transfer the energy to higher modes in the sandwich primary structure for subsequent dissipation with conventional acoustic absorbers. The advantage of the proposed structure would be in reducing the transmitted pressure of low frequency waves, for which conventional methods are ineffective.  Our initial bound for the attachment mass is within 5 to 10% of the baseline structure to show significant peak pressure reduction for LF waves. The state-of-the-art conventional absorbers provide about 10-20% sound transmission loss (STL) in the 100-150 Hz range. Our performance objective is to achieve STL of about 50-60% in frequency range below 400 Hz with 5-10% mass increase without deteriorating stiffness response of the structure. Successful completion of xxxxxx I work will result in a \"proof-of-concept\" MIAS unit cell. In xxxxxx, detailed design and fabrication of the MIAS prototype panel will be completed."	13645
Striction-based Power Monitoring in Space Environment, Phase II	2017-08-01	2018-07-19	The program delivers a completely new technology solution to isolation and sensing of power flow (current and voltage).  xxxxxx on striction materials technology, these small isolation and sensing devices replace xxxxxxo-isolation, xxxxxx-effect and xxxxxxic Transformer isolation and sensing with a lower cost and lower risk solution.  The elimination of optical, processor and magnetic components in the design means that these devices are inherently both rad hard and EMI immune.  The technology provides superior voltage isolation (ground loop elimination) in a smaller package size.  They also will be capable of reliably operating over significantly wider temperature ranges  (-55C to 200C) than is readily available to most xxxxxx missions.	13646
Intelligent Information Processing for Enhanced Safety in the NAS, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	We propose a system that focuses on how improved information flow between agents acting in a flight deck environment can improve safety performance. Agents are defined as either human, computational, or hardware that can act on information.  Information that can flow to an agent is filtered based on priority.  This protects human agents from information glut and information overload and reduces bandwidth requirements on communications channels.  Agents react to the presented information by accepting it, discounting it, or querying the system for more information.  All decisions and actions are recorded and modeled by the system in order to verify correct and efficient processing of information.The proposed system will operate independently of flight deck systems but will have access to required information sources.  It will not impose an additional monitoring responsibility on the flight crew except for when safety issues surface.  At that point, the flight crew's attention is captured and then predefined, prioritized information is presented in a selected format.The proposed system consists of the major software components: the xxxxxx Workbench, the Condition Monitor, and the Notification Terminal.  The xxxxxx Workbench is used to identify all agents, roles, conditions of interest which trigger information flows, and information with associated context and priority.  The notification mechanism, the information flow's destination, and the format for reporting information along with justification is also defined by the workbench.  Condition monitors serve as the interface between information-producing systems and notification terminals.  Conditions of interest along with all information metadata are deployed to the condition monitors.  The notification terminal receives prioritized information and presents the information in the predefined format.	13647
Thin-film Hybrid Coating for Ice Mitigation on Aircraft, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	Current aircraft utilize electro-thermal/mechanical protection systems to actively remove ice from vital aircraft surfaces. These systems have high power requirements and only protect certain areas of the aircraft; thus such technology is not considered for next generation vehicles as it will greatly diminish the allocation of power for other vital components. The accumulation of ice on an aircraft (airframe or engine components) results in a drastic decrease of performance (decrease in thrust and lift, increase in weight and drag). To this effect, Materials xxxxxxfication, xxxxxx. (MMI), proposes to develop a thin-film coating that will combat dynamic icing conditions with a two-part solution; in which the top layer coating consists of a smooth superhydrophobic coating to combat the supercooled water droplets and a base layer that consists of a smooth silicone elastomer to reduce ice adhesion strength from possible ice nucleation. xxxxxx I efforts will be primarily dedicated towards developing and synthesizing the hybrid thin-film coating and evaluating its ice adhesion strength, coating durability, and surface morphology. xxxxxx efforts will build upon the results of the xxxxxx I findings and incorporate the material/coating into xxxxxx constructed vehicles such as UAVs, manned aircrafts, and next generation aerial vehicles (N+2).	13648

Attitude Control Enhancement Using Distributed Wing Load Sensing for Dynamic Servoelastic Control, Phase II	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx sensor information is used in nature to achieve robust flight, good rejection of wind disturbances, and stable head motion. Similar man-made sensing devices will be used to demonstrate flight control using Fly-by-Feel, with the overall objective of achieving similarly good performance with piloted and autonomous vehicles. The xxxxxx I work demonstrated the feasibility of using strain sensor arrays for flight control applications. This was done using hardware testing on a wing in a laboratory setting. An important part of showing feasibility was the use of novel frequency domain identification techniques, which were used to identify both modal frequencies and strain mode shapes. The proposed work will develop the ACES system: Attitude Control Enhancement using xxxxxx sensors using both wind tunnel and flight test demonstrations. Acceleration feedback is known to improve the gust disturbance rejection, and the same will be demonstrated in an active control experiment using strain sensors in a wind tunnel. A second experiment will be conducted using a different and more flexible wing to demonstrate active control of shape. xxxxxx and simulation will be used to begin the transition of this technology to larger commercial vehicles.	13656
Impact of Input Uncertainty on Failure Prognostic Algorithms: Extending the Remaining Useful Life of Nonlinear Systems	2013-06-19	2018-07-19	This paper presents a novel set of uncertainty measures to quantify the impact of input uncertainty on nonlinear prognosis systems. A xxxxxx Filtering-based method is also presented that uses this set of uncertainty measures to quantify, in real time, the impact of load, environmen- tal, and other stresses for long-term prediction. Further- more, this work shows how these measures can be used to implement a novel feedback correction loop aimed to suggest modifications, at a system input level, with the purpose of extending the remaining useful life of a faulty nonlinear, xxxxxx system. The correction scheme is tested and illustrated using real vibration feature data from a fatigue-driven fault in a critical aircraft compo- nent.	13657
High Power Room Temperature Terahertz Local Oscillator, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	We propose to build a high-power, room temperature compact continuous wave terahertz local oscillator for driving heterodyne receivers in the 1-5 THz frequency window. The local oscillator is based on the recently discovered terahertz emission of a high-power infra-red vertical external-cavity optically-pumped surface-emitting laser (VECSEL) when operated under dual-wavelength emission. The dual IR wavelength separation can be easily controlled by placing a thin etalon in the VECSEL cavity and the THz signal (corresponding to the beat frequency) is generated via a nonlinear periodically-poled lithium niobate crystal placed in the cavity. The VECSEL semiconductor gain element is designed and optimized to generate on the order of kilowatt internal circulating infra-red fields in the VECSEL cavity thereby generating tunable THz power in the milliwatt ranage. It is anticipated that this source will have wide applications within xxxxxx and the broader commercial community.	13658

Proposed xxxxxx probe is based on the generation of hydrogen from electrolysis at high altitudes using solar array, storing it in chemical hydride, utilizing it for altitude control in a balloon system and for power generation in fuel cell at lower altitudes. It is a challenge to have a durable power source in the low altitude environments, due to low solar intensity and low efficiency of RTG is inefficient. Primary batteries survive only for 1-2 hours. VIP-INSPR will refill hydrogen on one end and provide power on the other side continuously, thus enabling sustained exploration of the xxxxxx atmosphere.	13660
A Compact Sensor with Multiple In-Situ Sensing Capabilities, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx rocks, soils, liquids and atmospheric gases are ideal targets for scientists to study the possibility of life existence and the habitability, nature and evolution of planetary systems. Currently, xxxxxx uses different sensing technologies to analyze planetary samples. The use of multiple instruments increases the weight, complexity, power consumption as well as the probability of system malfunction. It is critical to develop lightweight miniaturized multi-functional sensor to enable xxxxxx multiple-mission needs and therefore make the best use of limited resources by reducing the cost, size, and the number of instruments. Crystal xxxxxxearch xxxxxx. (CRI) proposes a novel compact optical sensor with multiple in-situ sensing capabilities for measurements of various inorganic and organic samples for planetary study and search of biomarkers. The proposed technique is based on a nonlinear coherent interaction process to detect the backward spectral signals from the targets. The detection is enabled by using our novel electro-optic (EO) switchable spectral filtering technique to eliminate spectral artifacts and nonresonant background. The standoff scheme facilitates the implementation of multiple measurements by using a single sensor for nondestructive analysis of different samples on land surface or in atmosphere. It eliminates the sample preparation process, contamination and other related accessories.	13661

Odor Control in Spacecraft Waste Management, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx and lunar bases generate a variety of wastes containing water, including food wastes, feces, and brines.  Disposal of these wastes, as well as recovery of water, is necessary.  xxxxxxver, evaporation of water also evaporates compounds with foul odors, some of which are much more volatile than water.  Even apart from a water recovery system, foul odors sap crew morale, and must be eliminated. xxxxxxScaleREG  Corporation has developed a formulation of its proprietary sorbents, termed OdorKlenzTM, that has been shown to effectively remove odorous compounds from air by destructive adsorption.  xxxxxxScale proposes development of a similar formulation, built around nanocrystalline metal oxides manufactured by xxxxxxScale's proprietary procedures, such as xxxxxxxxxxxx TiO2, xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx, and xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx, to remove foul odors in a system that can recover water from wastes.  The odor control system will function during waste storage, and also during water recovery . In xxxxxx I, xxxxxxScale will demonstrate feasibility by developing a formulation of metal oxides capable of removing odorous compounds from food and sanitary wastes, and compatible with a water recovery system.  Specific test compounds include skatole (3-methylindole, found in feces), putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane, in rotten protein), ammonia (urine), ethanethiol, hydrogen sulfide (rotten eggs, flatus), butyric acid (rancid butter), and butyraldehyde.  Gas streams containing these compounds will be passed through beds of the metal oxide formulation, with concentrations measured by GC, before and after passing through the bed.  In xxxxxx, the odor control system will be integrated into the specific details of spacecraft and envisioned lunar stations.  Then, brassboard hardware will be developed and evaluated. xxxxxxScale, having pioneered the synthesis and manufacture of nanocrystalline metal oxides for destructive adsorption of hazardous compounds, is uniquely qualified to perform the proposed work.	13664

Self-Assembling Wireless Autonomous Reconfigurable Modules (SWARM), Phase II	2008-11-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxxs xxxxxx. and the MIT xxxxxx xxxxxxs xxxxxx propose Self-assembling, Wireless, Autonomous, xxxxxx (SWARM) as an innovative approach to modular fabrication and in-space robotic assembly of large scale systems.  Fabrication of modular components yields fabrication savings associated with large production volume and automated integration and test.  In-space assembly permits staged deployment on an as-needed, as-afforded basis.  It also decouples stowed launch geometry from deployed operational geometry.  The SWARM concept uses formation flown spacecraft, containing multiple universal docking ports, to dock with modular elements and maneuver them to dock with other, similar elements.  In the process, systems can be assembled that are much larger than what can be fit or folded into a launch vehicle fairing, or what can be launched on a single vehicle.  Furthermore, such modularity will allow jettison of failed components, upgrade of obsolete technology, and amortization of design costs across multiple missions.  In xxxxxx I, we demonstrated the feasibility of this approach for a simplified telescope assembly on the flat-floor at MSFC.  In xxxxxx, we will develop the hardware and software elements necessary to demonstrate, on a flat-floor, the modular assembly and reconfiguration of systems representative of trans-planetary spacecraft and large telescope assembly.	13666

Aircraft Structural Analysis, Design Optimization, and Manufacturing Tool Integration, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxovative research is proposed in integrating fundamental aircraft design processes with an emphasis on composite structures. Efficient, lightweight composite laminate structural design requires highly integrated structural analyses on the laminate and stiffened panel levels, while incorporating manufacturing processes and limitations. Laminate optimization is only one of the many design variables that need to be considered simultaneously in aircraft design. Yet true system level OML surface optimization is an extremely challenging problem that can only be made tractable by reducing the problem into three sequential gates: ply count compatibility, layup sequencing, and ply layout size and shape. The innovative approach proposed solves all three of these seemingly intractable gates and in so doing provides synergistic optimization of ply drops and adds and reduced manufacturing ply processing steps (drawing part numbers) along with laminate sizing to damage tolerance material allowables. To achieve the highest level of design fidelity requires iterative communication with the designer's CAD tool and ply zone mapping tools. Previous data exchange technology used by xxxxxx to couple separate discipline design tools is the XML xxxxxx file format. Proposed is the evaluation and implementation of a binary format called 'HDF5'.	13668
Compact Telescoping Array Design and Development, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx has significant interest in developing solar electric propulsion technology (SEP) and has identified SEP as enabling for many of xxxxxx near-term and long-term missions, including the asteroid redirect mission (ARM).  Large, scalable solar arrays are critical to enabling SEP missions, and could also serve many other sub-sections of the civil, commercial, and defense space markets.  A recently published paper by NIA and xxxxxx shows the Compact Telescoping Array (CTA) concept, which possesses the potential for 60 kW/m3 at 1 MW of power with an elegantly simple design concept derived in part from the international space station (xxxxxx) solar array. The potential performance of CTA, including packing density, scalability and structural efficiency, is excellent.  This array technology appears to be an excellent path forward for many current mission needs. Since the vast majority of CTA's subsystems can be implemented with elements that possess significant flight heritage, it is expected that significant progress can be made under xxxxxx funding to prepare CTA for infusion in the market. The proposed work advances the conceptual work begun by xxxxxx, Pappa, xxxxxx and xxxxxx.  xxxxxx, partnered with ATK space, proposes to explore combining flight-heritage sub-systems to progress the CTA concept, increase the xxxxxx of the overall design, and establish the path for successful commercial infusion.	13669
Environmentally Protective Fabrics for Spacesuits, Phase I	2017-06-01	2018-07-19	Luna is addressing xxxxxx?s need to develop new multifunctional textiles for improved Environmental Protection Garments (EPG).  Previous protective suits such as the xxxxxx era EPG or currently used xxxxxx xxxxxx (EMU) provide thermal and micrometeoroid protection, but are intended only for short duration use.  xxxxxx plans for a future manned xxxxxx mission will potentially require extended protection for up to 500 days.  Critical capabilities for these textiles include improved i) dust mitigation to protect from potentially corrosive or abrasive particles in the xxxxxx regolith, ii) cut and puncture resistance to protect the suit bladder from damage from sharp edges of tools and rocks, and iii) durability for extended use.  Luna will develop a multifunctional textile composite that will achieve these stringent goals, while maintaining comfort and mobility.  Our team will combine several well developed technologies into a practical textile design, which will provide excellent protection from dust, fire, chemical exposure, and cut/puncture.  These will be integrated to minimize weight and maximize flexibility such as to not prohibit, degrade, or interfere with the use of equipment.	13670
A Plateau-Burning, Low Temperature-Operable Solid Propellant for Mars Sample Return, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx ascent vehicle (MAV) is required to endure a long space transit time, high-g loading during planetary entry, and high launch loads, all at low temperatures of approximately -40 Deg C.   Additionally, low-temperature motors like the MAV are often tested at room temperature, since testing at temperatures of -40 Deg C or lower is both difficult and expensive.  Since testing at higher temperatures results in higher burn rates for typical propellants, and thus higher working pressures, ambient tests result in a motor case that is heavier than required for a low temperature mission, because ambient testing results in a higher maximum expected operating pressure.  Our proposed technology alleviates that problem by using a plateau-burning composite propellant that will substantially lessen the burn rate sensitivity to temperature.  As such, the MAV operating pressure in ambient conditions will more closely resemble those on the xxxxxx surface, allowing for a lighter motor case resulting in reduced weight, smaller volume and greater propellant mass fractions.  Additionally, our plateau burning formulation will include a low temperature binder with a high density fuel additive, in order to alleviate the loading stresses at low temperatures and further increase the motor density-xxxxxx.  This may allow us to eliminate the need for the MAV launch erection equipment currently baselined for the MSR mission.	13671

This will be performed in a highly manufacturable manner, using passively aligned pick-and-place technology to place the semiconductor components on the interposer substrate to form a system in package-type of integration platform for space photonic applications. The approach is based on a novel 3D hybrid integration approach developed at UCSB that is scalable, low cost, reliable, and that demonstrates superior thermal performance.	13672

Additive Manufacturing of Heat Pipe Wicks, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	Wick properties are often the limiting factor in a heat pipe design. Current technology uses conventional sintering of metal powders, screen wick, or grooves to fabricate realtively simplistic wick geometries. Additive manufacturing (laser sintering) of a porous structure would allow much greater freedom in defining the wick geometry and properties. One example is the RDU thermosyphon wick. Valuable real estate was consumed for a liquid reservoir for freeze/thaw tolerance. A more complex laser-sintered geometry could put the reservoir in the center, allowing greater evaporator area, lower heat flux, and lower DT. Another example is loop heat pipes, which are in limited use due to the cost. xxxxxx sintering of an LHP directly in to the evaporator bodye could greatly lower cost, making LHP vaible for commercial use. xxxxxxlying laser sintering to develop complex wick geometries can greatly extend heat pipe heat transport capabilities and lower cost.	13674
Resonating Nitrous Oxide Thruster, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	AeroAstro proposes decomposing nitrous oxide (xxxxxx) as an alternative propellant to existing spacecraft propellants.  Decomposing xxxxxx can be used as either a high xxxxxx, hot-gas monopropellant or as a low xxxxxx, cold gas for ACS thrusters.  AeroAstro further proposes to use an innovative technique to achieve xxxxxx decomposition: gasdynamic resonance.  Gasdynamic resonance will elevate the xxxxxx to the activation temperatures required for exothermic decomposition, allowing monopropellant operation without the difficulties of a catalyst.  One of the challenges of long-duration space exploration systems is finding a propellant for microspacecraft that is safe, reliable, robust, and performs better than current propulsion systems.  xxxxxx can replace both hot-gas propellants such as hydrazine and cold-gas ACS systems such as nitrogen or isobutane.  xxxxxx is non-toxic, has a low freezing point (-91oC), and stores as a liquid.  xxxxxx is also a byproduct of the catalysis of ammonia, a main effluent of waste-water recycling systems for long-duration manned space missions.  The anticipated results of this effort are data demonstrating the operating parameters of resonating xxxxxx, and a dual-mode thruster design capable of both hot-gas and cold-gas operation.  xxxxxx activity will evolve the design of the dual-mode thruster and demonstrate operation over a range of conditions.	13675

Coupled Viscous/Inviscid Analysis of Powered-Lift Airfoils and Wings, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	"This proposal is in response to xxxxxx xxxxxx Topic A2.08 in the area of \"Variable Fidelity, xxxxxxics-xxxxxx Design/xxxxxx xxxxxx\".  The development of a coupled viscous/inviscid analysis tool for powered-lift airfoils and wings is presented.  In this context, powered-lift airfoils are taken to be airfoils under the influence of a high-energy jet, and include jet-flaps, augmenter-flaps, upper surface blowing, and circulation control airfoils.  This methodology consists of coupling a viscous jet analysis, using a finite-difference approach, with a potential flow panel calculation.  The method uses an iterative procedure to capture the effects of viscous mixing and determine the correct jet shape. The goal in developing 2-D powered-lift predictions is to couple this analysis with a pre-existing modified Weissinger method to accurately predict 3-D wing performance based on sectional data.  In this manner, high-lift wing characteristics can be determined at a fraction of the computational cost of CFD.  An MDAO framework for aircraft-level optimization will be developed with the goal of integrating the powered-lift analysis such that ESTOL concepts and technologies can be incorporated at the conceptual and preliminary design stages."	13679

Multipulse Solid Rocket Motors for MAV, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx Ascent Vehicle is undergoing extensive vehicle trades to fine tune the optimal performance for a two-stage rocket motor solution to bring a payload from the xxxxxx surface to orbit.  The key is this vehicle must provide a terminal velocity of approximately 4 km/s, remain small in length and weight, and ensure the payload does not exceed 4 g's of acceleration during vehicle ascent.  xxxxxx on initial vehicle architecture optimization analysis completed by engineers at Arctic Slope Technical Services (ASTS), the acceleration limit places a significant impact on the grain profiles used on both the first and second stage rocket motors.  Therefore, the use of a dual pulse rocket motor grain design enables the use of two subsequent pulses that are ignited so as to mimic a single grain along the optimal thrust profile.  This solution burns down the risks associated with an end burning grain design.  The dual pulse grain design leverages finocyl designs that offers significant grain stress relief because of the fins.  Also this approach offers the ability for a smaller and lighter nozzle because of the shortened burn time. Moreover, this will provide significant opportunity for the motors to get smaller in length by being able to be packaged more efficiently.  This reduction in motor length will enable for a more stable vehicle in flight as well as enable the vehicle to carry either a larger volume payload or reduce the impacts on the transportation vehicle as it takes the MAV to the xxxxxx surface.	13681

Floating Seal For Turbopumps, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxgenic engines for in-space propulsion require innovative technologies to provide long-life, lightweight, and reliable turbopump designs.  One area open for improvement is seals for rotating-to-static hardware.  xxxxxx Turbine Technologies, xxxxxx. (FTT) is proposing the use of a floating seal for turbopump applications.  The floating seal would allow lower leakages than current state-of-the-art seals, such as labyrinth seals.  The floating seal also has the added benefit of maintaining low leakages throughout transients and rotor displacements, since the floating seal's clearance tracks with the rotor axial movement and is independent of radial movement.  Plus, the floating seal is a non-contacting seal with high pressure and speed capability; this increases its reliability relative to contacting face seals or labyrinth seals operating at the same conditions and leakages.  The floating seal is proposed to work with the cryogenic liquid propellants used in upper stage engines, liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.  The feasibility of the floating seal for turbopump applications will be determined through detailed 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses.  1D parametric studies to vary the seal geometry and boundary conditions will also be performed.  The concerns of axial instability and increased turbopump axial length will be addressed during xxxxxx	13683

(ATA) proposes a small business innovation research (xxxxxx) program for a novel compressor heat-extraction development program in response to xxxxxx solicitation for advanced design concepts to enable increased high stage loading in single and multi-stage axial compressors while maintaining or improving aerodynamic efficiency and operability. The 'compressor cooling' development program proposed herein will be applicable to advanced turbomachinery based combined cycle (TBCC) propulsion systems suitable for high xxxxxx number flight vehicles that extend to the hypersonic range as well as to conventional high bypass ratio (HBPR) engines that operate with high compressor exit temperatures. xxxxxx in the rear stages of a compressor would improve mass flow capability, increase margins set by material temperature limits, and improve turbine blade cooling effectiveness by reducing bleed air temperatures.The xxxxxx I proposal technical objectives are to 1) estimate the system level benefit of compressor heat extraction for a mutually agreed-on TBCC-powered aircraft mission, 2) understand the fluid dynamics of flows with surface heat extraction in a multistage compressor using computational fluid dynamics, and 3) define the necessary validation steps on cascade and compressor component rig hardware to advance the technology readiness level of compressor cooling to the point where it may be implemented in an aircraft engine application.

Metal Advanced Manufacturing Bot-Assisted Assembly (MAMBA) Process, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxs Unlimited, xxxxxx. (TUI) proposes to develop the Metal xxxxxxanced xxxxxx Bot-Assisted Assembly (MAMBA) xxxxxxess, a robotically managed metal press and milling system used to create precision parts on orbit.  This manufacturing process provides an alternative to 3D printing metals in space, which is difficult due to space environment or print quality issues.  Instead, the MAMBA-xxxxxxess relies on an ingot forming technology to create a metal ingot.  This ingot can then be milled and machined to form a precision part using a standard CNC milling technique.  In order to minimize astronaut time and exposure to the process, the MAMBA-xxxxxxess will be outfitted with a robotic assistant, using robotic assistance to remove the ingot from the press, to place the ingot in the mill, and to perform tool changes on the mill.  The MAMBA effort will also develop a novel process for management and recycling of metal chips in a microgravity environment. xxxxxx of the process technologies will lead to a lab demonstration of ingot formation and milling in the xxxxxx I effort, maturing the MAMBA xxxxxxess to xxxxxx-3.  In the xxxxxx effort, a full scale engineering unit will be built and tested to begin validating this technology for flight.	13685

Time reversal acoustic focusing provides the means to concentrate sound energy at any point in a material, inducing elastic nonlinear effects in the focal area. The level on nonlinearity depends on crack and defect presence and measurements of nonlinear effects in TRA focused wave are the basis of the proposed Nonlinear TRA NDE method.  This method is especially sensitive to detection of kissing bond that is difficult to detect by other methods. The experimental setups for measurements of local nonlinearity in FSW will be developed and results of the measurements will be compared with the standard weld NDE methods including dye penetrant, radiographic and ultrasonic inspection.	13686

A Thermal Imaging Instrument with Uncooled Detectors	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	In this proposed work, we will perform an instrument concept study for sustainable thermal imaging over land with uncooled detectors. We will define the science and instrument requirements and we will evaluate three different uncooled detector technologies, which have been conceptualized by our team (and are presently at low-xxxxxx). We will also build-up and demonstrate the materials characterization infrastructure required for progressing the xxxxxx of a chosen uncooled detector technology.The xxxxxxional xxxxxxearch Council&rsquo;s Committee on Implementation of a Sustained xxxxxxd Imaging Program has identified the inclusion of a thermal imager as critical for both current and future land imaging missions. Such an imaging instrument operating in two bands located at approximately 11 and 12 microns (for example, in xxxxxx, and also xxxxxx when launched) will provide essential information for furthering our hydrologic understanding at scales of human influence, and produce field-scale moisture information through accurate retrievals of evapotranspiration (ET). xxxxxx is slated to recycle the TIRS-2 instrument launched with xxxxxx that uses cooled quantum well infrared photodetectors (xxxxxxs) operating at ~43-65 K temperature, hence requiring expensive and massive cryocooler technology to achieve its required spectral and spatial accuracies (xxxxxx. 1).In contrast, we aim to conceptualize and develop a thermal imaging instrument which leverages recent and imminent technology advances in uncooled detectors. Such detector technology will offer the benefit of greatly reduced instrument cost, mass, and power at the expense of some acceptable loss in detector sensitivity. It would also allow a thermal imaging instrument to be fielded on board a low-cost platform, e.g., a CubeSat. In addition, it would enable capitalizing on the greater number of launch opportunities available for launch vehicles like xxxxxx (EELV) xxxxxxondary xxxxxx (ESPA).	13691

Hypersonic Reusable Technologies for Access to Space	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	The central objective of the proposal is to implement a robust multi-physics optimization on a hypersonic space-plane concept. xxxxxximization evaluates changes to the parameters of a design to achieve better performance. A robust optimization produces a design which is not very sensitive to uncertainties, such as uncertainties in the conditions of flight or in model accuracy. xxxxxx-physics simulation uses multiple physical models together to better simulate complex and coupled systems.The hypersonic regime is defined not as a specific xxxxxx number, but rather as the flight regime where a number of physical phenomena become more important. It is an extreme temperature environment where the physical characteristics of the air change as the gas becomes ionized, and the assumptions used in other flow regimes break down. Real gas effects and nonlinear aspects of the governing equations become important.The project that I have described could be considered under several of the xxxxxx Breakdown sections. Due to the methods used, it is related to section 11.3.3, Simulation xxxxxx xxxxxxs xxxxxxing. xxxxxxjet/scramjet engines (1.3.5) are fundamental to hypersonic design as air-breathing hypersonic vehicles are designed around their propulsion systems. The overall objective of my education program will be to implement a robust multi-physics optimization on a hypersonic space-plane concept. The Reusable Airbreathing Launch Vehicles program, which is in xxxxxxs xxxxxx program under Fundamental Aeronautics, will also be supported by this project.	13694
Long Burst Error Correcting Codes, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	Long burst error mitigation is an enabling technology for the use of Ka band for high rate commercial and government users.  xxxxxx xxxxxx, government, and commercial programs plan to use the xxxxxx due to its large capacity and flexible scheduling relative to other bands such as S, X, and Ku.  Current digital communications systems have become increasingly adept at managing degraded channel conditions using robust FEC codes and strategies such as adaptive or variable coding and modulation (ACM/VCM).  These strategies do not adequately address long burst error conditions on the order of 100,000 symbols.  Existing FEC codes of up to 16,000 symbols are inadequate.  xxxxxx methods to address this fast fade or burst error condition must be considered. In phase 1, we identify solutions to address long burst errors within the power and size constraints of a satellite application.  In xxxxxx 2, we modify an existing platform to demonstrate performance under real-world conditions and study the interaction of these mitigation methods with higher layer protocols.	13695

Optical Payload for Lasercomm Science	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	The xxxxxxical xxxxxx for xxxxxxcomm xxxxxx (OPALS) project, which is part of the JPL Phaeton early career employee hands-on training program, aims to demonstrate optical communications technology from the xxxxxx to Earth. This is accomplished by transferring a video from OPALS hardware onboard the xxxxxx to ar ground receiver at xxxxxx xxxxxxical Communications xxxxxx xxxxxx (OCTL) in xxxxxx, xxxxxx. To aid the OPALS in accurately pointing the downlink laser to the ground telescope, a laser beacon is transmitted from the OCTL to the xxxxxx OPALS hardware on xxxxxx. Each demonstration lasts for approximately two minutes, during which the xxxxxx and ground telescope maintain line of sight. The OPALS instrumentation gathers technical data during these demonstrations, which is then studied to determine hardware performance.   The scientific instruments in near-Earth and deep-space-missions increasingly require higher communication rates to transmit acquired data back to Earth, or to support high-data-rate applications (e.g., high-definition video streams). xxxxxxical communications (also referred to as lasercomm) is an emerging technology in which the data is modulated onto lasers to transmit the information. xxxxxxical communications offers the promise of delivering much higher data rates than the state-of-the-art with RF beams. xxxxxxver, because laser beams are very narrow, the spacecraft must be able to very accurately point the laser beam to the receiving telescope on Earth as it travels across the sky, which is one of the primary challenges of lasercomm.   xxxxxxical communications has the promise of meeting the high-data-rate expectations of future scientific instruments flying on xxxxxxs missions, and improving the interconnectivity between near-Earth assets, such as the xxxxxx and Earth. OPALS is one of xxxxxxs first demonstrations of an optical communications link from near Earth, and is designed to help chart the path for enabling optical communications in future missions. OPALS collects sensor data during the demonstrations to determine the performance of its laser link. The investigation team plans to use this data to advance the design and performance of future lasercomm links built to support xxxxxxs space endeavors. Additionally, OPALS is used to educate a team of early career employees being trained as the next generation of JPL/xxxxxx employees to develop space-based technologies.OPALS will demonstrate optical communication by transferring a video from the OPALS payload on the xxxxxx to a ground receiver at xxxxxx xxxxxxical Communications xxxxxx xxxxxx (OCTL) in xxxxxx, xxxxxx. As the xxxxxx travels across the sky, a laser beacon will be transmitted from the ground telescope to the OPALS payload and tracked. While maintaining lock on the uplink beacon using a closed-loop-control system and a two-axis gimbal, the OPALS flight system will downlink a modulated laser beam with a formatted video. Each demonstration lasts approximately 100 seconds as the xxxxxx payload and ground telescope maintain line of sight.	13700
Hardware Demonstration of a Joint Human/Automated Upset Recovery System, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	For manned aircraft, loss of control in flight and controlled flight into terrain are two main causes for aviation accidents. Recently, the authors have developed systems that autonomously execute recovery strategies to rapidly restore nominal flight without overcommanding the aircraft, exacerbating the upset condition, or endangering nearby structures and vehicles. The opportunity exists to extend the automated recovery system (ARS) by incorporating it in manned aircraft in a way that collaborates with the crew about corrective actions and utilizes crew expertise in real-time to provide the most effective recovery.  The proposed research will develop and demonstrate such crew-specific extensions to show the benefits of a collaborative human/automated (H/A) upset recovery system. Metrics will be defined to evaluate mixed H/A team performance both in terms of performance and crew experience, and a variety of levels of autonomy will be implemented including manned recovery, ARS advisory mode, human oversight of ARS autonomy, and fully autonomous mode.  A key goal is to demonstrate that a mixed H/A mode will provide significant advantages over what can be achieved by either the pilot or the fully autonomous system alone. Toward this end, human-in-the-loop hardware demonstrations will be used to demonstrate the benefits of joint H/A approaches and to set the stage for xxxxxx flight demonstrations.	13701
Low Gravity Anchoring System, Phase I	2012-08-01	2018-07-19	Future sampling missions to the xxxxxx, xxxxxx and xxxxxx will likely involve drilling and in-situ analysis from mobile robotic platforms in low gravity.

Programmable High-Rate Multi-Mission Receiver for Space Communications, Phase II	2010-11-01	2018-07-19	"Current and upcoming xxxxxx space links require both highly reliable low-rate communications links supporting critical TT&C, ranging and voice services and highly efficient High-data rate links supporting Mission or xxxxxx xxxxxx. Investing in re-usable elements, such as Programmable Communications Radios, for ground and flight data handling that are capable of receiving both kinds of links would address current Communication and Navigation needs without foregoing future capabilities. Additionally, the development, test, and optimization of new algorithms and modulation schemes require a high-speed platform able to be reconfigured as needed. Such a product would feature an open and modular architecture, allowing users to independently load and route custom code blocks. A modular and flexible High Rate xxxxxx Backbone (HRRB) would allow customization of some processing firmware and should accommodate advances in deployed link formats more easily than units \"factory loaded\" for particular signal types.SRI's xxxxxx xxxxxx researched, developed an architecture and test bed, and coded and tested an initial set of waveforms as a baseline for a Programmable High-rate xxxxxx-mission xxxxxx. The results of this effort showed the technical and commercial viability of such a unit. The proposed xxxxxx 2 effort will extend this innovation by developing and implementing an IF front end, refining and extending the performance of the ADC/DAC sections and hardware architecture, extending the architecture to support programmable and configurable decoding processing capacity, testing performance with both extended development support modulators/coders as well as other available high-rate modulators, and delivering a realized HRRB for further xxxxxx use. Additional market segmentation, analysis, and prospect identification would be conducted in preparation for either a xxxxxx 3 or independent SRI development of a market-ready Programmable High-rate xxxxxx-mission xxxxxx (PHMR)."	13703

Helium and Hydrogen Mixed Gas Separator, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	This product innovation is directed toward separating hydrogen from helium gas mixtures using a micro-channel separation unit with thin walls of a palladium-silver alloy. The micro-channels are produced in a size range of 100-200 microns such that the boundary layer thickness inside is drastically reduced when mixtures of helium and hydrogen gas flow through the channels. This thin boundary layer enhances the thermal and mass transport fluxes to the channel walls increasing the separation rate.  With this micro-channel approach, the membrane surface area to volume ratio is maximized reducing the operating costs and capital costs for the unit.	13705

Flight-Deck Interface for High-Precision Taxi Control, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	Faced with ever-increasing projections of air traffic, xxxxxx and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have been developing advanced technologies to increase traffic-handling capacity at existing airports.  Efforts to increase airport capacity approach the problem on two fronts: the first is to increase the number of runways (i.e. more usable space), and the second is to develop new technologies to achieve reduction in aircraft separation and consequently increase in landing rate per runway (i.e. higher density). xxxxxxhough increasing usable runways is ultimately inevitable, doing so often imposes new technical problems that compromise efficiency and safety.  xxxxxxing an existing airport layout increases surface traffic complexity with a higher level of aircraft and surface vehicle traffic, resulting in increased occurrences of runway crossing.  A previous xxxxxx-funded research addresses the air traffic control needs for ground-control operations with the development of a xxxxxx-Operation Situation Awareness and Flow Efficiency (GO-SAFE) system.  A new xxxxxx Operation Automation xxxxxxearch (SOAR) project explores the concept of collaborative automation between the GO-SAFE system and a xxxxxx-deck Automation for Reliable xxxxxx Operation (FARGO) system. The currently proposed effort will advance the interface technology to help the flight crew achieve the precise taxi control envisioned for the FARGO system.	13709
Lunar Sulfur Capture System, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxture xxxxxx (LSCS) is an innovative method to recover sulfur compounds from lunar soil using sorbents derived primarily from in-situ resources. Most of the sulfur released from lunar soil during higher-temperature thermal treatment is trapped by the LSCS at lower temperatures on iron oxides present in lunar soil. As needed, small amounts of polishing sorbents are used to reduce equilibrium sulfur concentrations to the low ppm level. After sorbents become saturated, sulfur compounds are desorbed and converted to useful sulfur products. xxxxxx is present in concentrations of about 0.1 percent in lunar soils and can be recovered by the LSCS as a useful product from in-situ resource utilization (ISRU). The LSCS can capture and recover sulfur from lunar soil as a primary product during thermal desorption of volatile compounds or during thermal reduction ISRU processes used for oxygen production. Removal of sulfur compounds is required during ISRU to prevent electrolyzer damage, catalyst poisoning, and equipment corrosion. The LSCS is applicable to thermal ISRU reduction processes in which sulfur is released in forms such as hydrogen sulfide (xxxxxx), carbonyl sulfide (COS), or carbon disulfide (CS2).	13710
Big Data Driven Architecture for Real Time Systemwide Safety Assurance Phase II, Phase II	2018-05-01	2018-07-19	Our proposed research work significantly enhances the state-of-the-art in aviation data analytics by providing, for the first time, a one-stop resource for meeting data analysis needs of aviation researchers, analysts and practitioners.  The resulting xxxxxx-based Aviation Big xxxxxx Analytics xxxxxx benefits multiple xxxxxx projects: RSSA real-time safety assessment, SMARTNAS test-bed, and the xxxxxx xxxxxx data warehouse. Our innovation is researched through achievement of five objectives and associated work efforts. The first objective is the refinement of use cases for the big data application. We draw upon our knowledge gained in xxxxxx I research and continued interactions with aviation stakeholders to narrow the use cases to specific applications that are a challenge to xxxxxx and the broader aviation community related to RSSA, SMARTNAS, and other xxxxxx research efforts. The second objective is to create a Big xxxxxx technology-driven architecture and processing capabilities for the more specific use cases developed to meet objective 1. The third objective is to achieve a subcomponent demonstration for each refined use case so that we can measure the benefit of using these techniques to solve xxxxxx analytics challenges. The fourth objective is to tie together the demonstration components developed as part of objective 3, into an overall architecture offering a one-stop-shop for both at-rest and in-motion analytics to meet a variety of research needs. Finally, our fifth objective is to pursue commercialization via outreach to government and industry stakeholders. Most current aviation research focuses on smaller datasets or specific data-types. A massive amount of data thus sits un-analyzed and potentially holds a rich set of undiscovered trends that may be valuable for aviation safety-assurance and NAS efficiency-enhancement. Our xxxxxx will greatly contribute to the advancement of aviation research by enabling truly big data analytics on this massive, un-tapped data.	13711

Power Generating Coverings and Casings, Phase II	2017-07-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxxances in structured heterogeneity together with nanomaterials tailoring has made it possible to create thermoelectrics using high temperature, polymer composites. While such thermoelectrics do not have the capability to approach the efficiency of top performing ceramic modules such as BiTe, they do provide two unique aspects of use in energy scavenging: the ability to conform to irregular large shaped areas easily, and the ability to integrate kinetic energy scavenging together with heat scavenging. During xxxxxx I, the group at Wake Forest xxxxxxersity demonstrated that the combination of thermal and vibrational power production is actually synergetic &#150;the amount of power generated is greater than the sum of the individual components. This improvement in nanocomposite thermoelectric performance, coupled with effective kinetic energy scavenging makes the piezo-thermo-electric \"xxxxxxFelt&#153;\" applicable to a wide range of power collection scenarios. xxxxxxhough the goal of making a 1-m2 material was not completed, significant progress has been made and this capability will be available in xxxxxx. A sample of \"xxxxxxFelt&#153;\" was sent to the xxxxxxional Institute for xxxxxxs and xxxxxx for independent testing.

Benchmark Numerical Toolkits for High Performance Computing, Phase I	2010-01-01	2018-07-19	"Computational codes in physics and engineering often use implicit solution algorithms that require linear algebra tools such as Ax=b solvers, eigenvalue, optimization, or graph algorithms. xxxxxxers face major challenges in selecting linear algebra tools that can support their algorithms, numerical schemes, meshes, and computing hardware and to minimize the time, space and complexity. The existing libraries such as PETSc or LAPACK are \"stretched\" to the limits by new generation application codes which create big, unsymmetric, often dense, and poorly conditioned matrices. One of the obstacles in effective utilization of linear algebra libraries is lack of benchmark quality representative test cases and benchmarking toolkits for these types of problems. This project will develop, demonstrate and deliver a comprehensive numerical test suite for benchmark evaluation of linear algebra solvers for computational application software on High Performance Computers. Unlike existing benchmarks on static, Ax=b matrix, problems CFDRC-TACC team proposes new generation of dynamic, discipline specific and multidisciplinary functional benchmarks accounting for sparse/dense and unsymmetric matrices using web accessible benchmark matrix/problem generators. Our team has excellent expertise and tools (multiphysics solvers, sparse/dense solver libraries, benchmark cases, related projects, and understanding of xxxxxx engineering/scientific challenges) as well as xxxxxx resources to achieve this goal."	13718

Our approach will use a cavity-dumped resonator to directly generate Nd 1.4-micron pulsed output, and injection seeding for spectral narrowing. This approach, while based on established technology, is innovative in finding an optimal solution from uncommon elements. Our design allows us to start with a well-behaved four-level laser instead of the problematic quasi-three-level lasers like Er:YAG and Er:glass (fiber). Moreover, it avoids the loss in efficiency that comes from using an OPO pumped by the common 1-micron Nd or Yb laser to generate eye-safe near-IR output. We also propose to demonstrate that our laser performance is tolerant of high-temperature operation, making passive cooling possible with major advantages in overall size, weight, wall plug efficiency, and power scalability.	13720

High Quality, Low-Scatter SiC Optics Suitable for Space-based UV & EUV Applicati, Phase I	2003-07-01	2018-07-19	SSG Precision xxxxxxronics proposes the development of a novel opticalmanufacturing process that will allow the production of state-of-the-artxxxxxx Carbide (xxxxxx) optics.  The work proposed combines threedifferent manufacturing technologies, a slip cast xxxxxx mirror formingprocess and low temperature CVD xxxxxx coating process, which have beendeveloped by SSG, and Computer Controlled xxxxxxical Surfacing technology(CCOS) which has been developed by Tinsley, a subsidiary of SSG.  Thecombination of these technologies will provide xxxxxx optics withstate-of-the-art surface figures (low frequency and mid-frequency errorswill both be addressed) and low-scatter surface finishes.  xxxxxx opticsoffer a number of critical advantages for space-based optical systems.The superior material properties of xxxxxx provide a high degree oflightweighting (70&#37; - 90&#37; of beryllium) and a superior thermal stability(1.5x ? 2.5x better than ULE).  The manufacturing process proposed willallow the technical advantages associated with xxxxxx materials to berealized, providing the capability to produce imaging mirrors which arecapable of providing excellent accuracies (&lt;0.01 waves RMS), lowmicro-roughness (&lt; 10 xxxxxxs RMS), and very low areal densities(~10 kg/m2 at an aperture of 1 meter) while maintaining the thermalstability required for space-based imaging applications.

Multi-Configuration Matched Spectral Filter Core, Phase II	2016-04-01	2018-07-19	OPTRA proposes the development of a modular, reconfigurable matched spectral filter (RMSF) spectrometer for the monitoring of greenhouse and volcanic gases.  The heart of this spectrometer will be an RMSF core, which can be paired with different fore-optics or detector modules to achieve active point or passive standoff detection of the chemicals of interest.  The RMSF core is comprised of a dispersive spectrometer that images the sample spectrum from 3 &#150; 5.5 micron onto a digital micro-mirror device (DMD) such that different columns correspond to different wavebands.  By applying masks to this DMD, a matched spectral filter can be applied in hardware.  This results in a highly flexible system that can address a wide variety of chemicals by simply updating the DMD masks applied and a wide variety of applications through modular hardware design.  Use of the DMD and a single element detector in place of a conventional FPA results in significantly reduced cost and improved performance in terms of image uniformity, pixel operability, and dynamic range.  The proposed xxxxxx effort will produce a prototype RMSF core with one set of fore-optic and detector modules for each of the two detection modalities.	13725

Development of a Cathode Liquid Feed Electrolyzer to Generate 3,600 psi Oxygen for Both Lunar and Space Microgravity Environments, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxxchemical xxxxxxs (GES) proposes to develop a cathode liquid feed, proton-exchange membrane electrolyzer stack and system capable of producing 3,600 psi oxygen.  In preparation for this xxxxxx I effort, we propose to collaborate with xxxxxx-xxxxxx Human xxxxxx xxxxxxs (H-S) to share unique state-of-the-art technologies that provide the best path to meeting program objectives.

A full experimental matrix will be conducted on these units in a cathode liquid feed configuration.  Balanced pressure operation would be conducted at GES facilities (from atmospheric to 2,000 psi).  Differential pressure testing would be conducted in H-S facilities (at pressures between 2,000 and 3,600 psi).  xxxxxx would then be integrated into the GES analysis code, and be available as a design analysis tool for future phases of the program.	13727

Unsteady Simulation of Dual-Mode Transition Flows Using a Hybrid LES/RANS Approach with Improved Sub-Grid Scale Models	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx access today is via rocket-launched vehicles like xxxxxx. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the propulsion systems, and the need to carry on-board oxidizer, these launch vehicles have small payload fractions. This limitation indicates a real need for the development of revolutionary launch technologies for space access. xxxxxxing candidates for next generation launch vehicles include two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) concepts utilizing advanced hypersonic air-breathing propulsion for the first stage. xxxxxxver, the successful design and operation of such vehicles is hindered by a fundamental lack of predictive capability of the high-speed turbulent combustion processes occurring through the ramjet-to-scramjet flight regime. Only after researchers successfully address this fundamental inadequacy can advanced hypersonic air-breathing technologies be used to revolutionize means of space access.This research plan aims to develop advanced computational models for predicting flow conditions within a scramjet engine as it transitions through the ramjet-to-scramjet dual-mode regime. xxxxxxment of these models will be achieved by answering two primary research questions of interest: (1) how can the wide range of flow scales occurring during dual-mode transition be modeled with sufficient accuracy to capture the relevant turbulent flow and combustion physics, and (2) how can the advanced models be implemented within existing computational frameworks for minimal runtimes? This proposal leverages existing developmental frameworks, in addition to developing novel models and methods, to answer these questions. Answering the first question relies on expanding state-of-the-art models like xxxxxx (LES) and the flamelet generated manifold (FGM) approach. The primary deficiency of LES is insufficient sub-grid scale (SGS) models for the flow regime of interest, and the FGM approach is currently incapable of predicting pressure-dependent combustion physics. This research aims to develop joint probability density function (PDF) SGS models to achieve the necessary accuracy of the flow physics and to develop an FGM approach incorporating pressure effects. This LES/PDF/FGM approach will be used to model flow away from the wall, whereas a hybrid LES/xxxxxx-Averaged xxxxxx (RANS) approach will be used near the flowpath wall. The answer to the second question relies on leveraging the VUxxxxxxN computational fluid dynamics framework to implement the LES/PDF/FGM and hybrid LES/RANS approaches in a cost-effective and timely manner. Long runtimes plague advanced simulations of dual-mode transition and other high-speed turbulent reacting flows; however, this research aims to incorporate these models into VUxxxxxxN in an extensible manner using novel algorithms that will accommodate later generation models. The research proposed herein aims to develop a complete understanding of the dual-mode transition flow process and upon doing so, advance the development of revolutionary means of space access. Not only will this research benefit development of TSTO concepts, but it will also benefit the xxxxxx flow physics modeling community at large. By developing the LES/FDF/FGM model within an established xxxxxx framework, like VUxxxxxxN, the resulting capabilities will be made widely available. This ease of access will lead to applications of this approach in areas outside of its initial region of inception. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the proposed research represents a key step in achieving xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx goal and one of the most important xxxxxx xxxxxx Grand Challenge: Economical xxxxxx Access. Understanding and modeling dual-mode transition flow physics is a pressing hurdle that must be overcome before TSTO hypersonic air-breathing technologies can be used to revolutionize the nation's means of affordable and sustainable space access.	13730

RAT data products will be comprised of time-ordered data records that include motor positions, motor currents, contact switch states, temperature sensor values, bus voltage, software/algorithm states, error bit fields, etc. xxxxxx records will be written to the detailed data product at a nominal rate of 2-Hz.	13731
Spatially and Temporally Resolved Diagnostics of Dense Sprays Using Gated, Femtosecond, Digital Holography, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	This is a proposal to develop a unique, gated, picosecond, digital holography system for characterizing dense particle fields in high pressure combustion environments; a critical requirement clearly defined in the xxxxxx solicitation. Most imaging methods fail to provide this capability because noise from multiple scattering buries the signal needed to acquire a useful image. xxxxxxutions to this problem are expensive, difficult to implement, and not ideal candidates for field experiments. The proposed innovation combines digital holography and picosecond, optical gating to limit the amount of optical noise sufficiently to enable high resolution, 3D imaging, effectively generalizing existing pseudo-ballistic imaging systems that have been used for imaging through dense particle fields. Storing the complete wavefront in a hologram enables use of a wide range of optical diagnostics methods including image processing and interferometry to improve image and information quality. The result is a new sensor concept that will be extremely useful in the experimental study of dense sprays and other particles fields, providing a detailed, instantaneous look at the structure and position of all of the particles as well as density field information in a large three dimensional sample volume. Moreover, the system can record dynamic information at high frequency.	13732

At present no study investigated the complexity of the molecular changes in human or mouse paraspinal muscles exposed to microgravity. The aim of this study was to evaluate longissimus dorsi and tongue (as a new potential in-flight negative control) adaptation to microgravity at global gene expression level.

Improved UAS Robustness through Augmented Onboard Intelligence, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	This work will focus on the development of a highly capable avionics subsystem and machine learning algorithms to provide early warning of potential failures of critical subsystems on small UAS. This modular system will consist of networked onboard monitoring nodes capable of observing operations and providing notification of off-nominal conditions to the autopilot as well as the operator, mitigating the risk of failure, and providing critical information regarding required maintenance. The boards, while computationally powerful will be limited in size, weight and power to avoid significantly impacting the performance of current vehicles and simplify its installation. Furthermore, the networked devices will be able to communicate with each other as well as the autopilot, allowing for vehicle wide information to contribute to a high degree of awareness of the vehicle's well-being. The primary objectives are:1.Determination of a set of subsystems commonly employed by UAS whose failure would cause a system critical issue. 2.The identification of a set of sensors and machine learning algorithms capable of providing the necessary inputs to detect the health and status of its associated subsystem, and determining the probability of a fault occurring in the near future.3.The design of a monitoring node capable of interfacing to the required set of sensors and implementing the machine learning algorithms.  The nodes will also be limited to a size and weight that will allow for them to be installed on most UAS without impacting the vehicle's performance.4.The design of an onboard network capable of supporting communications between all smart monitoring nodes on the aircraft.  Each node can then communicate any potential failures to the autopilot and/or operator as well as share information that will allow for the implementation of distributed machine learning algorithms between the nodes and recognition of cross-correlation between systems.	13734

Battery Health Management System for Electric UAVs	2013-04-26	2018-07-19	In summary, this paper lays out a novel battery health management technique for application onboard an electric UAV. This technique is also applicable to other electric vehicles, like electric cars. Electric cars are not new; they were more popular and reliable at the turn of the twentieth century as compared to their gasoline powered rivals. xxxxxxver, the uncertainty in determining battery life plagued electric vehicles then as it does now. A recent report by the Consumer xxxxxxnics Association, xxxxxx: The Future of Driving‖, indicates that although these vehicles are increasing in popularity, running out of battery power on the road is the top concern for consumers (71% of adults surveyed). Thus developing advanced battery health management techniques is very important. the RUL pdf. This is turn can motivate and inform mission replanning activity. The PF prognostic framework can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of possible mitigation actions, thus improving operational safety and optimizing battery power.	13736

Development of an Engine Air-Brake for Quiet Drag Applications, Phase II	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	A novel quiet engine air-brake (EAB) is proposed in response to xxxxxx solicitation for active and passive noise control concepts for conventional and advanced aircraft. The EAB concept is applicable to 1) next-generation, conventional tube and wing aircraft (current generation +1) and 2) advanced integrated airframe/propulsion system configurations (current generation +2, +3).  Potential retrofit opportunities are also envisioned.  xxxxxx analysis on xxxxxx Source xxxxxx (SDT) fan stage suggests that an EAB could realize three to four decibels overall noise reduction under the approach flight path by generating a swirling exhaust with drag equivalent to one to two turbofan-sized bluff bodies per powerplant. Such drag generation could enable slower and/or steeper and/or aero-acoustically cleaner approach trajectories. A xxxxxx development program is proposed to 1) perform aerodynamic designs of dual-stream, swirling bypass flow nozzles and experimentally assess their performance and noise, 2) develop conceptual aero-designs that address current engine architecture issues such as pylon duct bifurcations, and 3) develop a prototype design of an EAB for validation in a model-scale rig. The final deliverable to xxxxxx will be a written report presenting design, analysis and experimental results from blown nozzle testing, plus a prototype EAB design.	13739

Industrial Crystallization Facility for Nonlinear Optical Materials, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	Made In xxxxxx, xxxxxx. (MIS) proposes the development of an Industrial Crystal Facility (ICF) for microgravity product manufacturing and applied research. The ICF is focused on advanced materials engineering, rather than biomedical research, and serves a complimentary role to existing xxxxxx-developed hardware, expanding utilization of xxxxxx. Intended applications include nonlinear optical single crystals and other relatively large material formulations. This is a critical next step in the development of xxxxxx as an economic development zone, using the xxxxxx xxxxxx as a proving ground and following the forthcoming Made In xxxxxx xxxxxx (MIS xxxxxx) demonstration of manufacturing a product in space with economically-significant intrinsic value on the ground. The xxxxxx xxxxxx serves as an ideal platform to explore whether industrial crystals can be grown in microgravity to larger sizes and/or improved quality as compared with terrestrial sources. Existing low temperature solution growth methods take days to weeks to complete, so parabolic flights and suborbital vehicles are not suitable for establishing process baselines and making effective comparisons. xxxxxx production holds the potential for room-temperature production of NLO materials for high-energy applications with size and quality undiminished by the effects of sedimentation and convection. A new facility is needed to explore the feasibility of microgravity-enabled industrial crystals as a new product market for xxxxxx.	13741

Lightweight and Flexible Metal Halide Perovskite Thin Films for High Temperature Solar Cells	2018-10-01	2018-07-19	The goal of this project is to develop metal halide perovskites (MHPs) based solar cells for high temperature operation. MHPs have been recently discovered as high performance photovoltaic materials and the record power conversion efficiency of 20.1% has been reached. To date, silicon solar cells and multijunction solar cells have been dominantly used for space missions. Despite the previous success, employing these conventional solar cells for inner planet missions has been challenging due to loss of solar cell efficiency at high temperature. This originates mostly from the fact that all conventional solar cell materials exhibit negative temperature coefficient of bandgap which results in reduced open circuit voltage at high temperature. In contrast, very interestingly, MHPs exhibit positive and small temperature coefficient of bandgap which provides an intriguing opportunity for development of solar cells that maintain performance at high temperature. This project aims to combine experiments and first principles calculations to obtain fundamental understanding of the unusual positive temperature coefficient of bandgap of MHPs. The obtained insights will enable rapid material screening of various MHPs to identify compositions appropriate for specific mission temperature ranges. Prototype solar cells will be fabricated to test performance and stability at high temperature. If successful, this project will result in transformative advances in space solar power generation that enable higher specific power, lower cost and simpler operations compared to the state of the art approaches.	13743
Multi-Physics NTR Safety Analyses, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) offers high promise to reduce launch mass, decrease mission costs and increase mission effectiveness, particularly for crewed missions to the planets.  xxxxxxver, NTP has been plagued with high uncertainties in cost, schedule and safety, particularly launch safety.  To reduce programmatic uncertainty, an unambiguous approach to documenting NTP safety prior to, during and after launch needs to be made.  Until recently, the multi-physics models and computing power were not available to perform compelling analyses,  and testing is exceptionally expensive, and unrevealing in many cases.This proposal directly addresses programmatic uncertainty by providing benchmarked, definitive product documenting the safety of a NTP system during all launch phases.  The proposal takes work performed by the SBC under IR&D which has performed detailed hydrocode modeling of a NTP impacting an unyielding surface from heights of 50 and 150 meters.  These impact and compaction results, in this xxxxxx will be analyzed using the meash0based Serpent 2 nuclear code to demonstrate that the reactor will not become critical during compaction events, or will demonstrate what design changes must be incorporated in order to ensure this end.If the NTP system can document an unambiguous safety case prior to major program decisions, it will dramatically reduce programmatic uncertainty, and provide decision-makers with a far less costly approach to NTP development.Because the entire reactor must be designed, modeled and subject to impact scenarios, it is not possible to obtain meaningful results at the component level.  Small-scale analyses have sown the viability of this approach and the LPS team is ready to proceed to a full-scale NTP engine.	13744

The goal of xxxxxx will be to design, fabricate, and fully test xxxxxx based DC/DC converters that can achieve high power density and ultra-lightweight by operating the power switches at high junction temperatures. Present state-of-the-art silicon based spacecraft power systems operate at a power density of approximately 1.5 W/cm?, while the high temperature xxxxxx based power converters proposed by APEI, xxxxxx. in this project will operate at a power density of approximately 4.5 W/cm?, or 3? the density of present high performance silicon based systems.

This technology is also well suited for other HAN-based or ADN-based monopropellant formulations, such as LMP-103S, and will provide increased performance and new operating regimes for future xxxxxx missions.

For improved reliability and to assure stand-alone functionality, the network would support a real-time 3D location function using mobile-assisted navigation and utilizing TOA/TDOA methods.To achieve unparalleled power consumption efficiency, Lexycom proposes the use of energy-aware packet routing and cognitive selection of operating point of the transceivers. Along with the scheduling, we plan to use an innovative RF packetization technique aimed to virtually obsolete negotiations between the network nodes prior to change in transmitted signal parameter on a packet-by-packet basis.We anticipate that after completion of the xxxxxx I, Lexycom will be more than capable of delivering an operational prototype EVA SDR for further evaluation and enhancements of the chosen concepts and approaches.Since Lexycom Technologies is the manufacturer of an FCC certified, reconfigurable, small form factor and low power consumption SDRs, we are in an ideal position to transfer and expand our knowledge base from our existing radio platform over to the EVA radio.	13748

Two-phase pumped loops are an ideal solution for these applications.  A critical need for these pumped loops is a microgravity-compatible evaporator having a large cooling area to maintain the temperatures of multiple electronics and instruments. The evaporator must be able to accommodate multiple heat loads with a wide range of heat flux densities and allow heat loads to be mounted on any available locations of its cooling surfaces to facilitate vehicle-level system integration.  To this end, Creare proposes to develop a lightweight, compact evaporator with innovative internal design features to adaptively distribute liquid refrigerant to heated areas, preventing dryout in areas with high heat flux.  This advanced flow distribution feature reduces liquid recirculation flow in the pumped loop and thus the system power input. The design features also provide strong internal structural support for the evaporator, reducing the size and mass of the evaporator cover plates. In xxxxxx I, we will prove the feasibility of the evaporator by developing a preliminary evaporator design, predicting its overall performance, and demonstrating its key performance features and fabrication processes by testing.  In xxxxxx, we will optimize the evaporator design, fabricate a full-scale evaporator, demonstrate its steady state and transient performance in a representative pumped loop, and deliver it to xxxxxx JPL for further performance evaluation.	13750

This GI program is targeted specifically at Fermi observations of high-energy solar phenomena, primarily solar flares.  We provide quicklook products, data archives, and analysis software covering the solar X-ray and gamma-ray observations of both the xxxxxx-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Large Area xxxxxx (LAT), with the objective of facilitating and encouraging the broad use of Fermi data by the international solar physics community.	13752

ODYSSEY MARS MARIE REFORMATTED RAW DATA V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	The MARIE (xxxxxx Radiation Environment Experiment), aboard the 2001 xxxxxx spacecraft, was launched on April 7, 2001, and arrived at xxxxxx on October 24, 2001. xxxxxx were collected intermittently during the cruise phase, starting in late April and ending in late xxxxxxy. A problem with MARIE's onboard computer occurred in early August, and the instrument was turned off until early xxxxxxh, 2002, after Odyssey's mapping orbit had been established. xxxxxx have been collected from that time to the present without major interruption. Routine minor interruptions of up to 48 hours have occurred during the orbital phase when the instrument's data is erased from local storage (after having been downloaded). MARIE is oriented to point in the direction opposite Odyssey's velocity vector. xxxxxx radiation is for the most part isotropic, so the orientation of Odyssey is usually not critical and references to external coordinate systems are not a part of the data returned by MARIE. There is one exception to the statement that space radiation is isotropic: During the early stages of solar particle events, there can be directionality in the particle flux.	13754

Fiber Optic Mass Flow Gauge for Liquid Cryogenic Fuel Facilities Monitoring and Control, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx xxxxxx I proposal describes a fiber optic mass flow gauge that will aid in managing liquid hydrogen and oxygen fuel storage and transport. The increasing use of hydrogen as a fuel places the safety of facilities and personnel at the forefront of concern, making an explosion proof fiber optic system a desirable option.  Further, the actual available fuel can depart significantly from the expected quantity due to variable boil-off and leak rates and inaccurate measurements.  Measurement accuracy can be complicated by low gravity, stratification of the liquid density and temperature, the presence of a gas phase, the wetting of tank surfaces by the liquid and the lack of suitable sensors and instruments.  xxxxxx objective is to deliver a prototype that will withstand the high pressures and flow rates at liquid hydrogen and oxygen temperatures demanded by rocket propulsion systems.	13756
Propellantless Spacecraft Formation-Flying and Maneuvering with Photonic Laser Thrusters	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	Until the former NIAC was closed, we had investigated a nano-meter accuracy formation flight method based on photon thrusters and tethers, Photon xxxxxx xxxxxxion xxxxxx (PTFF), with the maximum baseline distance over 10 km for the next generation xxxxxx space missions. Since photons have extremely small thrust per power, thrust amplification by recycling photons between two high reflectance mirrors located separately in two pairing satellites was proposed to overcome the limit. Our original emphasis was on propellant-free nanometer accuracy tethered formation flying, however, during our study on photon thruster demonstration, we discovered that our photon thruster (Photonic xxxxxx xxxxxx, PLT) has a much larger potential in xxxxxx mission applications than precision tethered formation flying. The potential resulted from a surprising discovery on the extraordinary stability of PLT against dynamic motions of mirrors in our unique active optical cavity, which may enable in space propulsion for an extremely wide range of unprecedented xxxxxx missions. For example, 10,000 times recycling of photons with 15 kilo-watt input laser power, which can be delivered by a 100 kW solar panel would produce up to 1 N of photon thrust, which is sufficient to enable these missions. One of most crucial technologies to scaling up and implementing the PLT is Directed Energy technology that has developed and matured long range delivery of high power laser beams. The state-of-the-art DE technology is capable of delivering powers of multi-mega-watts over distances of hundreds of km, and matured precision pointing and focusing capability. Recently, an AFRL researcher for DE unintentionally demonstrated ~5 mN (more than 100 times scaling up of our previous NIAC demonstration of 35 μN) photon thrust in PLT with the use of a kW-class Thin xxxxxx, although the laser was not optimized for PLT. Currently, the DE community is developing much higher power lasers, and the adaptation of such lasers for PLT can facilitate xxxxxx-class PLTs in the near future. Therefore, the time has arrived to develop and implement PLT for a wide range of unprecedented in-space xxxxxx applications and this is the motivation for the present NIAC xxxxxx proposal.	13757

Optical Feather and Foil for Shape and Dynamic Load Sensing of Critical Flight Surfaces, Phase I	2014-05-01	2018-07-19	"Future flight vehicles may comprise complex flight surfaces requiring coordinated in-situ sensing and actuation.  Inspired by the complexity of the flight surfaces on the wings and tail of a bird, it is argued that increasing the number of interdependent flight surfaces from just a few, as is normal in an airplane, to many, as in the feathers of a bird, can significantly enlarge the flight envelope.  To enable elements of an eco-inspired Dynamic Servo-Elastic (DSE) flight control system, IFOS proposes a multiple functionality-sensing element analogous to a feather, consisting of a very thin (gauge 18 or 20) tube with strain sensors and algorithms for deducing the shape of the \"feather\" by measuring strain at multiple points.  It is envisaged that the \"feather\" will act as a unit of sensing and/or actuation for establishing shape, position, static and dynamic loads on flight surfaces and in critical parts.  IFOS proposes to develop advanced sensing hardware and software control algorithms to demonstrate the proposed DSE flight control concept.  The hardware development involves an array of optical fiber based sensorized needle tubes for attachment to key parts for dynamic flight surface measurement."	13759

Optimized Lift for Autonomous Formation Flight	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	Experimental in-flight evaluations have demonstrated that the concept of formation flight can reduce fuel consumption of trailing aircraft by 10 percent. xxxxxx researchers have developed a peak-seeking control algorithm that can increase this efficiency by another 2 percent. The innovation works by optimizing, in real time, the lift distribution across the wing of an airplane flying within the wingtip vortex of another airplane. Conventional trim schedules use xxxxxxsymmetric (equal but opposite between the left and right wings) aileron deflections to counter roll asymmetries and keep the wings level. In formation flight, however, this approach can &ldquo;dump&rdquo; lift near the wingtip where the vortex effects are greatest, reducing the amount of benefit gained. The peak-seeking solution instead uses all available control surfaces across the span of the wing (including wing flaps used for landing) as required to find the best solution to maintain trimmed flight within the vortex.Work to date: The research team has developed a multi-vehicle transport-class aircraft simulation that includes probabilistic models of the wind-drift and descent of aircraft wakes, the aerodynamic interference effects of wingtip vortices on other aircraft, and formation guidance and control laws. The team has also developed a roadmap for the maturation of formation flight technology to Cooperative xxxxxx operations; that is, commercial transport aircraft operations at extended distances of 1-2 nautical miles.Looking ahead: The group is developing a flight experiment to demonstrate drag reduction through cooperative trajectories using commercial, off-the-shelf avionics systems, including ADS-B data link technology. The experiment is expected to fly in 2015.BenefitsEfficient: Improves fuel savings in formation flight by an additional 2 percentEconomical: Achieves objectives with existing control surfacesSaves time: xxxxxx airplanes to fly closer together, reducing airspace congestionxxxxxxxxxxxxd cost for commercial passenger and cargo aircraft operationsExtended range for military aircraftMore efficient multi-vehicle, cooperative applications for drone aircraft	13762

UV Radiation Testing of Space Suit Materials	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	Human missions to xxxxxx may require radical changes in our approach to EVA suit design. A major challenge is the balance of building a suit robust enough to complete multiple EVAs in the dirt under intense UV exposure without losing mechanical strength or compromising its mobility. Promising new materials—including dust repellent fabrics—have been identified as potential solutions, yet none of these have been tested in realistic UV environments to characterize their viability going forward. We will conduct ground testing on new materials to determine performance degradation after exposure to xxxxxx mission equivalent UV and compare the results to control materials matching those currently used on the EMU. This will mature the material technologies and provide performance data that can be used by not only the space suit development teams but for all xxxxxx inflatable and soft goods derived structures from airlocks to habitats. The following will be required to complete this testing:  Select materials according to their prominence on the current EMU and advanced space suits such as Z-1 and Z-2.

Solid-Solid Vacuum Regolith Heat-Exchanger for Oxygen Production, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx xxxxxx-1 project will demonstrate the feasibility of using a novel coaxial counterflow solid-solid heat exchanger to recover heat energy from spent regolith at 1050oC to pre-heat inlet regolith to 750oC, either continuously, or in 20kg batches.  In granular solids the area of contacts between 'touching' grains is quite small.  Thus, solid-solid conduction often plays only a minor role in heat transfer through granular solids (i.e., 'effective' conduction), and when an interstitial gas is present, heat transfer occurs primarily via conduction through the gas.  If the granular solid is also flowing, then solids convection becomes a significant factor in overall heat transfer and effective 'conduction'.  Under vacuum conditions, and at temperatures above 700oC, radiation will dominate most heat transfer processes; however, solids convection can also play a very significant secondary role.  Utilizing judicious placement of radiation baffles, and a novel counterflow configuration, the approach proposed in this xxxxxx can accomplish the desired heat transfer between spent and fresh regolith with only one moving mechanical part, by making effective use of both radiative heat transfer and solids convection.  xxxxxx-element simulations of regolith flow will be utilized to refine the concept.  Utilization of an existing ~1.4 cubic meter partial-vacuum facility at the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx will facilitate construction of feasibility demonstration prototypes during xxxxxx-1 and/or xxxxxx-2.  The xxxxxx-1 project will demonstrate the effectiveness of combining solids convection with radiative heat transfer to rapidly transfer heat from 1050C spent material to heat fresh regolith to 750C under vacuum conditions.	13765

In xxxxxx I, high-gain, electron-initiated avalanche photodiodes (e-APDS) were designed, manufactured, and characterized over a range of temperatures. The e-APDs, sensitive from 1064 nm to 4300 nm, were fabricated in single-layer p-type xxxxxx films grown using liquid phase epitaxy on IR-transparent xxxxxx substrates. Variable-diameter e-APDs, large-area 250-micron diameter e-APDs, and segmented 1-mm x 1-mm e-APDS - each with sixteen 250-micron x 250-micron pixel elements - were mounted to ceramic submounts, tested, and characterized. Under receiver bias, the e-APDs exhibited exponentially increasing gain that exceeded 1250. The devices showed exponentially increasing gain as a function of cutoff wavelength, and with decreased temperature - in agreement with our models for xxxxxx e-APDs.In xxxxxx, we will optimize xxxxxx films for 1.5-3.6 micron response and fabricate 250-micron diameter e-APD elements, designed for operation with gains exceeding 1250, without excess noise. These e-APDs, when integrated with custom-designed <100 e- rms noise transimpedance amplifiers and optimized to match the e-APDs' capacitance, will realize single photon sensitive LIDAR receivers for xxxxxx LIDAR applications.	13770

Enhanced Dynamic Load Sensor for ISS (EDLS-ISS), Phase II	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxs and the xxxxxx Institute of xxxxxx (MIT) propose to develop a stand-alone 6-DOF load sensing system that collects biomechanical force and moment data while integrated with the xxxxxxanced xxxxxxistive Exercise Device (ARED) on xxxxxx by adapting and enhancing previously field-tested systems.  Our EDLS-xxxxxx system includes a separate base unit tethered to two low-profile sensors, which can be non-invasively mounted on the surface of the ARED to serve as new footplates.The EDLS-xxxxxx is being developed for two reasons:- Operational.  Force plates on the ARED will allow crewmembers to verify loading, and to record forces.  This device provides a simple, non-invasive solution that measures foot forces and displays this to the astronaut.- xxxxxxearch.  Kinematic experiments on the ARED &#150; for example, characterizing limb segment relative motions during a squat &#150; require corresponding force and moment measurements.  Our EDLS-xxxxxx system provides three-axis force and three-axis moment measurements for such experiments.By providing a short-term operational solution and a sustainable long-term research solution, ELDS-xxxxxx is an important tool for the spaceflight community.During xxxxxx I, we improved the design of the existing 6-DOF xxxxxx Investigation of xxxxxx Reactions in 0-G (MICR0-G) xxxxxx sensor module, previously developed by xxxxxx and MIT.

Multi-Mission MicroSDR, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx proposes to develop a low-power and compact reconfigurable radiospecifically targeted to xxxxxx mission needs. We envision the radio to bewell matched to small satellites, terrestrial ground links, andautonomous vehicles. The design is based on the latest in fieldprogrammable gate array (FPGA) and general purpose processors (GPP).Typical software defined radios (SDRs) rely heavily on digital signalprocessors (DSPs) due to their ease of software development and abilityto multitask well. Our emphasis will be on performing all basebandprocessing inside the FPGA due to its ability to offer over an order ofmagnitude increase in computational efficiency. While this approach doessignificantly decrease power consumption and associated platform size,it requires special considerations, particularly in terms of softwaredevelopment. As such, we will leverage xxxxxx's ongoing experience incomputationally efficient waveform and associated software developmentusing the latest in FPGA behavioral design tools. In addition, thearchitecture will stress logic component reuse between multiplewaveforms to support rapid reconfiguration as well as reduce developmenttime. Our RF front-end design will be a direct-conversion architectureto reduce size and provide frequency agility. The use of open-standardsinterfaces will provide for rapid systems integration.	13776

CubeSat Form Factor Thermal Control Louvers	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	As small spacecraft become a part of xxxxxx&rsquo;s repertoire of missions, one reoccurring theme is an increased need for thermal control as power budgets increase and tight instrument temperature tolerances are introduced on smaller platforms. Until now xxxxxx have not needed thermal control outside of resistive heaters due to the low power and short lifespan of most CubeSat missions. xxxxxxver, in the past few years CubeSat solar panels have been developed by private companies which can produce up to 80W of power for a 3U (30X10X10 cm) spacecraft. Now CubeSat and small satellite missions are being proposed which rise to meet this new technological envelope, with high power instruments and multiple months or years of mission life. Therefore it is critical that a thermal control system be designed for small spacecraft missions, particularly xxxxxx. The CubeSat xxxxxx Thermal Control Louvers use passive thermal control to significantly improve the internal thermal stability of small spacecraft, creating a difference of several watts in dissipated heat between open and closed louvers. Thermal control of small spacecraft, including xxxxxx, is a challenge for the next era of xxxxxx spaceflight. xxxxxx objectives and components will still require strict thermal control while smaller volumes will inherently absorb and shed heat more quickly than a larger body. Thus, game-changing technologies must be developed to stabilize the thermal environment inside of small spacecraft. xxxxxxing this technology will help place xxxxxx at the forefront of thermal control expertise in the fast-growing arena of smallsats and xxxxxx.The proposed CubeSat louver assembly will be based upon the proven designs of full-sized louvers for large spacecraft. Internal spacecraft components will be thermally coupled to the side of the spacecraft. Bimetallic springs serve as a passive control mechanism for opening and closing flaps. As the&nbsp;spacecraft heats&nbsp;up the springs expand due to the difference in thermal expansion rates of their two fused metals (hence bimetallic). This opens the flaps, changing the thermal radiation properties of the exterior surface. As the spacecraft cools the flaps close and return the exterior surface to the previous emissivity. These temperature-driven adjustments create a more stable thermal environment for components.xxxxxx of the thermal louvers assumed that the louvers were in darkness, either shielded by the solar panels or facing deep space. The hand calculations of power dissipated via the thermal louvers shows a substantial difference between fully closed and fully open louvers at the high temperatures significant for electrical components.	13778

Eltron's carbon nanostructures are highly conductive and offer an ordered mesopore network. These attributes will provide more complete electrolyte wetting, and faster release of stored charge compared to activated carbon.Preliminary studies have shown that Eltron's materials meet or exceed the performance of major EC manufacturers. The xxxxxx I objectives will be to further increase performance with regards to high power/short duration demands.

LGM2605 as a mitigator of space radiation-induced vascular damage, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	LignaMed, LLC is a drug development company with a fast track strategy to approval of LGM2605, an oral small molecule for use as a radiation mitigating agent that reduces harmful effects of radiation exposure of normal tissues. LignaMed aims to evaluate LGM2605 as a mitigator of space-radiation induced vascular damage. xxxxxx missions to xxxxxx will expose astronauts to solar and galactic cosmic mixed radiation including low dose &#947; and proton radiation, but data is lacking on the biological and physiological effects in humans of this mixed source radiation. xxxxxxearch on space radiation effects on cellular systems, molecular targets and ultimately organ systems has identified potential harmful short and long-term effects on the health of astronauts. Work at the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx identified damage to lungs years after a single exposure to low-dose gamma, 56Fe, 28Si and proton radiation exposure in mice. Acute and chronic radiation effects in organs are closely associated with vascular damage and dysfunction. xxxxxx studies have confirmed single source radiation side effects associated with significant loss of vascular integrity: increased vascular leakiness (edema), an activated inflammatory phenotype and extensive oxidative damage. xxxxxxver, damage to the vascular network under multiple radiation types simultaneously is not understood. LignaMed will employ gene knockout technology in vascular models exposed to space-relevant mixed radiation regimens to investigate the injury to the vasculature. We hypothesize that LGM2605 will mitigate space radiation-induced vascular damage by inhibiting early events that cause inflammation. This study will confirm that 1) space radiation drives endovascular damage via activation of the endothelial inflammatory phenotype resulting in increased permeability and 2) will validate LGM2605 as an effective mitigator of space radiation-induced vascular damage by inhibiting early events that drive long term adverse sequellae.	13789

MULTI PHASE FLOW DECOMPOSITION AND IMAGING USING ELECTRICAL CAPACITANCE VOLUME TOMOGRAPHY SENSORS, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	The proposed innovation aims at using Electrical xxxxxxacitance xxxxxxume Tomography sensors (ECVT) for decomposing components of a multi-phase flow into separate phases, electronically. Here, each phase would be imaged and measured independently for accurate assessment of phase boundaries, phase velocity, and phase hold-up or distribution. This innovation is based on exploiting the dependence of electric properties of several materials on excitation frequency at which electrical capacitance is measured. xxxxxx and conductivity values of liquids often undergo changes as the excitation frequency used in acquiring capacitance values is changed. For example, previous studies quantified the change in dielectric constant and dielectric loss of aqueous liquids, including de-ionized water, under different frequencies. Their findings show that such liquids often undergo significant changes in electrical properties with varying excitation frequencies. Typically, ECVT sensors are excited at frequencies in that range of tens of Khz to tens of Mh. At those frequency ranges, the electric properties of materials, especially those that contain water in multi-phase flow mixture, undergo significant changes.	13792

Nonequilibrium Plasma Applications for Water Purification Supporting Human Spaceflight and Terrestrial Point-of-Use	2017-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx technology generates powerful advanced oxidation processes (AOP’s) that attack organic contaminants and bacteria. This is achieved via a process known as mineralization where organic compounds are reduced to carbon dioxide, water, and inorganic salts. The extremely high electric fields kills bacteria by rupturing their cell membranes.  Due to the extremely short duration time-scales (nanoseconds), the chemistry and physics of these processes are not well understood.Most conventional water treatment processes are based on filtration, ozonization, UV-treatment, reverse-osmosis, and chemical consumables (e.g. chlorine).

The objective of the proposed project is to use plasmonic/photonic hybrid crystals to develop multiwavelength polarimetric focal plane arrays (FPAs) that exceed performance requirements for ACE and CLARREO, while reducing costs through component integration. Plasmonic/photonic hybrid crystal films are an enabling technology and can be used to develop high spectral resolution, low crosstalk components for other xxxxxx missions, such as GEO-CAPE, as well as transparent metal contacts for high-efficiency sensors and solar cells, Additionally, hybrid crystals eliminate several problems, such as diffraction, light scattering, moving parts, and the need to dice/bond components.

The polarimetric control of the flow of light allows the development of devices that separate polarization components of an incident beam and detect the separate components in the same or different pixels of a FPA. The hybrid crystals can play several roles, including polarization splitter/filters, antireflection coatings, superfocusing elements and electrical contacts.	13804

Low Power, Low Cost Igniter for Nonhypergolic Mars Ascent Vehicle, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Decomposing monopropellant hydrazine across a spontaneous catalyst bed is the gold standard for small propulsion systems responsible for attitude control on satellites and spacecraft.  Such a propulsion system is both simple and reliable, and offers reasonable performance.  xxxxxxver, the simplicity and reliability enjoyed today is the result of a nearly two-decade effort designed to identify and perfect a spontaneous catalyst.  xxxxxx hydrazine replacements generally do not work well with hydrazine catalysts, so the enormous costs associated with a new catalyst development effort have stalled the widespread acceptance of potential hydrazine replacements.Our proposed effort will explore the use of an alternative ignition source that eliminates the need for a catalyst bed entirely.  It achieves the same simplicity enjoyed by traditional monopropellant propulsion systems, but dramatically increases thruster response time on both startup and especially shutdown.  It requires low power because it exploits a unique property of most of the propellants often cited as the future replacement for hydrazine.  It is also low cost because it requires a very low part count and development issues will be trivial.	13810
Measurement of Combustion Response to Transverse Modes at High Pressure	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	The coupling between acoustics and unstable combustion has been a prime concern and unsolved problem over the entire modern history of chemical propulsion. These instabilities are extremely complicated due to the myriad potential coupling mechanisms and multiple length and time scales of the combustor and combustion processes. With frequencies greater than 1000 Hz, high-frequency combustion instabilities can impact combustor performance and lead to catastrophic failure due to overheating. Experimental work at xxxxxx is part of a larger effort to integrate experimentation, high order models, and engineering level models to better predict combustion instability and to better serve future engine design and performance. An absolutely unique experiment is being used to provide a representative unstable flowfield to which the response of propellant combustion can be measured. Imaging processing techniques are used to identify combusting structures in injector flowfields and their response to pressure and velocity instabilities. Combustion light intensity as measured by a filtered high speed camera is used as an indicator of local unsteady heat release. Combining heat release and high frequency pressure measurements, the damping and driving effects of an injector shall be identified based on xxxxxxís criterion of instability. These data are compared to high fidelity computer models to distill combustion response functions that can be used in engineering-level models. When fully developed this diagnostic method could be deployed on operational rocket engines to actively control against unstable behavior or implemented on research combustors for more standardized, complete experimental results.	13811

Robust Path Planning for Space Exploration Rovers	2017-08-01	2018-07-19	Motion planning considers the problem of moving a system from a starting position to a desired goal position. This problem has been shown to be a computationally challenging task. This mainly arises due to complexity of the system being controlled and environmental factors that occur in the real world, such as sensor noise and imperfect actuation. The system being controlled might also have many degrees of freedom, allowing more complex tasks such as manipulation of the environment. A motion planner that can handle these type of disturbances and capabilities is ideal to produce robust paths that robotic systems can follow.The proposed work will attempt to address these issues by building off of state-of-the-art research in asymptotically optimal sampling-based motion planning. This process will involve developing an algorithm that can efficiently solve the motion planning problem for system that have dynamic constraints on their movement, e.g. car-like vehicles. By developing an algorithm that can provide optimality for dynamical systems, many other applications may be branched off of it.The first application to explore in this direction is planning under uncertainty. The uncertainty in environment and actuation is observed in the real world whenever we use a robotic system. This uncertainty is magnified when performing extra-terrestrial rover missions from ground stations here. It would be beneficial to have an autonomous planner be able to handle these disturbances, allowing ground crew to focus on more important tasks, such as waypoint selection.	13815

Total moment density and temperature are given. Each electron spectrum is also fit with a thermal component and 1-3 hot components depending on how many xxxxxxians are needed to fit the entire distribution. The moment density and temperature of the hot component is calculated after the thermal component is subtracted from the spectrum. The CHIxxxxxx value for each fit is given. The spacecraft charge is not calculated consistently, and may result in factor of 2-3 errors in the thermal electron density. xxxxxx is unreliable inside 5 RU and in the occultation regions. At xxxxxx measurements were taken using both a long and a short integration time. Each 48 SEC measurement frame contained either an E1-Short and an E2-Long measurement or an E2-Short and an EI-Long. To reduce systematic errors, complete electron spectra were obtained only by combining two long or two short spectra. The instrument threshold is at a density of about 0.001 CM-3 yield data close to this value should be treated with caution. Flags in the data indicate whether the full analysis could be performed and if the data was contaminated by LECP stepping. A complete description of this data set is in xxxxxx (1987).	13818

The process is based on a novel, low temperature, ion-assisted, evaporation technique (IAD), whereby the coating stress of a silicon film may be manipulated from compressive to tensile, in order to produce a near-zero net stress for the complete layer.   A cladding with little intrinsic stress is essential to minimize bending that would otherwise distort the figure of very lightweight mirrors.   Current methods to produce a polishable silicon cladding utilize CVD processes that produce highly stressed Si coatings.  The current processes require high-temperatures (hundreds of degrees xxxxxx) and are not readily scaleable to large mirrors.  CVD Si cladding is currently limited to mirror substrates less than 1-meter in diameter.   The proposed IAD process produces little heat, and the mirror size is limited only by the size of the vacuum chamber.Large silicon carbide (xxxxxx) mirrors (3-4 meters in diameter) are being considered for future space-based UVOIR astronomy missions.   These lightweight mirrors will likely require a highly-polishable layer of silicon (10 to 50 microns) applied on top of the xxxxxx.   A relatively thick layer of Si is desirable for the purpose of reducing figuring time and for achieving a super-polished surface, suitable for UV astronomy. Normal incidence 4-meter class UVOIR telescopes have been cited as a high priority by multiple government review panels including; the xxxxxxional xxxxxxearch Council's (NRC) study of xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx and Priorities, The Office of the Chief Technologist, The xxxxxx Program and NWNH Decadal.	13821
A Novel RSPF Approach to Prediction of High-Risk, Low-Probability Failure Events	2013-05-09	2018-07-19	xxxxxx filters (PF) have been established as the de facto state of the art in failure prognosis, and particularly in the representation and management of uncertainty in long-term predictions when used in combination with outer feedback correction loops. This paper presents a novel Risk- Sensitive PF (RSPF) framework that complements the benefits of the classic approach, by representing the probability of rare and costly events within the formulation of the nonlinear dynamic equation that describes the evolution of the fault condition in time. The performance of this approach is thoroughly compared using a set of proposed metrics for prognosis results. The scheme is illustrated with real vibration feature data from a fatigue-driven fault in a critical aircraft component.	13822
Automated Trajectory Design Using Resonant Dynamics	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	The goal of this project is to map spacecraft transit routes through resonances. This will enable automated, on-board trajectory redesigns to allow for autonomous and safer missions. In particular, this will benefit high priority xxxxxx missions such as a xxxxxx and xxxxxx xxxxxxet xxxxxx orbiters as well as xxxxxx to small bodies as a stepping stone to xxxxxx.Current missions and future mission concepts such as xxxxxx and the various xxxxxx orbiter proposals have indicated that resonant regions near small bodies and planetary moons exhibit fast acting orbital instabilities. This may prevent mission designers on Earth from having time to issue new commands. The availability of autonomous targeting methods related to these dynamics would provide a systematic means for taking advantage of resonant regions and mitigate the associated risk.While spacecraft will not have the time or computational power to completely plan new trajectories from scratch, there is another method. We propose to create a database of key routes that will be organized using the language of symbolic dynamics. xxxxxxances in libration point dynamics have shown that transit orbits can be classified in this way and our intent is to extend this to other resonant regions. Finite automata and fast search techniques will be used to select a seed trajectory that accomplishes the necessary goal. This will then be differentially corrected to the exact conditions to yield an accurate path that will direct the spacecraft.	13823

A High Energy and High Efficiency Spectral Shaping Single Frequency Fiber Laser, Phase II	2009-11-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx phase II project proposes a single frequency high energy fiber laser system for coherent xxxxxx systems for remote sensing. Current state-of-art technologies can not provide all features of high energy and efficiency, compactness, narrow linewidth, super frequency and power stability, low noise, and high extinction ratio at the same time. PolarOnyx proposes, for the first time, a high energy (1 mJ) single frequency (< 1 KHz) fiber laser transmitter to meet with the requirement of solicitation. It is a specialty fiber based MOPA operating at 1550 nm. PolarOnyx proposes a revolutionary approach to fundamentally resolve the issues of nonlinear effects by employing our patent pending proprietary technologies in fiber lasers. Our unique spectral shaping techniques enable us to reduce the SBS and ASE noise significantly in the amplifier for commercially available EYDFs and to reuse the residual pump to further increase the efficiency. These will make the fiber laser transmitter system superior in terms of wall plug efficiency (over 30%), energy(1 mJ), noise, size, and cost. In xxxxxx I, we have demonstrated all major functions of the proposed idea and shown a practical energy scaling capability in proof of the concept. A prototype of 1 mJ level fiber laser will be delivered at the end of xxxxxx.	13825
Improved Metal-Polymeric Laminate Radiation Shielding, Phase II	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	In this proposed xxxxxx program, builds on the phase I feaibility where  a multifunctional lightweight radiation shield composite was developed and fabricated. This structural radiation shielding is high strength, syntactic polymeric where the polymer is filled with high strength low Z material. The phase II program will provide radiation modeling and testing for these new structural radiation solutions as well as a physical property database for using them in space habitats.  xxxxxx program will address issues including flammability, attachment, and incorporation of these new materials into existing and future space habitat designs.  The accumulation of the phase II program will be prototype components that can be tested at xxxxxx level 5 or flown for xxxxxx level 6.	13826
Aromatic Thermosetting Copolyesters for Ablative TPS, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Better performing ablative thermal protection systems than currently available are needed to satisfy requirements of the most severe crew exploration vehicles, such as the xxxxxx with 12-15 km/s Earth entry.  The primary objective of CU xxxxxx's xxxxxx I work will be to fabricate and test aromatic thermosetting copolyesters (ATSP) composites for use as ablatives in next generation spacecraft missions. The synthetic development of novel aromatic thermosetting copolyesters was a major innovation in the field of polymer science. Previous testing of their capabilities showed excellent performance as adhesives, rigid foams, matrices for composites, and dielectrics for microelectronics.  Only recently has this material been considered as a viable ablative due to its high temperature stability and excellent composite mechanical properties especially due to the liquid crystalline nature of the polymer, which allows a matching of CTE between fiber and matrix. Our team partner the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx at Urbana-Champaign will assist CU xxxxxx to perform basic research and provide technical support to accelerate the transition of ATSP polymers into ablative composites. If successful CU xxxxxx envisions the ATSP to be utilized in a wide variety of applications in both civilian and military spacecraft, either as a retrofit or as a next-generation design.	13827

A Novel Microfluidic Device for Fully Automated Extraction of RNA from Cell Cultures, Phase II	2006-11-01	2018-07-19	Obtaining high quality, intact xxxxxx from cells is an ubiquitous need in the pursuit of space biology. Our overall objective is to develop and commercialize a microfluidics based miniaturized platform (MED-xxxxxx) that can fully automate the complex process of xxxxxx isolation. xxxxxxing from harvested whole mammalian cells in a culture medium, MED-xxxxxx will lyse, capture, and isolate xxxxxx content for later analysis, in a fully integrated fashion with minimal user intervention. In addition to higher yields and faster process times, losses and contamination will be minimized as a result of the miniaturization and automation. A novel and unique plastic card based fabrication technology from xxxxxxnics Corp. will be leveraged for low-cost microfabrication. The xxxxxx I study successfully demonstrated concept development and design of three critical aspects of the MED-xxxxxx, (1) on-card reagent based cell lysis, (2) non-toxic electric field driven cell lysis, and (3) xxxxxx capture and elution in a microfluidic extraction chamber. xxxxxxical prototypes of the components were fabricated and experimentally demonstrated. During xxxxxx, we will further optimize the individual component designs. xxxxxximal components, along with necessary valving will be integrated on a plastic, microfluidic lab card. The fully integrated prototype lab card will be demonstrated on chosen cell lines. Further ensuring success, CFDRC has assembled an experienced, multidisciplinary team.	13831
Multi-Species Chemical Microsensor For Real Time Cryogenic Purge Line Monitoring, Phase II	2018-04-01	2018-07-19	Makel xxxxxxing, xxxxxx. proposes to develop a miniaturized xxxxxx-Species Chemical xxxxxx xxxxxxent suitable for real-time, in situ measurements of hydrogen, oxygen, water vapor and mixture thermal conductivity for monitoring purge effectiveness in cryogenic propellant lines.  xxxxxx is a scarce, strategic and non-renewable natural resource.  xxxxxx is a major user of helium and significant future cost savings in operations can be realized with improved monitoring of purge activities.  Without real time measurement of species being purged from systems, extended purge cycles and excess helium is used to ensure completely purged lines.  The proposed sensor system will incorporate the required microsensors in a compact probe to enable multi-parameter monitoring in a single measurement port.  The system will be designed to be permanently installed in purge and vent lines at cryogenic propellant storage, transfer, test stand and launch facilities.  This program will adapt low cost and low power chemical microsensor technology which was originally developed for leak detection applications and recently been demonstrated in proof of concept cryogenic vent tests at xxxxxx to develop a low cost, robust integrated sensor probe and electronics with data interfaces suitable for real time monitoring and control helium purge sequences to minimize overall helium usage.	13832

Performance Quantification of Solar Sail Heliogyros for Planetary and Interplanetary Missions Using Multi-Scale Dynamics and Control Analysis	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	The focus of this proposal is the guidance and control of a particular type of solar sail and supports xxxxxx exploration goals as outlined in TABS element 2.2.2: xxxxxxar Sail Propulsion. xxxxxxar sails are large, extremely thin sheets of reflective material that use sunlight to provide continuous thrust. To provide meaningful thrust levels, the sails must be lightweight, gossamer structures with several hundred square meters or more of reflective area. The primary advantage of sails is that they do not use propellant for thrust or attitude control allowing for theoretically infinite mission duration and infinite impulse. It is this elegance and limitless potential that make sails so attractive.xxxxxxearch into this cutting-edge propulsion system has extraordinary promise for a wide variety of applications. xxxxxxar sails could make many prohibitively expensive missions cost-effective and enable many more that are impossible without sail power. For example, a sail-craft placed between the Earth and the xxxxxx could enhance solar storm early-warning and help protect the nation's space assets. Also, a sail-craft could attack the growing threat of space debris by capturing defunct satellites, shuttling them to a super-GEO graveyard, and repeating indefinitely. Further down the road, sails offer the prospect of inexpensive, reusable cargo transport to xxxxxx and beyond. These are just a few of the many applications of this technology. Nevertheless, much work remains before government and commercial agencies will commit to a large-scale sail-craft mission.This research aims to further develop guidance and control for a specific type of solar sail: the heliogyro. In this case, the sail is divided into long blades supported by the centripetal acceleration of the spacecraft's spin alone. The heliogyro's attitude, and therefore thrust vector, is controlled by changing the cyclic and collective blade pitch similar to a helicopter. One advantage of this design over a more traditional square sail is the lack of blade support structure. This cuts mass and increases acceleration or payload capacity. Additionally, sail deployment is much simplified; simply spin the spacecraft up, and allow the blades to unspool.The inability to effectively ground test such large, delicate structures makes a deeper analytical understanding essential. This research will attempt to show that heliogyros are a viable method of both attitude control and main propulsion. The objective is to answer three essential questions about heliogyro controllability: How much can heliogyros improve mission performance? What are the feasible attitude control methods to achieve that performance? How can we control the pitch of highly-flexible blades to attain the desired attitude? xxxxxx, especially JPL and xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Center, have been developing this technology intermittently for decades. As early as the sixties, JPL conducted preliminary design work on a heliogyro for a xxxxxx's Comet rendezvous mission. More recently, they developed the S5 (xxxxxxar Sail xxxxxxflight Simulation Software) toolkit. xxxxxx launched a solar sail proof-of-concept, xxxxxxSail-D, only weeks ago and is developing its successor, FeatherSail. This research will combine an analytical exploration of the fundamental concepts, simulations of the orbital and attitude mechanics, and finite element analysis of the sail structural dynamics to develop a comprehensive theory of the factors involved in solar sail control. The goal is to provide engineers with the tools required to design and plan a heliogyro sail-craft mission so that someday soon we may begin to realize the vast potential solar sails have to offer.	13834
Electronic Prognostics for Vehicle Health Management, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	All electronic systems are prone to wear-out and eventual failure and this has direct implications for Vehicle Health Management for xxxxxx with its long space missions.  The accurate prediction of an impending failure can provide significant savings in functionality and mission success.[1]  xxxxxx and timely failure prediction can support the mitigation of catastrophic faults in spacecraft systems as well as autonomous control and dynamic repairs to faults.  xxxxxxnic prognostics provide advanced warnings of impending electronic module failures.   The specific innovation proposed will provide tools for setting and determining the advanced warning time for prognostic-enabled electronic systems, also referred to as defining the remaining useful life (RUL).  The testbed will be a high efficiency, DC-to-DC xxxxxx Converter commonly found in advanced power systems. Such power converters are commonly found in a wide range of electronic systems to adjust power levels, yet are subject to failures.   The innovation would help prevent data loss and support uninterrupted operation.  The reason for funding is that xxxxxx has a stated requirement for autonomous and automated solutions to systems health management systems and electronic prognostics are required to support this objective.	13835
Detector Development for Polarization Studies of the Cosmic Microwave Background	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	Among the most pressing questions remaining in cosmology today are the issues of the true nature of dark energy and the mechanism of inflation. Studies of the polarization anisotropies of the xxxxxx provide one of the most promising methods of obtaining insight into these key gaps in our understanding of the origins and evolution of the universe. This proposal is for work on detector and focal plane technology development for the new polarization sensitive receiver for the Atacama Cosmology xxxxxx (xxxxxxPol). xxxxxxPol aims to directly explore both of these unanswered questions by characterizing the polarization and temperature anisotropies of the CMB at small angular scales. xxxxxxPol will also serve as an important ground-based test of the developing polarimeter technology that will be needed for a future space-based mission to probe the energy scale of inflation. Through the assistance of this xxxxxx fellowship my work on this project will provide key technology development and testing that will increase xxxxxx ability to fulfill its scientific objectives.	13836
Active Radiation Shield, Phase I	2017-06-01	2018-07-19	DEC-Shield technology offers the means to generate electric power from cosmic radiation sources and fuse dissimilar systems and functionality into a structural component to create a xxxxxx-functional Structure (MFS).   DEC-Shield integrated into MFS technology can be used to generate electric power and provide radiation protection in a space vehicle; even maximizing that protection by spreading the required systems and components across the structure.  GTL will develop several DEC-Shield concept designs, fabricate test articles and test them in a representative radiation environment to demonstrate proof of concept.  Further, GTL will analyze the test results and develop an optimized proof of concept DEC-Shield design. xxxxxx effort will culminate with the design, fabrication and testing of DEC-Shield prototype Demonstration Panel that incorporates electrical power generation from GCR and solar wind sources.	13837

TFM Performance Monitoring and Review System, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	"A wide variety of flow management techniques is employed every day in the NAS, from strategic xxxxxx Delay Programs (GDP's) with national scope to local Miles-In-Trail (MIT) restrictions that affect traffic over a specific fix.  The choice of the flow management technique to employ and the timing, extent, and other parameters associated with the technique are determined by controller judgment informed by experience.  xxxxxxver, experience is only as useful as the information that can be assimilated from it, and in the case of flow management decisions the available information is limited and biased.We propose to research and prototype a system that will provide controllers with the metrics they need to understand how their past decisions fared.  Our proposal in this xxxxxx I xxxxxx is to perform the research to determine how well such metrics could be made to function. xxxxxx would extend the work to implement metrics that could be used within xxxxxx efforts and later transitioned to the FAA for its use.The proposed metrics do not attempt to determine what the \"correct\" level of restrictions would have been.  The appropriate amount of restriction to apply in any situation is a matter of judgment that must weigh the certainty of the information on which it is based as well as the outcomes that would result from errors in either direction.  Rather, the metric would quantify the restrictions' performance in hindsight.  To quantify performance of a GDP, for instance, it would measure the degree to which tactical flow management had to make up for excessive airborne demand for the airport, and the degree to which insufficient demand was available to fill the airport's capacity.  xxxxxxond-order effects the metric would quantify include the degree to which the traffic originating in-center, in tier one, in tier two, and farther away gained or lost priority relative to each other, indicative of the GDP's timing relative to the timing of the demand/capacity imbalance."	13839
Time Inter-Comparison Using Transportable Optical Combs, Phase II	2019-05-01	2018-07-19	AOxxxxxx proposes a free-space, two-way optical time transfer system compatible with global-scale synchronization of current-generation optical atomic clocks. In xxxxxx I, we have demonstrated the requisite performance using existing hardware coupled with off-the-shelf control electronics. xxxxxx on our results, we have designed a fully-integrated module capable of disseminating timing signals with sub-femtosecond error from 1-10,000 s. In xxxxxx, we will package the device and deliver it for external testing. Our system is expected to improve ground-to-satellite synchronization a million-fold over current RF-based time transfer systems, enabling applications including clock-based geodesy, very long baseline interferometry, coherent LIDAR arrays, and tests of general relativity.The xxxxxx I breadboard demonstration performance is consistent with a timing jitter of 3 fs @ 1s and integrates down to 700 as at 30 seconds. The corresponding fractional timing instability is 3 x 10^-15 @ 1 second, which flickers at 2.7 x 10^-17 out to 2000 seconds. We have identified the systematic effects that limit both short and long term stability and incorporated the improvements into the xxxxxx design. With these improvements, we expect a 10x improvement in both short and long terms stability of the system.In addition, we reviewed and formalized the laser driver and control electronics specifications. The initial schematic capture for critical analog sub sections was completed and a suitable FPGA/microprocessor combination was chosen to control the system and process the timing information. xxxxxx on these designs, power and size estimates were used to complete the mechanical enclosure model for the time-transfer system. For maximum flexibility in the final architecture of the overall free-space time transfer system, each frequency comb sub-unit that includes the laser and control electronics will be housed in a 1U rack mount enclosure.	13840
Venus Suface Sampling and Analysis	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	This effort is developing the technology to transfer particulate samples from a xxxxxx drill (being developed by xxxxxx in a xxxxxx 2 Small Business xxxxxxovative Rearch task) inside a lander pressure vessel and thermal barrier and to present them to instruments for analysis under xxxxxxlike temperature and low pressure environment. The overall objective of this task is to develop a xxxxxx surface sample acquisition and transfer system that can reliably provide particulate samples of sufficient quantity and presentation location for instruments located inside a lander to perform useful analysis. xxxxxxment priority was given to the high temperature, high pressure external functions and the transition element between external high-pressure, high-temperature conditions and the internal low-pressure, room-temperature conditions where the instruments would operate, because that is where most of the mission risk resides. Fortunately, JPL has partnered with xxxxxx on the xxxxxx lander mission and they have already developed prototypes of a rotary drill, electric actuators and a gear box that operate at high temperatures. xxxxxx has further matured their technology in this, the first of two years of a separate xxxxxx 2 xxxxxx task. The JPL strategy for this R&amp;TD proposal is to focus on component and subsystem technology development to provide the other required functions of the overall system. xxxxxxment in this sense consists of design, fabrication and successful testing of prototype hardware under a relevant environment (xxxxxx 5).&nbsp;The guiding philosophy of this effort has been to expand beyond the Soviet Venera sampling solution that was limited to a single sample from a single drill delivered to a single instrument in a lander resting on flat (&lt;10&deg; slope) terrain. In particular, there is a strong desire to be able to accommodate two instruments such as JPL&rsquo;s CIRS (a xxxxxx) and PIXL (an X-ray fluorescence instrument) for mineralogical and elemental abundance analyses, and to present the surface samples in a benign environment to minimize adaptation of these instruments for use at xxxxxx. We accepted this premise and made other assumptions in this task, understanding full well that mission trades may require ongoing adaptation of the sample system development as trades are closed and decisions made.The quantitative capability goal is that two particulate samples would be provided for analysis by two instruments either as soil/dirt from the surface or as cuttings created during the sample excavation process. The sample would be presented to the instruments in a sample cup of size &gt;2 cm in diameter and with a depth of &gt;0.1 mm given lander orientations of up to 20&deg; from horizontal. The sample measurement environment would be low temperature (notionally 30 &deg;C) and low pressure (&lt; 1 atm). It is assumed that one sample would be from the weathered surface material at a depth of 0-2 cm and the second from presumably unweathered material (if drilled from competent rock) at a depth of 2-4 cm. The sampling system will accommodate a wide range of surface material hardness from loose soil to basalt (7-8 on the Moh scale).	13841

CLEMENTINE HIRES MOSAIC	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	This CD contains portions of the xxxxxx xxxxxx, a geometrically controlled, calibrated mosaic compiled from non-uniformity corrected, 750 nanometer ('D') filter high resolution observations from the xxxxxx imaging system onboard the xxxxxx. These mosaics cover sub-polar regions between 80 deg S and 80 deg N with the sinusoidal equal area mapping at 20 m/pixel, and the polar regions above 80 deg with a stereographic mapping at 30 m/pixel resolution at the poles. The geometric control is provided by the 100 m/pixel USGS xxxxxx xxxxxx (PDS CD-ROM xxxxxx) compiled from the 750 nm xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx imaging system and, for the polar mosaics, from the 150 m/pixel polar basemap mosaic. xxxxxx was achieved by removing image nonuniformity largely due to the xxxxxx system's light intensifier. Also provided are offset and scale factors which transform the 8-bit xxxxxx data to approximate photometric units, achieved by a fit of the xxxxxx data to the corresponding UV/Vis basemap, which is photometrically calibrated.	13844
Diffraction Testing for the Beach Ball Coronagraph	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx #1: xxxxxx, both analytically and experimentally, the diffraction intensity around a spherical object as a function of distance. Two different diameter/distances will be used to determine a non-linear relationship between the diffraction intensity and occulter diameter/distance and see how these experimental results compare to theoretical ones. Also studied will be the effects of a conducting surface (metal) vs non-conductive (black paint or carbon nanotube). Each type of occulter will be place at different distances, including the ~2 m baseline for the FFBBC CubeSat design, in order to produce a curve that can be extrapolated to the hundreds of meters distance of the FFBBC xxxxxx version.&nbsp;xxxxxx #2: xxxxxx if diffraction around a sphere can be used as signal for inertial pointing.&nbsp; The FFBBC occulter will also occult, at least partially, any spacecraft fine xxxxxx sensor for long separations. The diffraction around a sphere also produces a bright, concentrated spot at the center of the spherical diffraction pattern and shadow referred to as xxxxxx&rsquo;s or Arago&rsquo;s Spot.&nbsp; The second goal, to be achieved using the same measurements addressing xxxxxx #1, is to measure the brightness and extent of this spot to see if it can be used to drive the guidance algorithm for inertial formation flying.&nbsp; This means the science CCD can double as the fine xxxxxx-sensor, again reducing multiple systems simplifying the mission design.	13845
3-COLOR MESSENGER MDIS MAP PROJECTED MULTISPECTRAL RDR V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	Abstract ======== The Mercury xxxxxx Imaging xxxxxx (MDIS) consists of two cameras, a Wide xxxxxxle Camera (WAC) and a Narrow xxxxxxle Camera (NAC), mounted on a common pivot platform. This dataset includes 3-xxxxxx xxxxxxspectral xxxxxxd xxxxxx Records for the WAC. The 3-xxxxxx Map Projected xxxxxxspectral xxxxxx (MD3) data set consists of a 3-color map of northern and equatorial latitudes acquired during MESSENGER's Extended Mission, and includes I/F in the 3 filters used for this map. This product has higher spatial resolution than, and complements, an 8-color multispectral map acquired during the primary mission. This product is photometrically normalized to a solar incidence angle (i) = 30 degrees, emission angle (e) = 0 degrees, and phase angle (g) = 30 degrees at a spatial sampling of 128 pixels per degree. The map is divided into 'tiles', each representing the NW, NE, SW, or SE quadrant of one of the 13 non-polar or one of the 2 polar quadrangles or 'Mercury charts' already defined by the USGS. Each tile is composed of 3 bands corresponding to 3 of the 11 WAC filters. Each tile also contains backplanes describing ancillary information. The subset of 3 of 11 available multispectral filters samples both albedo and spectral slope over MDIS's wavelength range. The fewer colors than in the Primary Mission 8-color product is to balance the higher spatial resolution to manage data volume during acquisition.	13846

Low Mass, Two-Phase Thermal Switch, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	Future human spacecraft will venture far beyond the relatively benign environment of low Earth orbit. They will transit through the deep space, but they may encounter warm transient environments such as low lunar orbit. Some spacecraft elements may be launched untended and would operate at relatively low power levels as they transit to their final destination. The combination of extreme environments and high turndown capability will be a major challenge for spacecraft thermal control systems.  Thermal switches are among the thermal control devices that are required and can dissipate a wide range of heat loads in widely varying environments while using fewer of the limited spacecraft mass, volume and power resources.  This xxxxxx project proposed by xxxxxx will develop a low mass and high conduction ratio two-phase thermal switch as a thermal control system component for human spacecraft. The proposed device could work in thermal switch regime or in variable conductance regime while the set point can be changed remotely.  A trade study will be conducted to define the three features of the low mass two-phase thermal switch and demonstrate the feasability of the concept.  A preliminary full scale prototype will be designed, fabricated and tested at the end of the xxxxxx I program.	13849
Doppler Lidar for Measurement of High-Altitude Aircraft Wake Vortices	2013-01-01	2018-07-19	We are developing a xxxxxx lidar technology for detecting and measuring wake vortices of aircraft. This lidar has been largely developed for meteorological applications, and we are exploring its adaptation to use in this aeronautics application. Wake vortex considerations are important in preventing harmful turbulence encounters in our nation's airspace.While ground-based xxxxxx lidar has been used to probe wakes of landing aircraft for many years, these lidars are of a low pulse energy (a few millijoules) that limits their use to short ranges and low altitudes within the atmospheric boundary layer. With xxxxxx advancement of high pulse energy (250-millijoules) lidar, aircraft wakes could now be measured at long ranges and high altitudes. A ground-based lidar could be used to measure wakes of overflying aircraft to altitudes as high at 20,000 feet. Furthermore, the high-energy lidar could be installed in an aircraft to measure the wakes of other aircraft in flight. The Airspace xxxxxxs Program (ASP) is committed to the development of Super Density Operations (SDO) concepts for xxxxxx. Wake vortices are a fundamental physical limitation that will need to be resolved to enable these SDOs. Understanding wake vortices is a crucial step in the path to xxxxxx. Under ASP, xxxxxx wake vortex prediction model development is world-class and is actively involved in both development and validation of these wake models. Access to previously unavailable enroute wake data that would result from this effort represents a huge opportunity to help enable the xxxxxx goals by providing the ability to conduct robust model validation critical to enabling SDO concepts. To start the development of measuring aircraft wakes from a distant location, we are having an aircraft fly over the lidar in such a way that the aircraft's wakes will drift over the lidar's beam. By placing the target wakes at a known location, we will capture the signal's indicative of a wake vortex. An automated algorithm could then be developed to automatically scan for and lock onto a wake vortex signature. We are also making preliminary designs of adapting the lidar's operation in an aircraft for currently-used meteorological wind measurements to wake vortex measurements. These changes are in the scan pattern of the lidar beam and signal processing.	13850

High-Resolution Gamma-Ray Detection Using Phonon-Mediated Detection	2016-03-01	2018-07-19	The recent breakthroughs in hard X-ray/soft gamma-ray optics, as characterized by the xxxxxx (2011 launch) and NEXT (2013 launch) missions, have finally opened up the 10- 100 keV band to detailed astronomical observation. Nuclear spectroscopic techniques at these energies allow for further study of the dynamics of supernovae, a poorly understood phenomenon of great scientific relevance. Such a study would require an energy resolution of roughly 100 eV at 70 keV or 0.1%. The current state-of-the art in focal plane detectors, such as the xxxxxx detectors on xxxxxx, have a FWHM resolution of around 1 keV at 70 keV. I propose to develop new type of focal plane to recover this order of magnitude in sensitivity. The device will be an athermal phonon-mediated detector that uses the microwave kinetic inductance detector (xxxxxx) technology currently being developed by JPL (xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and xxxxxx) and Caltech (xxxxxx and xxxxxx). It will use a 2 mm thick Ge substrate to stop the gammas, and convert their energy to athermal phonons. These phonons travel in straight lines, preserving information about the interaction point. They would then be detected by xxxxxxS deposited on the surface of the substrate. We have fabricated a proof-of-concept, which has demonstrated an energy resolution of sigma = 1.16 keV at 30 keV.	13854
Energy Efficient LED Spectrally Matched Smart Lighting, Phase II	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxovative Imaging and xxxxxxearch and the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx Clear Lake have teamed to develop a widely extensible, affordable, energy efficient, smart lighting device known as xxxxxx-Net.  Smart building technologies, such as xxxxxx-Net, are becoming critical to energy savings and sustainability for terrestrial applications and space-based habitats.  Our device incorporates a smart-mobile device or other comparable sized integrated computing/sensing device into each LED fixture. Smart-mobile devices are ideally suited to perform energy saving lighting control as they contain inexpensive, mass produced, highly integrated imaging, computing and communication technologies. The low cost digital cameras within these packages become highly capable imaging photosensors using calibration techniques developed for xxxxxx satellites and the commercial remote sensing industry. Novel algorithms utilize lighting information measured by the photosensors to individually tailor the intensity and spectral content of the light generated from each LED fixture within the lighting system to reduce energy usage, increase lighting efficacy and improve circadian rhythm influenced activities such as sleeping and concentration.  xxxxxxanced spatially distributed occupancy sensing and lighting control further reduces energy usage.  xxxxxxting sensing and computing into each light fixture also provides the infrastructure to create a robust sensor network. xxxxxx communication is achieved through Wi-Fi, xxxxxx and other communication means, such as the power lines that provide electricity to each fixture. This resulting sensor network enables a wide range of terrestrial and space-based applications including monitoring: building/habitat temperature, humidity and air quality; occupant health and safety; building/habitat space utilization and astronaut activity including deep space adaptation in addition to providing high quality spatially selectable, spectrally programmable illumination.	13855

TDA xxxxxxearch, xxxxxx. proposes to develop a durable, high-capacity, continuously regenerable sorbent that can remove xxxxxx from the breathing loop.  The energy for regeneration is provided by the metabolic load, and the  sorbent can be regenerated at or above 6 torr, eliminating the potential for xxxxxx atmosphere to leak into the regeneration bed and into the breathing loop. In xxxxxx I, we demonstrated the feasibility of the concept in a series of bench-scale experiments and by conducting a preliminary system analysis. We showed the sorbent regeneration can be accomplished with a temperature swing of only 17ºC, The entire system runs at near ambient temperature, and the sorbent can be regenerated at 13 torr (well above the xxxxxx atmospheric pressure). We also performed over 1,000 adsorption/regeneration cycles to demonstrate the life of these sorbents. The major objective in xxxxxx is to design and fabricate a full-scale breadboard prototype unit to demonstrate the merits of the new technology. We will also improve the sorbent formulation.	13856

TBO-AID: Trajectory-Based Operations Adaptive Information Display, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx-based operations (TBO) are at the forefront of the Next xxxxxxration Air Traffic Management xxxxxx (xxxxxx). The vision of xxxxxx is one in which pilots will be responsible for following 4-dimensional (4D) trajectories while maintaining separation from other aircraft and weather. Ongoing research focuses heavily on the infrastructure and procedures required to conduct 4D TBO; however, new flight deck displays are going to be needed to support pilots who will be faced with the challenge of making more complex, strategic decisions than are required in current-day operations. In response to this challenge, xxxxxx proposes to develop a xxxxxx-xxxxxx Operations xxxxxxive Information Display (TBO-AID). TBO-AID will incorporate innovative display techniques that address the (1) unique information needs associated with conducting 4D operations (e.g., crossing a specific navigation fix at a specific time); (2) uncertainty and risk associated with weather and mixed-equipage conditions, key challenges for conducting 4D TBO; (3) potential advantages gained through multimodal information presentation; and (4) need for model-based, situationally aware display adaptation to support information processing and decision making. xxxxxx results of commercializing this effort include increasing the safety and efficiency of air traffic and expanding the maximum number of aircraft potentially in flight at a given time.	13858

Led byxxxxxx xxxxxx (SSC), the observation of metal atom emissionfrom liquid rocket engine exhausts at sea level conditions has become ahighly successful health monitoring technique, but in altitude testsemission intensities are low.  SSC developed an atomic absorption systemwhich has provided useful measurements, but improved sensitivity isrequired.  Non-dispersive atomic absorption presents a far simpler,smaller, lower cost alternative to other techniques with comparablespectral resolution and, of particular importance, should allow a moreforgiving receiver geometry, so that noise-modulated source light orplume emission can be eliminated.	13862

Regenerators for Liquid Hydrogen Cryocoolers, Phase II	2012-02-01	2018-07-19	Future xxxxxx exloration, planetary and astrophysics missions will require various enhancements in multi-stage cryocoolers. These include increased efficiency, reduced vibration and reductions in overall system mass and power consumption. For the small coolers required, pulse tube and xxxxxx coolers offer the best opportunities. At present, the efficiency of these coolers is limited by the effectiveness of low-temperature-stage regenerators. xxxxxx about 60 K, two factors play key roles in reducing the effectiveness of regenerators. One is that the heat capacity of most materials falls rapidly with decreasing temperature, thereby, severely limiting the number of useful materials to a few in common use. A second factor is that these commonly used materials are only available in powder form, a form known to raise reliability issues. In this effort, we will address both factors. We will use newly developed materials with high heat capacities at temperatures below 80 K, higher than that of commonly used materials. Further, we will develop novel low-temperature regenerator matrix configurations that will address both the aspect of high-efficiency and regenerator durability. Both the void fracton and the ratio of surface area to solid fracton of the regenerator matrix will be varied to achieve high efficiency.	13866

Fault Management Technologies, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	Given that SysML is becoming a standard for model-based systems engineering and xxxxxxtion (SE&I), system health management (SHM)-related models will either be done in SysML, or be done outside of SysML but enabled by conversion, mapping, and traceability of information across SysML and SHM models. Given that current implementations of SysML are not particularly useful to perform analyses, and that SHM analyses are not identical to typical SE&I-related analyses, there will need to be connectivity between SysML representations and SHM models that perform SHM-related analyses.Qualtech xxxxxxs, xxxxxx. (QSI), with Dr. xxxxxx as a consultant intends to explore and develop the integration of model-based systems engineering and xxxxxxtion (SE&I) using SysML with system health management (SHM) modeling and analysis using QSI's Testability xxxxxxing and xxxxxx xxxxxx (TEAMS).

This is one step in the larger set of issues that will need to be addressed in the development of the model-based xxxxxx of xxxxxxs xxxxxxing and its concurrent integration with SHM to achieve higher-quality designs while reducing the costs of SE&I.	13871
A Dropsonde UAV for Atmospheric Sensing in a Turbulent Environment, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxs are one of the primary atmospheric measurement tools available to researchers.  Current dropsondes are deployed with a free fall parachute trajectory, allowing no flight path control and requiring the deployment aircraft to fly close to the target.  Adding an extended, guided range capability to the dropsonde will allow much greater mission flexibility by providing significant geographic and temporal coverage of areas of interest.  Barron Associates, xxxxxx. will accomplish this through an innovative winged dropsonde that launches from a regular dropsonde launch tube, and deploys wing and tail control surfaces, and a propeller, starts the engine, and executes the mission under horizontal, powered flight.

The vehicle will also be equipped with gas sensors, a custom autopilot board and a long-range telemetry system.  High-turbulence operation is highly desirable and a portion of the xxxxxx I effort will go towards researching the vehicle configuration and software enhancements necessary to support operations in a highly turbulent environment.  The end result of the xxxxxx I will be a flight tested, long-endurance, guided dropsonde vehicle, and a feasible xxxxxx plan for enhancing the vehicle to support high-turbulent operations, allowing use for hurricane, volcanic plume, and wildfire atmospheric science.	13872

Data Reduction and Rapid Analysis of Hyperspectral Data Sets, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	Hyperspectral sensors offer great opportunities for increasingly sensitive automated target recognition (xxxxxx) systems though a common problem is the lack of sufficient training data.  Also, the inherent high dimensionality of hyperspectral signatures requires the design of a hyperspectral xxxxxx to have a large number of training samples.  This is due to the fact that the number of training samples required is directly related to the dimensionality of the classifier.  In order to avoid this problem, the hyperspectral datasets must be preprocessed, thereby reducing the dimensionality to an acceptable level.  Other challenges include uncertainty associated with measurements and missing/sparse data sets.  To meet these challenges, the PERL xxxxxxearch and xxxxxx State xxxxxxersity will develop a unique xxxxxx system for data reduction and rapid analysis of hyperspectral data.  Our proposed approach is based on the integration of two concepts:  localized discriminant bases and support vector machines.  Our proposed xxxxxx system will be able to rapidly cope with limited/sparse training data while producing optimal target recognition accuracies.  Furthermore, the xxxxxx will provide a unique capability for easy integration with various sensors and other xxxxxx systems.	13884

Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) IV Pathfinder	2017-02-01	2018-07-19	The Clean Air Act mandates xxxxxx to monitor stratospheric ozone, and stratospheric aerosol measurements are vital to our understanding of climate.&nbsp; xxxxxxtaining reliable long-term measurements will require increasing access to and reducing the cost of frequent spaceborne missions.&nbsp; xxxxxxver, the best measurements have been and continue to be delivered via expensive, single instruments (e.g., xxxxxx&nbsp;II, xxxxxx&nbsp;xxxxxx&nbsp;M3M, and xxxxxx&nbsp;xxxxxx&nbsp;xxxxxx launched in 2017) deployed onboard large, heavy platforms.&nbsp; Instead, a constellation of relatively inexpensive xxxxxx&nbsp;IV sensorcraft can maintain the stratospheric ozone record and provide critical measurements of stratospheric aerosol and other trace gases.A solar occultation imager in a small form factor can provide high-quality science at a small fraction of the cost and even improve data quality in the upper troposphere&nbsp;/&nbsp;lower stratosphere.&nbsp; The imaging technique intrinsically eliminates all of the major technological and algorithmic challenges of previous solar occultation instruments, yet to date there has not been a radiometric solar occultation imager. &nbsp;The xxxxxx&nbsp;IV system design enables continuous on-orbit characterization of instrument behavior and performance.&nbsp; The majority of hardware is commercially available, and the entire payload can fit inside a 6U CubeSat.&nbsp; Current technology limits telemetered data volume from a CubeSat, but embedded control algorithms will be developed to ensure all raw science data is retained and transmitted.The xxxxxx&nbsp;IV xxxxxxfinder started out as an Internal xxxxxxearch and xxxxxxment (IRAD) project at xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx in xxxxxx, xxxxxx and was successfully infused into the xxxxxx xxxxxxent xxxxxxubator Program (IIP) under the xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Office. &nbsp;Under IRAD, detailed design and analysis were&nbsp;performed to ensure viability and future success of the instrument and mission concepts. &nbsp;The xxxxxx&nbsp;IV xxxxxxfinder IIP will build and test a ground demonstration unit over the next three years and is the first stepping stone to a future on-orbit mission.	13886

Deep UV Raman/Fluorescence (DUV-RF) Stand-off sensor for Lunar Science, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	This proposal enables development a miniature, low power consumption, fused deep UV xxxxxx and native fluorescence (DUV-RF) stand-off sensor. The proposed fused instrument has the ability to measure the spatial distribution of chemical species containing C, N, H, O, S, Cl, and/or water, ice, and hydrated minerals on a 1-5 mm spatial scale enabled by a novel set of wide aperture, high sensitivity ultraminiature deep UV xxxxxx spectrometers. xxxxxx spectroscopy is a non-contact, non-destructive, method of identifying unknown materials without the need for sample acquisition and processing. This technique is ideal for in situ exploration from extraterrestrial xxxxxx or landers. There are three main advantages of deep UV xxxxxx methods over near-UV, visible or near-IR counterparts.  1) xxxxxx-law: signal enhancement of 20x at 248nm compared to excitation at 532nm. 2) xxxxxxonance: much higher signal enhancements; for water 5 times greater than xxxxxx-law enhancement alone, for a combined effect over 120x between 248 nm and 532 nm.  3) With excitation below 250nm, xxxxxx scattering bands occur in a fluorescence-free region of the spectrum.  At longer excitation wavelengths fluorescence from target or surrounding materials overwhelm xxxxxx emissions and require gating with high power lasers with narrow pulse widths leading to sample alteration/damage. When deep UV xxxxxx is combined with native fluorescence, it becomes possible to characterize mineral alterations and detect trapped chemicals with exquisite sensitivity and differentiability. The xxxxxx has placed a South pole-xxxxxx sample return as a future mission scenario. Using the enhanced detection capabilities of DUV-RF, water, ice and chemical species can be detected and mapped to provide an understanding of their distribution in the lunar regolith.	13888
Fault Management: Degradation Signature Detection, Modeling, and Processing, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx to Failure xxxxxxion (FFP) signature modeling and processing is a new method for applying condition-based signal data to detect degradation, to identify fault modes, and to produce system estimates for State of Health (SoH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL). The base technology has been applied for prognostic purposes for various government-sponsored programs, but FFP signature modeling and processing has not been applied for the area of xxxxxx, nor does it include such features as fault dictionaries, lookup tables, and management algorithms. The technology includes xxxxxx-designed and developed algorithms to do the following: (1) perform xxxxxx to reduce noise; (2) transform sensor signal data to reveal underlying (hidden) FFP signatures; (3) normalize units-of-measure dependent signal data into dimensionless FFP signatures to facilitate re-use and reduce the time to characterize and define new FFP signatures; (4) define and use model definitions that reduce memory requirements and support fast and accurate processing and calculations; (5) two forms of trajectory curve characterization, both straight-line and curvilinear; (6) a fast yet accurate, graphics-based mathematical routine to adapt an FFP model to received data; (7) amplitude and time updates similar to Extended xxxxxx to estimate how long it will take an adapted FFP model to reach a defined failure threshold; and (8) produce SoH and RUL estimates that rapidly converge to the estimated time-to-failure (TTF) solution. The FFP signature modeling and processing will include additional innovation to support FM to minimize application-specific programming, those include algorithms to simplify fault identification and isolation.	13889

Realizing Practical Nitinol Locomotion	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx motors and solenoids use coils of conductive wire to generate electrically driven magnetic motion, and pneumatic driven solenoids have been used for producing motion from fluidic pressures. Present day Nitinol memory alloys have opened new possibilities to create locomotion via solid state actuators. This technology offers innovative approaches to address the energy conversion technological topics in xxxxxx under the TA03.01 Energy Harvesting xxxxxx xxxxxxment xxxxxx. Nitinol wires are unique nickel-titanium alloys that shorten in length when heated; they expand and contract because of the combination of nickel and titanium crystalline structures. &nbsp;Nitinol wire is much stronger than an average strand of wire, is capable of doing more work with less energy, is easy to use, small in size, operates silently, lightweight, and is easily activated using AC or DC power. In 1973, Nitinol was used to create the first solid state heat engine, and memory alloys currently have the potential to considerably change thermal energy conversion technology. xxxxxxver, contraction readily occurs when electrical excitation rapidly heats the Nitinol material, but expansion, which occurs when the material is cooled, is more difficult to rapidly achieve. xxxxxx is still a technological challenge that needs to be overcome in order to optimize utility of this technology. xxxxxxing and employing xxxxxxstatic Fluid Acceleration (EFA) techniques for advancing the controllability of Nitinol materials will unlock the potential of the Nitinol material for practical deployment applications. In addition to energy conversion, this kind of device also potentially has practical applicability for accessing and transporting hardware components used throughout the ground propulsion test facilities which in turn, would reduce operational costs.&nbsp;This project will demonstrate advancements in the technology&rsquo;s practicality by using low levels of electrical power to move significant objects in order to avoid the added complications with energy harvesting devices.&nbsp; A lightweight power efficient miniaturized crawler for retrieving and shelving stored items via an advanced Nitinol wire locomotion device utilizing a novel cooling mechanism will be developed and constructed. The system will be designed and built to demonstrate practical locomotion from the novel Nitinol control apparatus. Nitinol wires shorten in length when heated.&nbsp;The wire accomplishes 5% contraction of its full length by becoming expandable when cooled, and stiffening back into its original length when heated. xxxxxxanced cooling, for expansion, will be achieved through EFA technologies.&nbsp; EFA has experimentally exhibited an ability to alter the boundary layer along a fixed surface for achieving increased thermal transfer or thermal isolation. The crawler mechanism will be constructed from two Nitinol controlled latching levers with an interconnecting Nitinol controlled linear actuator to produce a caterpillar-like locomotion.&nbsp; The unit will traverse structures made from aluminum x-rails with a Nitinol grabber capable of maneuvering large heavy objects onto shelving. The Nitinol actuation devices will be energized with an electrostatic field for increasing air flow to enhance cooling into nearby thermal sinks for increased control capability.&nbsp; Future iterations could expand the development to create supplementary power generation, new Nitinol engines, and for scaling-up the crawler to enable maneuvering on test hardware.	13891
Nitrous Ethane-Ethylene Rocket with Hypergolic Ignition, Phase II	2018-04-01	2018-07-19	The Nitrous Ethane-xxxxxx xxxxxx with Hypergolic Ignition (xxxxxx) engine is a proposed technology designed to provide small spacecraft with non-toxic, non-cryogenic, high performance, hypergolic propulsion. When passed over a warm catalyst bed, gaseous nitrous oxide and an ethylene-ethane gaseous blend combust instantly. A small 1 N thruster can be designed to provide small satellite propulsion systems with a specific impulse of approximately 300 seconds. Both propellants are self-pressurizing, capable of delivering feed line pressures in excess of 800 psi at room temperature, and 400 psi if cooled to 0?C. For longer duration missions, both nitrous oxide and an ethane-ethylene fuel blend do not require thermal heating to maintain a liquid state, and as such, can be stored on Earth or in space for in-definite periods of time with no parasitic power drain required to maintain a liquid propellant. Compared to other available chemical propulsion systems, a xxxxxx system offers a cost effective solution as other hypergolic engines use hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide which are toxic and dangerous to handle, increasing ground costs. As an added capability, the xxxxxx engine has the ability to operate as a monopropellant engine if the catalyst be is heated with a bipropellant reaction, increasing the lifetime of the catalyst bed and reducing heating loads on the engine. The fuel and oxidizer have nearly identical vapor pressure curves, allowing them to be stored in compact common-bulkhead tanks.	13892
Autonomous Navigation for Exploration on Icy Moons	2018-01-01	2018-07-19	The proposed program develops novel sensing, perceptual models, and energy-efficient exploration strategies to enable mobile autonomous systems to explore icy moons and identify high value science targets. The research program will yield: (1) a novel active illumination sensor that can selectively image certain types of light paths while blocking others with the capability to scan optically challenging materials such as ice; (2) a probabilistic sensor model that accurately captures sensor measurements and incorporates intensity, depth, and material information; and (3) an energy-efficient motion planning framework that yields maximally informative and energy efficient trajectories that generalize across multiple mobility platforms. xxxxxxtive experiments will validate the developments at sites in xxxxxx that exhibit similar characteristics as the anticipated craggy, icy environments.

Marine ASV Range Surveillance System, Phase II	2012-01-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx spaceports carry out the critical task of launching and recovering vehicles and payloads. These are extremely unique and expensive assets, and their successful deployment, operation, and recovery are essential to our nation's scientific discovery, economic prosperity, and national security.  xxxxxx and weather monitoring are significant factors in enabling safe, secure, reliable, and cost effective operations.  xxxxxx encompass large marine regions that are expensive to monitor and not under the exclusive control of the spaceport.  xxxxxx regions include backwater areas (lagoon, river, and estuary) near the launch site, as well as the coastal and open-ocean regions extending hundreds of miles downrange.  The most hazardous regions must be cleared and maintained clear in preparation for launch and reentry operations to ensure public safety as well as the safety and security of the vehicle itself.

Shot peening is widely used on PM disks to provide a fatigue benefit however, the relaxation due to thermal and mechanical loads can reduce or even eliminate the compressive residual stresses and increase the risk of a catastrophic disk failure. Up to now the evolution of the residual stress and cold work under typical operating conditions in PM disk superalloys is not well understood.In xxxxxx I proprietary x-ray diffraction (xxxxxx) techniques will be used to simultaneously measure the change in residual stress and cold work for fatigue specimens tested in a manner to approximate in-service conditions. xxxxxx residual stress and cold work results will be used to establish the feasibility of applying analytical or empirically based modeling techniques to predict the residual stress and cold work evolution. The modeling technique will first be demonstrated on fatigue samples and further developed and proven on actual disk hardware in xxxxxx.

Additive Friction Stir Deposition of Aluminum Alloys and Functionally Graded Structures, Phase II	2016-06-01	2018-07-19	State-of-the-art additive manufacturing technologies for metal parts have evolved primarily around powder metallurgy and fusion welding-based processes.  These processing methodologies yield parts with inferior mechanical and physical properties as compared to wrought metal of the same composition.  Additionally, the production rates for even the fastest processes are relatively low, the part envelopes are limited to a few cubic feet, and often the process must be conducted in an atmospherically controlled chamber.  xxxxxx's additive friction stir (xxxxxx) process is a novel high-speed, large-volume wrought metal additive manufacturing technology that will enable affordable, full-density, near net-shape component manufacturing from a wide range of alloys, including aerospace aluminum alloys, nickel-based super alloys, and metal matrix composites.  The ability to rapidly fabricate large-scale, complex wrought and functionally graded aluminum components from three-dimensional models will be an enabling manufacturing advancement in exploration launch vehicle fabrication, for parts such as those on the xxxxxxn xxxxxx xxxxxx. A scaled representation of the window frame structure proposed for the xxxxxxn xxxxxx xxxxxx was fabricated from 6061 Al using xxxxxx's additive friction stir process during the xxxxxx I program.  To move xxxxxx up the xxxxxx ladder to full-scale demonstration and deployment, two major technical objectives must be met: (1) develop process/structure/property relationships for xxxxxx deposition of aluminum aerospace alloys, such as 2219, which can be used for process control and material property optimization; and (2) demonstrate net-shape, large-scale aluminum launch vehicle and aerospace components (including a functionally graded structure) with mechanical properties comparable to traditional wrought metals.	13901

Electrical Conductivity of Rocks and Dominant Charge Carriers:  The Paradox of Thermally Activated Positive Holes	2013-05-07	2018-07-19	In this paper we have focused on fundamental processes that are important for understanding the electrical properties of materials, both single crystal minerals and igneous rocks, both laboratory-grown and from natural environments.  The prevailing view in the geophysics community is that the electrical conductivity structure of the xxxxxx continental crust over the 5-35 km depth range can best be understood by assuming the presence of intergranular fluids and/or intergranular carbon films. xxxxxx on studies of melt-grown xxxxxx, magma-derived sanidine and anorthosite feldspar and upper mantle olivine single crystal we present evidence for the presence of electronic charge carriers, the importance of which has been largely ignored. These charge carriers derive from peroxy defects, which are introduced during cooling, under non-equilibrium conditions, through a redox conversion of pairs of solute OH– arising from the solid state dissolution of xxxxxx  It can be shown that, during reheating, the peroxy defects become thermally activated in a 2-step process. xxxxxx 2 leads to the release of defect electrons in the oxygen anion sublattice. Known as positive holes and symbolized by h•, these electronic charge carriers are associated with energy states at the upper edge of the valence band. They are highly mobile.  Chemically equivalent to O– in a matrix of O2– they are highly oxidizing. xxxxxxver, though metastable, the h• can exist in minerals, which crystallized in highly reduced environments. The h• appear to control the electrical conductivity of crustal rocks over much of the 5-35 km depth range. We make the extraordinary and seemingly paradoxial claim that xxxxxx crystals, grown from the melt under the viciously reducing conditions of a carbon arc fusion furnace, contain peroxy defects in their crystal structure, hence oxygen in the valence state xxxxxx  When the peroxy defects break up, they release positive hole charge carriers, formally defect electron in the oxygen anion sublattice, equivalent to O– in a matrix of O2–.  These positive holes have two outstanding properties: they are highly mobile and highly oxidizing.	13908

Holographic Optical Element-Based Laser Diode Source, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx is seeking improved methods of rapid prototyping, which are best achieved by using directed metal deposition (DMD).  Current DMD systems consume a great deal of power, are inefficient, require significant flow of cooling water, and are fixed in one location.  To address the need for a rapid prototyping DMD laser, xxxxxxical xxxxxxics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new holographic optical element-based laser diode source (HOELDS) to replace conventional DMD lasers.  The proposed laser source is an innovative combination of extended laser diode arrays with a non-imaging beam combiner to produce over 500 W output in a 100 micron diameter spot.  HOELDS will greatly increase efficiency, resulting in a less expensive prototyping system that can be moved from laboratory to laboratory as needed, requiring only wall plug power, and cooled without water.  In xxxxxx I, POC will design, assemble, and test a HOELDS model to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology.

Bidirectional Dual Active Bridge Power Converter for Spacecraft Power Systems, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	A bidirectional dual active bridge (DAB) dc-dc converter for electrical power systems (xxxxxx) is proposed. The converter operates as a charger, upconverter, and downconverter using a single transformer. The converter uses smart technology to interleave DAB converter stages for ripple current reduction and optimized load sharing of stages to extend the high efficiency load range of the converter to 6.25% of full load. By using smart technology, the load condition of each DAB converter stage is monitored and its load sharing controlled depending on the converters total load condition. In this way, each converter stage is kept at or above 25% load. Therefore the minimum load of the new DAB converter with four interleaved stages is one fourth of 25% or 6.25%.

P12 V RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM RESAMPLED LOS GRAVITY V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	xxxxxx of sight (LOS) gravity data were obtained as part of the Radio xxxxxx Experiment by tracking 351 orbits of the xxxxxx xxxxxx. The data set consists of a table with the following columns: spacecraft latitude, longitude (degrees), accelerations, and altitude (km). The acceleration data were determined from differentiation of raw xxxxxx residuals and are expressed as units of mm/s**2. To obtain LOS gravity in milligals, accelerations need to be multiplied by 100. An acceleration of 1.20 mm/s**2, therefore, corresponds to 120 mgal, a large gravity anomaly.	13919
Reagent-Free Compact Online TOC Sensor, Phase II	2011-12-01	2018-07-19	A priority in Environmental Control and Life Support systems for extended space missions is to recover and process wastewater to provide potable water for crew consumption and oxygen generation. Total organic carbon (TOC) indicates the overall quality of reclaimed and stored water and their suitability for crew consumption by indicating the potential presence of hazardous chemicals. For extended missions, water monitoring requires reliable, real-time, online sensors, with limited or no need for resupplied chemicals, and low equivalent system mass (ESM). The goal of this project is to develop a reliable, compact, flight-qualifiable, microgravity-compatible, TOC analyzer (TOCA) for online, real-time water monitoring with an operational lifetime of 5 years with no need to resupply chemicals or water. xxxxxx components include an electrochemical unit that eliminates the need to resupply or store chemicals, an effective oxidation processor for TOC conversion to carbon dioxide, a compact, stable inorganic carbon sensing unit, and mesofluidic design for reduced ESM. During xxxxxx I, Lynntech successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed system by designing, fabricating, and testing both the critical components and an integrated breadboard TOCA. During xxxxxx, an optimized, reliable, compact, flight-qualifiable, microgravity-compatible TOCA prototype will be designed, fabricated, tested, and delivered to xxxxxx.	13920

RSPF-based Prognosis Framework for Estimation of Remaining Useful Life in Energy Storage Devices	2013-04-10	2018-07-19	This paper presents a case study where a RSPF-based prognosis framework is applied to estimate the remaining useful life of an energy storage device (xxxxxx battery). A comparison based on prognosis performance metrics indicates that the RSPF-based prognostic approach is more suitable than classic PF methods to represent rare events such as capacity regeneration phenomena between charging periods, in terms of accuracy of the state estimate and steadiness of the RUL estimate. We surmise that the existence of particles in the tails of the state pdf allow the RSPF-based prognostic algorithm to generally provide a more conservative estimate of the RUL of the faulty piece of equipment. We surmise that it also helps to incorporate the probability of rare and costly events in the evolution of the fault condition in time.	13922
HyDE Enhancements for ISHM Deployment, Phase II	2011-05-01	2018-07-19	Impact Technologies LLC, with the support of xxxxxx xxxxxx (PARC), proposes to continue developing key enhancements to xxxxxx Hybrid xxxxxx Engine (HyDE) that represent valuable and, in some cases, critical features for xxxxxxted xxxxxx Health Management (ISHM) developers in xxxxxx and non-xxxxxx application domains.  Specifically, the proposed program will be focused on attaining three milestones.  The first goal is to achieve commercial-grade readiness of a HyDE xxxxxxers Pack (HyDE DP) to xxxxxx 6 or higher.  To facilitate xxxxxx transition, the second program goal is deploying HyDE DP to xxxxxx (KSC) xxxxxxted xxxxxx xxxxxx in support of the Constellation Program.  Finally, to facilitate xxxxxx commercial transition and dramatically improved the embedded capability of HyDE, preparation for Beta-site deployment and tech transition with PARC on a commercial printing platform will be performed.  xxxxxxing off the significant xxxxxx I xxxxxx accomplishments, the Impact team believes that the proposed xxxxxx program is the ideal mix of innovative development work in the form of modeling, simulation, validation and verification tools for HyDE DP and tech transition activities designed to position HyDE as the diagnostic and reasoning engine for a broad application space that spans xxxxxx, commercial and military domains.	13923
Simulation-Based Tool for Traffic Management Training, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	Both the current NAS, as well as xxxxxx, need successful use of advanced tools. Successful training is required today because more information gathering and decision making must be done manually, which requires training in the fundamental principles and objectives of traffic management. Successful training is required in xxxxxx due to the increased reliance on automation.Given the multitude of input channels and actors that must be included in an environment for comprehensive training of Traffic Management xxxxxxs (TMCs), it would be too costly and too complex to attempt a full-scale human-in-the-loop simulation or table-top exercise that includes the direct participation of all of these entities. In xxxxxx I of this research, we studied and prototyped effective techniques and technologies to allow virtual and/or constructive simulation of key components of the TMC's environment to achieve a significant step forward in the state of the art of TMC training. In xxxxxx, we will conduct further research on Traffic Management (TM) training techniques and create a more comprehensive prototype system for evaluation. The proposed innovation and focus on this research is called the COMprehensive Environment for TM Training by Simulation (COMETTS).xxxxxx recent research thrust in the Shadow Mode Assessment using Realistic Technologies for xxxxxx xxxxxx (SMART NAS) xxxxxx provides an important step toward, and platform for, research in simulation-based training for the controller and TMC workforce. Such research holds the potential to significantly improve the transition of technologies from xxxxxx to the FAA and onward to fully successful implementation and acceptance by the end users. This proposed effort will leverage SMART NAS to conduct research, development, prototyping and evaluation of advanced simulation-based TMC training.	13924
Evaluating the Impact of Design-Driven Requirements Using SysML	2018-08-01	2018-07-19	The proposed research will develop SysML requirements modeling patterns and scripts to automate the evaluation of the impact of design driven requirements. Specifically, the research will develop a SysML requirements modeling pattern to model design-driven requirements, develop a script to integrate design-driven requirements into a SysML requirements tree within a trade study context to facilitate comparison of options, and develop a script to detect when conflicts exist between requirements or between requirements and the design. An important challenge in mid-lifecycle systems engineering is managing the balance between design capabilities and constraints and requirements. The design must fulfill all its requirements while accomplishing its mission goals. When unexpected requirement violations are found late in the design process, the chosen design solution must be evaluated against all existing requirements to ensure that an unrelated requirement has not been violated. Additionally, design decisions may impose new requirements. These new requirements must also be checked against all existing requirements and the design to ensure that there are no violations. With document-based methods, there is no explicit methodology for detecting when new requirements should be added to the requirements tree based on a design decision. The systems engineering or cognizant engineer must manually develop the implications of each design decision and decide if requirements should be added. In the V-model, there is an assumption that no new requirements will need to be added after design work has begun.On real projects, design choices frequently force changes of requirements causing rework and cost increases. These feedback relationships are difficult to track with traditional document-based methods due to their conditional nature and the cascading nature of changes in an integrated system. xxxxxxver, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) techniques and specifically SysML are able to model these relationships. Through successful development of the proposed capabilities, systems engineers can be confident that the implications of design decisions made late in the design cycle have been fully accounted for and projects will be able to make more reliable cost and schedule estimations.	13925
Multi-Fidelity Modeling and Simulation for the Analysis of Deployable Re-Entry Technologies Under Uncertainty	2021-09-01	2018-07-19	The objective of the proposed research will be to identify and validate multi-fidelity modeling methods for the modeling and simulation of the flow field and thermal response of ADEPT and HIAD deployable re-entry technologies, and to implement these tools in the analysis and design of the two technologies under uncertainty. The proposed research will also compare the performance and reliability of ADEPT and the HIAD concepts for similar missions and corresponding re-entry trajectories subject to uncertainties in the operating (free-stream) conditions, geometry, and the physical modeling parameters. Due to the significant amount of aeroheating, re-entry system designs need to be robust and reliable. High-fidelity computational fluid dynamics and thermal response simulations can be computationally very expensive due to the complex physics seen at these flow regimes (turbulence modeling, non-equilibrium thermo-chemistry, radiation heat transfer, etc.) and may not be practical for direct use in the design and reliability assessment of re-entry technologies under uncertainty because of the large number of simulations required. The main idea behind multi-fidelity modeling is to combine a large number of data points from low and mid-fidelity models with a small number of data points from the high-fidelity models in a way that obtains a corrected model which maintains the accuracy of the high-fidelity model while reducing the computational cost. The key research components of the proposed project will include: (1) investigation of multi-fidelity approaches suitable for the problem, (2) integration of multi-fidelity modeling into an uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework, (3) comparison of the performance and reliability of HIAD and ADEPT configurations under uncertainty, and (4) investigation of multi-fidelity modeling for design optimization of deployable re-entry technologies under uncertainty. Component 1 includes an investigation into which low-, mid-, and high-fidelity computational tools should be used to create accurate multi-fidelity models for different output quantities of interest such as the surface pressure, shear, convective, and radiation heat flux. This component will also involve an investigation into the different types of multi-fidelity analysis including co-xxxxxx, polynomial chaos expansion, and support vector analysis. In component 2, the multi-fidelity modeling techniques will be integrated into a UQ framework in order to perform reliability analyses of ADEPT and HIAD configurations. In component 3, with multi-fidelity analysis and the UQ framework, a comparison of the performance and reliability of HIAD and ADEPT configurations will be done. The comparison will be made for similar missions subject to uncertainties in the operating conditions, geometry, and the physical modeling parameters in flow field and thermal response simulations. Finally, in component 4, an investigation into the use of multi-fidelity modeling for the design optimization of ADEPT or HIAD technologies under uncertainty will be performed. The multi-fidelity modeling approach will allow computationally efficient and accurate design of deployable re-entry technologies under uncertainty.The proposed research will focus on reducing computational cost while maintaining a high accuracy in modeling and simulation of robust and reliable re-entry technologies with the consideration of uncertainty in the design process, and seek to demonstrate the use of multi-fidelity modeling for this purpose. The project will include strong collaboration with researchers from xxxxxx xxxxxx and ARCs. The results from the reliability analysis will be useful to xxxxxx for the decision making process during the mission design phase. It is expected that the methodologies developed under this research can also be used to benefit the development of any present or future spacecraft technology that may be considered by xxxxxx.	13926
Modified Acoustic Emission for Prognostic Health Monitoring, Phase I	2016-06-01	2018-07-19	A variety of nondestructive inspection (NDI) techniques are already available for detection of small defects within structures.  These techniques, although useful, provide little insight in terms of the remaining useful life of components or structures.  Furthermore, NDI techniques rely on statistical analyses of historical usage records and can often result in situations where maintenance schedules are occurring more often than necessary to insure safe operation.  Intelligent monitoring of the state of constituent materials allows for operation at reduced sustainment costs without sacrificing mission safety.  Prime Photonics, LC. proposes to develop a novel acoustic emission monitoring sensor as part of a larger structural health monitoring system capable of providing end-of-useful life determination.  The designed acoustic emission spectrum (AES) system will combine constituent fatigue history with local impact events tp provide a complete view of component lifetime.	13927
Flexible High-Efficiency Solar Panels for SmallSats and CubeSats, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxLink proposes to develop and test, a new type of photovoltaic module that will be suitable for use in SmallSat and CubeSat platforms requiring maximum power in a highly stowable format.  xxxxxxLink proposes to assemble and test a completed series array of five 20 cm2 cells that will output in excess of 3.5 W while demonstrating a pathway for producing significantly larger arrays capable of outputting powers in excess of 100 W.  The typical areal weight of conventional Ge-based space cells with a 5 mil thick rigid coverglass exceeds 1,000 g/m2.  xxxxxxLink's proposed flexible photovoltaic module with ultra-thin ELO solar cells and flexible coverglass material will not only be flexible and comparable in efficiency to Ge-based cells but also have an areal mass of less than 400 g/m2.  This represents greater than a 60% reduction in weight which is of particular importance for SmallSat and CubeSat applications.	13928
Nanotechnology for Advanced Imaging and Detectors	2013-10-01	2018-07-19	"The goal of this IRAD is to apply nanotechnology to create new devices to enhance both the imaging and detection of light.  We have demonstrated the capability to fabricate nanostructured metallic devices to create \"artificial molecules\" which allow interaction with electromagnetic waves in novel ways.  Our goal is to design and build a protoype metamaterial device and characterize its properties for use in imaging and detector applications.Our first objective is that of nanostructured devices for advanced light detection.  Our periodic structures exhibit absorptive (nano-antenna) and reflective (magnetic mirror) resonances across the visible to near infrared wavelength range.  Fabrication of these \"nano-antennae\" can be utilized for enhanced detection and imaging of light and the toolbox of design and fabrication tools we have developed will be applied to making proof of concept devices.  Our goal will be to build a superconducting single photon counting detector.  While superconducting nano wire single photon counting detectors have been built before, ours will be designed to do integral spectroscopy In our second objective; metamaterials for advanced imaging, we are in the process of completing an impedance matched and nanowire edged absorber devices for diffraction suppression.  We will refine our designs based on observed performance of these types of devices with the goal of performing suppressing higher orders of the Airy pattern by apodizing the edge of our test optic.  To reiterate, essentially the same periodic metallic nanowire pattern as designed and fabricated for our detector use can selectively absorb light at the edge of our device to prevent the high order \"ringing\" observed in the Airy pattern."	13929

High Temperature Energy Storage for In Situ Planetary Atmospheric Measurement Technologies, Phase II	2011-02-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxment of energy storage capable of operational temperatures of 380ºC and 486oC with a specific capacity 200 Wh/kg for use as a power source on the xxxxxxian surface and for planetary probes in similar high temperature atmospheres and where ambient pressures of 90 atmospheres are to be expected.  This proposal provides for further research and development of xxxxxx(Al)/CoS2 high temperature energy storage chemistry to develop high temperature space energy storage, which will enable the in situ exploration of the atmosphere of xxxxxx and deep atmospheres of xxxxxx or xxxxxx for future xxxxxx missions. This energy storage will provide power for thermal control systems, high temperature electronics and sensors, and high temperature motors and actuators.The approach has a parallel path of evaluation of low melting point electrolyte for 380ºC operation and optimization of the 486ºC xxxxxx energy storage chemistry. The final task is battery level characterization at various temperatures and discharge rates, with implementation of the previously completed design of a robust battery/cell container and ceramic to metal seals. The development includes the delivery of a prototype battery to JPL for testing.	13932
Live-Axis Turning for the Fabrication of Non-Rotationally Symmetric Optics, Phase I	2005-01-01	2018-07-19	The goal of this proposal is to develop a new method to create Non-Rotationally Symmetric (NRS) surfaces that overcomes the limitations of the current techniques and is fast, accurate and inexpensive.  Diamond turning (DT) has revolutionized the fabrication of lightweight optical surfaces for defense and science applications such as forward-looking infrared radar and infrared spectrometers.  It has made this impact not only because it can accurately and rapidly fabricate diffractive, refractive and reflective optical surfaces, but because it can create reference features tied to the optical surfaces to guarantee optical alignment.  An emerging trend in optical design is the use of NRS surfaces that reduce complexity, bulk and weight.  To create these surfaces, DT machines have been modified with a low-amplitude Fast Tool Servo, a third axis or a fly-cutter.  The problem with the FTS is its limited range and the other techniques are plagued by thermal drift during long fabrication times.  The proposed Live Axis Turning (LAT) process combines evolving technologies of air bearings, linear motors, high-resolution encoders and high-speed control systems into a moving lightweight toolpost on a conventional DT machine.  The result is a more flexible machine that can increase production and reduce cost for NRS components.	13933

Compact Low-Power Driver for Deformable Mirror Systems, Phase II	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	This proposal describes a new concept to drive MEMS DMs using low-power, high-voltage multiplexing. Compared to other reported approaches, the proposed architecture will reduce power consumption by a factor of one hundred, to a level of a few hundred milliwatts. This estimate is supported by direct measurements obtained from prototype modules that were demonstrated in xxxxxx I research.In the xxxxxx project we will scale up this innovative circuit DMs that xxxxxx xxxxxxchines Corporation (BMC) developed for xxxxxx in support of the Terrestrial xxxxxxet Finding program. At the same time, we will reduce the driver's size in two successive stages of integration. In the first stage, we will implement a hybrid packaging approach in which a 993-actuator DM, HV amplifier, multiplexer components, and power supplies will all be co-located on a common multi-layered circuit board. With this driver we will demonstrate both low power consumption (xxxxxx) and high precision (~10pm). In the second stage of integration, we will design, fabricate, and test a High xxxxxxtage xxxxxxlication-Specific xxxxxxted Circuit (HV-ASIC) version of the multiplexing architecture using a commercial foundry. We will combine a number of these 256 channel HV-ASIC modules into a driver for a 3063 actuator DM that is currently being developed by BMC to support xxxxxx coronography goals.	13936
VG2 NEP PLS DERIVED RDR ELECTRON MAGNETOSPHERE 96SEC V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	The electron spectra are fit using several isotropic xxxxxxian distribution functions to find electron parameters. The spacecraft charge may seriously affect the density measurements. The temperature of each component is, however, independent of the spacecraft potential. To obtain the best estimate of the electron density, the encounter period is divided into four regions and four different analysis methods are used.	13937
Pluto Hop, Skip, and Jump	2018-01-01	2018-07-19	Imagine a craft that could enter xxxxxx atmosphere at 14 km/s and deliver a 200 kg lander to the surface using aerodynamic drag and just a few kg of propellant. xxxxxx surface pressure is just 10 millionths of xxxxxx, but its atmosphere is about 7 times higher than xxxxxx and its volume is about 350 times the volume of xxxxxx itself. Over a several hundred kilometer entry distance, this ultra-low ballistic coefficient craft can dissipate over 99.999% of its initial kinetic energy, resulting in a terminal velocity comparable to or less than past planetary landers or rovers. With this architecture, the total propellant requirement for landing on xxxxxx is less than 3.5 kg! After making science measurements at its initial landing site, the lander switches to “hopper” mode, taking advantage of the low gravitational acceleration (0.063 gee) and a modest propellant store to literally hop, skip, and jump around the surface, sometimes kilometers at a time, investigating features of interest. The proposed concept would enable in-situ surface science at xxxxxx with low overall mass, a reasonable cost, and in a timeframe of about 10-15 years.	13938
Integrated Advanced Monopropellant CMC Thruster / Thermal Stand-Off Assembly, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	High performance non-toxic monopropellants offer significant benefits relative to the current state-of-the-art. The benefits of these advanced monopropellants (AMP) include improved safety, a 50% reduction in density, and a 20% improvement in specific impulse (ISP). AMP propulsion represents a significant challenge for thruster components and assemblies due to the higher temperatures and the chemical constituents of the exhaust.  This proposed program, with the support of xxxxxx Redmond, will develop, design and fabricate an integrated ceramic matrix composite (CMC) thruster assembly comprised of the thermal stand-off (TSO), combustion chamber, and nozzle. The TSO will mitigate heat soak-back to the propellant valve utilizing an insulating CMC operating with a combustion environment greater than 2000oC. A phased design plan will be used for developing the integrated thruster assembly and results confirmed by test firing under representative conditions. A TSO prototype will be fabricated and the thermomechanical and thermochemical properties tested and analyzed during the xxxxxx I program. xxxxxx will utilize the TSO, materials development and conceptual design from the xxxxxx I to develop an integrated CMC TSO - combustion chamber and nozzle assembly.  A successful program will provide technology benefits resulting from improved performance, reduced cost and improved manufacturability.	13939
Semantic Language and Tools for Reporting Human Factors Incidents, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxidents related to impaired human performance in space operations can be caused by environmental conditions, situational challenges, and operational deficiencies.  xxxxxxing, reporting, and correlating related incidents are key to preventing future incidents.  xxxxxx has made significant progress in standardizing the reporting of aviation incidents by developing electronic forms for reporting incidents.   While such forms improve report consistency, incident data are not represented in a way that enables computer-based reasoning across reports (e.g., automatic linking of related reports.)  xxxxxx proposes to develop a human factors incident-reporting tool for gathering incident data, documenting data in incident reports, and archiving incident data. We will define an XML-based semantic language for incident reporting to capture information about human factors incidents, including multi-modal data. We will develop software for authoring incident reports using this language, archiving these reports, and searching the archives using incident semantics. This project is innovative in defining an incident reporting language that uses an ontology-based vocabulary.  This enables improved tools for gathering incident data, and for authoring and archiving incident reports. The semantic indexing provided by the use of incident reporting language permits more sophisticated search of archives, including automatic identification of prior incidents potentially relevant to the current incident.	13940

Only linear polarizations are reported. Both standard and non-standard broadband and narrowband filters were employed. A total of 752 observations are included spanning the period 13 xxxxxxember 1985 to 17 May 1986.	13941
Optical System for Atmospheric Particle Measurement, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	To measure the broad size range of 0.1 micron to 200 micron, we propose an optical instrument that combines two techniques: Forward scattering light intensity (FSLI) and digital holography (DH). FSLI will provide the size and concentration of particles in the 0.1 to 5 micron range while DH will provide the size, concentration and shape of particles larger than 5 micron. xxxxxx measurements with FSLI rely on precisely knowing the intensity of the illumination beam at the position of the particle. An innovative fiber optic bundle will select for measurement the particles that cross the very center of the illumination beam where the intensity is uniform and known. The proposed DH strategy will employ small CCD with fast data transfer to enable continued scanning of the atmosphere over many meters or even hundreds of meters. Both technologies will employ small, low power components making them suitable for UAV operation. The xxxxxx I work will include modeling and experimental demonstrations culminating with the conceptual design of a field prototype system.	13942

Luminescent Sensors for Ocean Water Monitoring, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx-based global measurements of atmospheric xxxxxx must be complemented with ocean water analysis. xxxxxx ocean acidification, which results from the accumulation of xxxxxx, is of critical interest, since progressive acidification is already affecting oceans and coastal estuaries and waterways. To that end, xxxxxx and NOAA are seeking in-situ monitoring devices for oceanic and coastal water monitoring, including a pH sensor for seawater, to support space-based monitoring programs. xxxxxx ocean pH accurately over large areas has proved to be extremely difficult, and classic sensor technology, based on potentiometric measurements (pH electrodes), have shown significant limitations: current instruments are expensive, do not monitor pH directly, and therefore need complex signal compensation to yield accurate measurements, and require frequent calibration. Intelligent xxxxxxical xxxxxxs proposes to develop a novel luminescent sensor for pH, taking advantage of novel materials developed to monitor pH and other parameters of interest in high salinity and elevated pressure environments; it will exhibit high selectivity (direct pH measurements) and stability. A novel antifouling technology with no mechanical parts will prevent sensor degradation in seawater. To contain the cost of the electronics while maintaining high performance in detecting the luminescent signal, we will use Circuit Seed circuits, which process analog signals on 100% digital components. This enables them to reduce size and parts count, simplifying quality control and power requirements, and will enable us to produce high-performance, low-cost optoelectronic units.	13945

System Engineering Software Assessment Model for Exploration (SESAME), Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	Concept phase space-systems architecture evaluations typically use mass estimates as the primary means of ranking potential mission architectures. Software does not directly have physical mass and, as a result, is often left-out of such evaluations, despite the potential of being one of the main contributors to a mission's overall cost and risk. During xxxxxx Concept Exploration and Refinement (CE&R) program, personnel from MIT, xxxxxxoratories, and xxxxxx xxxxxxs xxxxxx. developed a systems architecture software assessment approach that addresses both the early concept phases of a program and the complexities of critical embedded software systems. This approach uses a series of weighted software and human-computer interaction parameters that evaluate how a system's architecture affects software. xxxxxx xxxxxxs xxxxxx. proposes to validate this xxxxxxs xxxxxxing Software Assessment xxxxxx for Exploration as the next step on the path to a tool that provides early, reliable ranking of systems architectures based on software. The xxxxxx I effort will focus on validation of this assessment tool. This validation will be based on embedded spaceflight systems projects. Once validated, this assessment approach will provide a basis, during xxxxxx, for the development of a xxxxxxs xxxxxxing tool for assessing the impact candidate system architectures on software.	13947
Communication System and Avionics for Deployable Small Free Flying Payloads	2017-09-01	2018-07-19	This IRAD will develop a core part of the communication system for the small free flying payloads. &nbsp;In particular, this portion of the system will consist of the circuitry for modulation, data transmission, and power amplification for the deployable sub payload. &nbsp;The development is a key part in the complete communication system which will include the main payload receiving system that will process the data transmissions for up to 48 instrumented sub payloads. &nbsp;The communication system will be used on suborbital platforms where telemetry on deployable free flying payloads is required. &nbsp;Current capabilities for this number of telemetered deployable bodies do not exist at this time, so this development will enable deployable sub payloads to collect scientific data in constellation configurations where otherwise impossible.The objective of the project is to a have a functional communication system (data and transmission) for a single deployable sub payload.&nbsp;The innovative features of this project:xxxxxxment of a core part (sub payload compact transmission system) of direct link communications between multiple payload bodies (currently, capability is not available).Currently, the small size of the deployables prevents the use of off the shelf components to be utilized and necessitates the need for a compact design to meet the specific form factor (Length = 5in, 3.4in Diameter).&nbsp;At the completion of the IRAD, if awarded, the intent is to produce a printed circuit board (PCB) that will be used for the encoding (for this IRAD, a fixed data pattern will be used) and signal conditioning of the data as well as for the circuitry for the power amplifier (PA) and data handling unit.	13948
An Integrated Framework for Model-Based Distributed Diagnosis and Prognosis	2013-07-29	2018-07-19	xxxxxx and prognosis are necessary tasks for system re- configuration and fault-adaptive control in complex systems. xxxxxx consists of detection, isolation and identification of faults, while prognosis consists of prediction of the remain- ing useful life of systems. This paper presents a novel inte- grated framework for model-based distributed diagnosis and prognosis, where system decomposition is used to enable the diagnosis and prognosis tasks to be performed in a distributed way. We show how different submodels can be automati- cally constructed to solve the local diagnosis and prognosis problems. We illustrate our approach using a simulated four- wheeled rover for different fault scenarios. Our experiments show that our approach correctly performs distributed fault diagnosis and prognosis in an efficient and robust manner.	13949
Advanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysts for PEM Electrolyzers, Phase II	2013-05-01	2018-07-19	Future xxxxxx missions require high efficiency, lightweight, long life, and maintenance-free water electrolyzer technologies to generate oxygen and/or hydrogen for energy storage, propulsion, life-support systems, cabin-oxygen replenishment, and zero-g science activities.  xxxxxx, future xxxxxx and xxxxxx Outposts, and future exploration vehicles require high efficiency electrolyzers to improve their operational capabilities for long and complex missions.  The oxygen evolution reaction is the limiting step due to non-optimal electrocatalyst structure.  State-of-the-art electrocatalysts do not meet MEA efficiency and lifetime requirements for xxxxxx applications.  xxxxxxanced electrocatalysts are needed.  In the xxxxxx I, Lynntech manufactured a binary nanoparticle surface decorated mixed oxide electrocatalyst with the optimal microstructure and demonstrated an MEA efficiency of >90% (i.e., an electrolysis potential of 1.358 V/cell) at 200 mA/cm2.  In the xxxxxx program, Lynntech will investigate different catalyst morphologies to improve the lifetime.  In addition, ternary transition metal oxides will be incorporated into the mixed oxide to further increase the efficiency and lifetime.  The applicability of this advanced catalyst to different membranes will be investigated.  xxxxxxcomposite membranes with low hydrogen gas cross-over will be manufactured and tested.  A short electrolyzer stack will be assembled with the optimized components, tested and delivered to xxxxxx.	13950
Plasma Treatment to Enhance Fuel Cell Water Management	2013-10-01	2018-07-19	This proposal builds on preliminary work, performed in 2012, which demonstrated that plasma treatment methods can effectively modify the wetting characteristics of various porous metal structures. Such structures are critical to the two-phase fluid separation processes used in non-flow-through fuel cells and static feed electrolyzers. xxxxxximization of these structures is the key to achieving dramatic reductions in the complexity and mass of regenerative fuel cells (RFCs).  The objective of this proposal is to further define the potential for plasma treatment technology, developed by the xxxxxx xxxxxx (GRC) to modify and enhance the wetting characteristics of water management surfaces. If successful, such enhancements will lead to more robust operation and reduced system complexity. xxxxxx which promote both hydrophilic and hydrophobic character will be explored.	13951
Integrated Reacting Fluid Dynamics and Predictive Materials Degradation Models for Propulsion System Conditions, Phase I	2016-06-01	2018-07-19	Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are routinely used by xxxxxx to optimize the design of propulsion systems. Current methods for CFD modeling rely on general materials properties to determine fluid structure interactions. This introduces uncertainty when modeling extreme conditions, where materials degrade and properties may change as a consequence. This also limits the use of CFD as a modeling tool to assist in material selection and specification. CFDRC in partnership with xxxxxx xxxxxxoratories proposes to develop a computational materials model to simulate degradation of a ceramic matrix composite material under the high temperature, high velocity flow conditions of the propulsion environment.  The objective is to provide a computational tool to assist xxxxxx in the selection and optimization of propulsion system materials and to predict material degradation and failure throughout the service life in extreme conditions. During xxxxxx I the team will demonstrate a mesoscale materials model based on peridynamics, a theory of continuum mechanics that can describe fracture and defect progression at the level of the microstructure. Peridynamics provides a theoretical framework to dynamically simulate fracture and mechanical erosion at the mesoscale, where properties such as tensile strength and toughness are affected by features of the microstructure and composite design.  The proposed modeling scheme use CFD to establish the thermal-mechanical stresses imposed at the boundaries of the structure.  Peridynamics simulations will be used to determine the evolution of the macroscale properties as a function of microstructure, damage and boundary conditions. xxxxxx to link time and condition dependent materials properties with the CFD system will be evaluated.	13952

Miniaturized Magnetometers	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	We will develop miniaturized magnetometers for use on very resource-constrained missions. Specifically we will develop two types of magnetometers that will require significantly less resources than our current fluxgate magnetometers (e.g. xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and xxxxxx Plus).	13954
High Performance Spatial Filter Array Based on Single Mode Fiber Bundle, Phase II	2015-04-01	2018-07-19	In xxxxxx I project, by leveraging on Agiltron's experience in optical fiber components and our unique fabrication procedure of fiber array, we successfully designed and fabricated the samples of the gradient index fiber (GIF) lens arrays and single mode (SM) fiber arrays for composing a coherent single-mode fiber (SMF) spatial filter array (SFA), which demonstrated the promising results to meet xxxxxx requirements for the applications in planet exploration. This novel GIF and SMF array based SFA has several advantages over the current approach in small aberration, low insertion loss, high uniformity, high robust and stability.  In xxxxxx, Agiltron will further improve and optimize the fabrication procedure to make the prototype of GIF and SMF array based SFA for xxxxxx applications. This SFA prototype will have more than 1000 effective fiber counts in the requested aperture. Furthermore, the improvements of precision fabrication procedure developed in xxxxxx I will assure that center-to-center deviation in GIF and SMF arrays' deviation is less than +/-0.2µm. At the end of the xxxxxx, the novel SFA prototype will be provided with fully function integration and environmental test to insert into the experiment system of xxxxxx for further comprehensive evaluation.	13955
Merging Geospatial Data into a User-Friendly Application to Support Sustainable Development	2013-04-01	2018-07-19	For this project, an economic development tool called the Local Economic xxxxxx Portfolio (LEAP) tool was produced. LEAP is a xxxxxx Information xxxxxx (GIS) system which allows users to create earth-based mapping systems that describe the environmental conditions, physical infrastructure and related features for use in land/base management decisions. &nbsp;The primary function of this tool is to generate portfolios coupling standard descriptors about potential sites with maps and location specific information. xxxxxxs can select criteria in a wizard-based tool to perform site selection analysis or draw primary and alternate sites to obtain site specific information related to the area of interest. The intention of the tool is to provide a user-friendly interface for personnel responsible for working on economic development at xxxxxx (SSC) and the surrounding community.&nbsp;&nbsp; An economic development tool, for use at SSC, was developed to generate portfolios coupling standard descriptors about potential sites with maps and location specific information. The generated portfolios include pre-created maps, dynamic map products, acreages, demographic reporting of the surrounding area, areas within a specified transportation distance, distance to utilities and other critical infrastructure, soil/regolith types, and proximity to dangerous condition areas, that could potentially be used for infrastructure layout and development for decision making. The wizard-based tool allows personnel working with potential tenants to step through these descriptive areas to edit or verify the populated information before generating the portfolio.&nbsp; The first step involves using query tools to find property or space within a specified size constraint. Once the user has selected all the desired site information, and entered and/or verified the categorized information, the final portfolio document can be created.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;	13956

We actively manage the archive to maximize its usefulness, and it has become a basic resource for scientists around the world.	13957
High Temperature Venus Drill and Sample Delivery System, Phase II	2017-06-01	2018-07-19	Under xxxxxx, we investigated HT xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and Pneumatic Sample xxxxxxy. We found that xxxxxx and xxxxxx-based pneumatic system won't be feasible or carried high risk associated with development of HT cutter materials. Rotary drill also did not penetrate hard rocks. For xxxxxx 2, we propose xxxxxx drill and 'suction' based pneumatic sample delivery. xxxxxx is also submitting a separate xxxxxx 2 for 3 DOF HT arm. If that proposal gets selected, the arm will deploy the drill and deposit the sample. The pneumatic system would still be needed to move the sample into an instrument. We plan to design and build xxxxxx 5 system and incorporate HT motors developed by xxxxxx under prior xxxxxx projects. The demonstration will be done in a HT chamber. We will investigate possibility of testing at xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx chamber. The demo will include drilling into hard rocks and sample transfer to a mock up instrument.	13958
Friction Stir Processing of Cast Superalloys, Phase II	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	"This xxxxxx effort examines the feasibility of an innovative fabrication technology incorporating sand casting and friction stir processing (FSP) for producing affordable near net shape components made from high performance Ni-based superalloys.  Sand casting is a relatively inexpensive casting method not traditionally used to manufacture superalloy castings.  Instead of expensive \"invested\" ceramic shells found in investment casting, the molds are produced from a mixture of inexpensive fine sand and/or graphite powder.  Friction stir processing is an emerging microstructural modification technique based on friction stir welding (FSW).  It can be applied to enhance the microstructure-properties of the cast material thus improve the damage tolerance capabilities.  This step is needed to allow cast superalloy rocket propulsion components to be used without casting factors.  If this unique technology can be successfully developed and applied, it will have the tremendous potential for reducing the weight and cost of Ni-based superalloy castings that are used in industries as diverse as rocket propulsion, aircraft engines, land-based gas turbines, and chemical process industry pumps and valves."	13959
Stability Analysis of Spacecraft Motion in the Vicinity of Asteroids	2017-09-01	2018-07-19	The objective of my proposal is to determine the stability of a spacecraft when in the vicinity of an asteroid. Orbiting an asteroid is a difficult task. The unique shapes in which asteroids are formed cause the gravity around them to be non-uniform. This causes perturbations in the movement of a spacecraft around an asteroid. xxxxxxar radiation pressure can also alter the orbit of a spacecraft around an asteroid. With multiple perturbations on a spacecraft, orbiting an asteroid can become unstable over time. This instability could lead to the spacecraft escaping from the body or crashing into the asteroid. By determining an algorithm that can define the stability of a spacecraft around an asteroid, safe and stable orbits can be found for an operational spacecraft. In order to achieve a greater understanding of the stability of a spacecraft in the vicinity of an asteroid, the dynamics of the spacecraft around the asteroid must be well understood. All perturbing forces that will act on a spacecraft orbiting an asteroid must be accurately modeled. This includes mathematical modeling of the gravity around the asteroid due to its non-spherical shape, third-body dynamics from the sun, and solar radiation pressure. Rotation of the spacecraft and asteroid will also be part of accurately modeling the dynamics of this system. The largest portion of the research will be focused on determining what the proper definition of stability is for the spacecraft. Stability of a system can be defined in various ways using multiple stability analysis methods. Because these differing methods often result in subtle differences that have significant consequences, the determination of stability for a spacecraft mission can be difficult to find using mathematical definitions that apply to practical needs of the mission. Therefore finding a meaningful mathematical definition for stability that can be applied to an operation mission will be the core of my research. xxxxxx stability will used as a preliminary tool to give insight into more complex methods of determining stability. This includes the stability methods such as xxxxxx characteristic exponents, FLI, and MEGNO. For future missions to asteroids this allows the spacecraft to orbit naturally without as many correctional maneuvers. Also, understanding the stability of a spacecraft around an asteroid will give future missions more confidence in opting to orbit in close proximity of the asteroid, which will allow for more science to be obtained. Gaining knowledge on the behavior of a spacecraft around an asteroid will help define go to stable orbits that are dependable for the spacecraft to stay in for long periods of time. By better understanding the dynamics and stability of spacecraft motion around an asteroid, a spacecraft will be able to achieve better understanding of the asteroids size, shape, rotation, gravity field, and mass. Therefore it encourages a relationship where a better understanding of the dynamics of the spacecraft causes more science to be found; and with better science comes more refined models that improve the dynamics of the orbiting spacecraft. This information can be used for both scientific human missions and resource extraction missions to asteroids. xxxxxx plans on landing humans on an asteroid with the next generation of crewed space flight vehicles. With human life on the line, knowledge of how the crew transport vehicle will behave orbiting the asteroid needs to be well known.	13960
Laser-Directed CVD 3D Printing of Refractory Metal Rocket Propulsion Hardware, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	In this project, xxxxxx will develop a three-dimensional (3D) laser-directed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) additive manufacturing system to build free-form refractory metal structures for liquid rocket propulsion systems. By combining xxxxxx's decades of experience in refractory metal deposition by CVD with the computer control of directed laser energy, nearly unlimited expression of part shape and metal alloy composition can be realized for next-generation rocket propulsion component fabrication. 3D additive manufacturing is currently revolutionizing many industries by offering unconstrained complex build geometries, reduced cost, reduced lead time, and reduced material usage compared with conventional manufacturing techniques. By developing laser CVD technology for refractory metals, xxxxxx will bring these inherent benefits to a class of materials that are notoriously difficult to form and thus are expensive to implement. By depositing successive layers of metal directly from reactive parent gases, the system will be able to build components from rhenium, tantalum, niobium, tungsten, and their alloys with complex internal features and assembly part count reductions. In this project, xxxxxx will design and build the required laser-directed CVD reactor, achieve layered deposition, and map the process conditions for the formation of rhenium metal structures.	13961
Fiber Laser Coherent Lidar for Wake-Vortex Hazard Detection, Phase II	2013-01-01	2018-07-19	We propose a 1.5um fiber-optic pulsed coherent lidar as a highly effective sensor sub-system for airborne wake-vortex hazard detection. The proposed design is based on a recently developed platform at xxxxxx, for fiber-optic pulsed coherent lidar capable of 6km range, and operating at high pulse rate to give high-resolution spatial map and circulation strength, characteristic of typical wake-vortex signatures. The proposed system uses all COTS 1.5um fiber-optic component technology and COTS high-speed digital electronics, to provide a cost-effective system, that is amenable to rapid transition for field testing and adoption.	13962

Elemental Resource Breakdown Approach to Crew-Vehicle Design, Phase I	2018-06-01	2018-07-19	TSRCo and CU are developing a framework to quantify and predict crew performance in various spacecraft designs in the context of the design process. The framework utilizes an elemental resource breakdown approach to relate the crew, the spacecraft design, and operations.  The elements identified in the breakdown correspond to existing measures currently used in the physiological, cognitive, and psychological fields. This novel integration of currently existing metrics allows for the quantification of specific crew resource elements over the mission timeline and an in-depth analysis of the impacts caused by various spacecraft design choices.	13965
Probabilistic Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Composite Aircraft Components, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	A composite fatigue damage assessment and risk informed prognosis toolkit will be developed by enhancing and integrating existing solution modules within a probabilistic analysis framework. This tool will for the first time be able to address concurrently both microcracking induced stiffness degradation and cyclic loading induced delamination crack growth without remeshing. A physics-based deterministic solver will be developed by integrating a discrete crack network model with a multiaxial fatigue damage accumulation law. An advanced probabilistic analysis framework with the xxxxxxian xxxxxximum Entropy (BME) updating procedure will be developed for risk informed total life management. The damage detection results will be integrated/fused with the physics based delamination growth prediction tool to form a risk informed damage prognosis and condition based maintenance metrics. xxxxxx xxxxxxing and Materials, xxxxxx. (GEM) has secured commitments for technical support from Clarkson xxxxxxersity and Boeing, who will provide existing solution modules, supporting data, customization plug-ins, and expertise. The multi-faceted feasibility study consists of developing a method that will enable the prediction of multi-site, multi-mode damage interaction, extracting delamination driving force, characterizing delamination evolution under multiaxial non-proportional loading, and performing risk informed fatigue failure prediction and BME updating when new detection and maintenance data become available.	13966
Integrated Multi-Physics and Advanced Diagnostics for NTR Development, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx, designing a nuclear thermal rocket engine and determining fuel performance has been a refractory and anfractuous process.  Typically, fuel forms would be developed and tested in separate tests of mechanical, radiation and thermal testing, and, in the NERVA program, the fuel elements were assembled in a rocket engine and tested.  The fuel did not perform to expectations, and the engine needed to be disassembled, the fuel examined and fixed needed to be determined; then the process would repeat itself.In xxxxxx, individual fuel elements were tested, but they could not be tested to full power density due to test reactor limitations.  Nevertheless, this was a far less expensive approach that full engine testing to determine whether the fuel elements in particular would withstand the rigors of the NRE (Nuclear xxxxxx Engine) mission. This proposal outline how LPS and its team members plan to integrate the latest in multi-physics model to simulate a fuel element based on a particular NRE design built up from designer parameters.  The multi-physics modules can determine fuel integrity and fission product retention as a function of temperature and operating times, determine micro-structure evolution including cracking and grain growth.  The fuel element parameters are derived from high level NRE requirements via the integration of the Ixxxxxx (xxxxxxted xxxxxx xxxxxximization Code), linked with PHOENIX, a program linking multi-physics modules through MOOSE (xxxxxx-physics Object-xxxxxxd Simulation Environment)  Ultimately, detailed safety related information including results of impact analyses through extensive hydro-codes such as PRONTO/SPH and radiation transport codes such as MACCS2.  This enables safety to be integrated in from the very beginning of the design process resulting in a much more optimized safety based nuclear rocket engine.	13967
Fault Tree Generation and Augmentation, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx (FM) is one of the key components of system autonomy.  In order to guarantee FM effectiveness and control the cost, tools are required to automate fault-tree generation and updates based on design models specified in standardized design languages such as AADL.  Accordingly, we propose a fault tree generation and augmentation environment (FTGA).  Equipped by a fault class model and an FM method catalog, FTGA evaluates not only failure behavior in the application under analysis but also FM's capability and adequacy for failure mitigation.  Moreover, when an inadequacy in FM is revealed during fault tree generation or analysis, the fault tree will be allowed for augmentation through FM method insertion and be followed by a quantitative evaluation for FM effectiveness validation.  Therefore, unlike traditional fault tree analysis which plays a passive role in FM, the automated FTGA environment actively and explicitly influence system design and updates, enabling \"fault-tree-in-the-loop\" for a system's life cycle.  Further, by separating its generic functions (which we collectively call \"shared package\") from design-language-specific functions (which we collectively call \"interface package\"), FTGA will be an extensible modeling environment.  The anticipated results from the xxxxxx I project will be a preliminary prototype of FTGA and a demonstration for concept validation."	13968
Spaceflight 1.94 Micron Tm Fiber Laser Transmitter, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx will develop a spaceflight prototype 1940 nm, 100 W thulium (Tm) laser suitable for xxxxxx spaceflight and long-duration unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) missions. The proposal is innovative because it demonstrates 100 W of polarization maintaining (PM) performance at 1940 nm. We expect a 2x to 3x improvement in efficiency compared to available commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) unpolarized Tm fiber lasers, and the laser will be packaged for high reliability for spaceflight operation. This xxxxxx leverages commercial Tm laser technology, published scientific test data, available optical components, and xxxxxx's validated Tm fiber laser model. A spaceflight 100 W PM Tm laser is enabling and provides a path to space for a pulsed, Q-switched 2 um Ho:xxxxxx laser with up to 80 mJ/pulse at 100-200 Hz. xxxxxx performance design studies from a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite indicate that 80 mJ of pulsed 2 um energy enables the simultaneous measurements of xxxxxx and water vapor using xxxxxxted xxxxxx Differential Absorption (IPDA) and global wind light detection and ranging (lidar). xxxxxx laser experiments have shown the 100 W of 1940 nm peak pump power is needed to generate 80 mJ/pulse.	13969
Highly Efficient Solid Oxide Electrolyzer & Sabatier System, Phase II	2017-01-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxment Corporation (xxxxxx) and ENrG xxxxxxorporated (ENrG) are teaming to provide a highly efficient reactor for carbon monoxide/carbon dioxide (CO/xxxxxx) conversion into methane (xxxxxx). The system is a gravity-independent, compact, leak-tight, xxxxxx xxxxxx (SOE) system with embedded xxxxxx reactors (ESR). xxxxxxlying Corning xxxxxxorporated (Corning) Intellectual Property (IP), ENrG and xxxxxx can leverage an all-ceramic, efficient, and low mass solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) that remains leak-tight after hundreds of thermal cycles. xxxxxx proposes that incorporation of the all-ceramic technology into our SOE/ESR system will result in a design that will: 1) be thermally shock tolerant and capable of hundreds of on-off cycles at faster cycles than compared to the metal-to-ceramic SOE designs, 2) be lighter, smaller, and require less power than existing designs, 3) allow for high (>90%) single pass utilization of feedstock, and 4) achieve a thermodynamic efficiency of up to 80%. Our xxxxxx effort includes laboratory tests to optimize operation of an all-ceramic design for increased single pass utilization of the feed stock and mitigation of carbon deposition. xxxxxxing analyses and component testing will be performed to inform the design of a stack. The stack will be built and tested to verify requirements. xxxxxxults will be used to size a full system with recommendations for integration.  An engineering development unit will be built and delivered to xxxxxx. xxxxxxting cells that operate as either an electrolyzer or a xxxxxx reactor simplifies operations, lowers hardware complexity, and increases reliability. The proposed system can perform multiple functions without modifications, making it a readily deployable technology for various missions from ISRU on the xxxxxx and xxxxxx to regenerating 100% of a crew's oxygen in spacecraft or habitats.	13970
Self-Regulating Freezable Heat Exchanger and Radiator, Phase I	2008-01-01	2018-07-19	At present, both the astronaut's metabolic heat and that produced by the Portable Life Support xxxxxx are rejected to space by a sublimator that consumes up to 8 pounds of water per use; the single largest expendable during an eight-hour EVA.  Unfortunately, this will not be acceptable for lunar and interplanetary missions where resupply is difficult.  We can greatly reduce the water consumption by radiating most of the heat load to space.  xxxxxxver, a radiator rejects heat at a relatively constant rate, whereas the heat generation rate depends on the workload.  Without a way to match the heat removal rate, the astronaut could alternately suffer both heat exhaustion and frostbite.  Therefore, TDA xxxxxxearch, xxxxxx. proposes to regulate the heat rejection rate with a freezable heat exchanger.  In xxxxxx I we will conduct tests to show that the heat transfer rate can be self-regulated from high to low heat loads and vice-versa.  Our research institute partner, xxxxxx State xxxxxxersity, will design zero-g loop heat pipes to transfer heat from the heat exchanger to the radiator.  In xxxxxx we will design and build a full-scale freezable heat exchanger and lightweight radiator and evaluate its performance in an environmental vacuum chamber.	13971
High Efficiency Quantum Dot III-V Multijunction Solar Cell for Space Power, Phase II	2007-04-01	2018-07-19	We are proposing to utilize quantum dots to develop a super high-efficiency multijunction xxxxxx-V solar cell for space.  In metamorphic triple junction space solar cells, pioneered by Essential xxxxxxearch, xxxxxx., the Inxxxxxx junction or bottom cell of the three-cell stack is the current limiting entity.  In xxxxxx I of this program, we demonstrated that InAs quantum dots can be formed by MOVPE, and then incorporated in an Inxxxxxx cell to provide sub-gap absorption and thus improve its short-circuit current.  For the xxxxxx work, we propose to optimize this quantum dot Inxxxxxx cell, and develop a three-cell stack to achieve a space solar cell whose efficiency would dramatically exceed current SOA standards.  A theoretical estimate predicts that a InGaAlP(1.95 eV)/xxxxxx(1.35 eV)/Inxxxxxx(1.2 eV) triple junction cell incorporating quantum dots to improve the bottom cell current would have an efficiency exceeding 40%.Quantum dots will allow xxxxxx not only to improve device efficiency by expanding the spectral response of individual cells, but to improve the temperature coefficients and radiation tolerance as well.  This is extremely important as xxxxxx attempts to increase array specific power with new concentrator designs and continues to expand the range of environments to be encountered in future missions.	13972

A Generalized Software Toolkit for Portable GPU-Enabled Chemistry Acceleration in CFD Applications, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Current combustor design simulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving fuel-lean combustion have entailed using large amounts of dedicated CPU resources for extended time periods due to the expense of solving detailed, strongly-coupled, chemical kinetic models.  Such models are inherently data parallel, and much faster solutions can be obtained using low-cost graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware without loss of accuracy.  This proposal describes development of a user-friendly software toolkit that facilitates implementing detailed or reduced fuel chemistry solvers directly onto xxxxxx to substantially accelerate CFD simulation runtimes.  The approach is significant because it provides a cost-effective path to substantially reduce the wall-clock times currently bottlenecking high-fidelity combustion simulations.  It accommodates the incorporation of self-contained, real fuel kinetic mechanisms and validated chemistry solvers, written using standard GPU-recognized program language extensions such as CUDA and xxxxxx, for use in CFD analyses with minimal end-user code modifications.  Using inputs that are xxxxxx-format compatible, the proposed software toolkit will generate portable, GPU-enabled kernels that can be directly compiled into existing CFD codes, such as the xxxxxxional Combustion Code (NCC), to accelerate detailed combustion simulations for improved design support.	13976
Propulsion Health Monitoring of a Turbine Engine Disk using Spin Test Data	2011-02-18	2018-07-19	On line detection techniques to monitor the health of rotating engine components are becoming increasingly attractive options to aircraft engine companies in order to increase safety of operation and lower maintenance costs. Health monitoring remains a challenging feature to easily implement, especially, in the presence of scattered loading conditions, crack size, component geometry and materials properties. The current trend, however, is to utilize noninvasive types of health monitoring or nondestructive techniques to detect hidden flaws and mini cracks before any catastrophic event occurs. These techniques go further to evaluate materials' discontinuities and other anomalies that have grown to the level of critical defects which can lead to failure. xxxxxxrally, health monitoring is highly dependent on sensor systems that are capable of performing in various engine environmental conditions and able to transmit a signal upon a predetermined crack length, while acting in a neutral form upon the overall performance of the engine system. Efforts are under way at xxxxxx xxxxxx through support of the Intelligent Vehicle Health Management Project (IVHM) to develop and implement such sensor technology for a wide variety of applications [1-5]. These efforts are focused on developing high temperature, wireless, low cost and durable products.Therefore, in an effort to address the technical issues concerning health monitoring of a rotor disk, this paper considers data collected from an experimental study using high frequency capacitive sensor technology to capture blade tip clearance and tip timing measurements in a rotating engine-like-disk-to predict the disk faults and assess its structural integrity. The experimental results collected at a range of rotational speeds from tests conducted at the xxxxxx xxxxxx's Rotordynamics xxxxxx will be evaluated using multiple data-driven anomaly detection techniques [6-9] to identify anomalies in the disk. This study is expected to present a select evaluation of online health monitoring of a rotating disk using these high caliber sensors and test the capability of the in-house spin system.	13977
V-Band Wireless Surface Networks, Phase I	2008-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx GLENN RExxxxxxCH CENTER in Topic O1.10 has identified the need to provide surface communications networks for human and robotic missions to explore the xxxxxx and xxxxxx.  The network nodes will be located at fixed sites, as well as on robotic vehicles and on humans that are moving about on the surface.  The purpose is for relatively short range, but highly reliable, support of bi-directional voice, video and data services.  Such nodes will be attached to sensors, other devices, xxxxxx robots, access network terminals and humans. The requirement for low cost means that the hardware should leverage available and emerging commercial off-the-shelf technology (COTS) to the extent possible.  The work completed under topic O1.10 is intended to be compatible and integrated with results from other topics.

Software Tools for Fault Management Technologies, Phase II	2015-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx (FM) is a key requirement for safety, efficient onboard and ground operations, maintenance, and repair. QSI's xxxxxx suite is a leading facilitator diagnostic and FM modeling, and performing various FM-related functions. Through this effort, QSI proposes to introduce capabilities to TEAMS that would significantly xxxxxx diagnostic model development cost and time, Enhance analytic capabilities for aiding model evaluation, and,  Improve FMECA xxxxxxess. These issues are of critical importance in developing and maintaining diagnostic models in a cost and time efficient manner and utilizing those for analyses related to diagnostic designs, models and overall scheme evaluation.

Torpor Inducing Transfer Habitat For Human Stasis To Mars	2014-03-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxxxxxxx proposes the design of a torpor-inducing xxxxxx transfer habitat and an architectural-level assessment to fully characterize the impact to xxxxxx exploration.The idea of suspended animation for interstellar human spaceflight has often been posited as a promising far-term solution for long-duration spaceflight. A means for full cryo-preservation and restoration remains a long way off still. xxxxxxver, recent medical progress is quickly advancing our ability to induce deep sleep states (i.e. torpor) with significantly reduced metabolic rates for humans over extended periods of time. xxxxxx should leverage these advancements for spaceflight as they can potentially eliminate a number of very challenging technical hurdles, reduce the IMLEO for the system, and ultimately enable feasible and sustainable missions to xxxxxx. xxxxxxxxxxxx proposes the design of a torpor-inducing xxxxxx transfer habitat and an architectural-level assessment to fully characterize the impact to xxxxxx exploration. The habitat is envisioned as a very small, pressurized module that is docked around a central node/airlock permitting direct access to the xxxxxx ascent/descent vehicle and Earth entry capsule by the crew. We believe the crew habitat mass can be reduced to only 5-7 mt (for a crew of 4-6), compared to 20-50 mt currently. The total habitat module volume would be on the order of 20 m3, compared to 200 m3 for most current designs. An end-to-end xxxxxx mission architecture will be evaluated using the new habitat design. For comparison purposes, technology assumptions being used in other ongoing xxxxxx studies will be used. This human-stasis option will then be compared with various Design xxxxxxence Architectures (DRAs) to quantify the impact and merits of the approach.	13982
Impact Resistant Composite Structures for Space Suit Applications, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	Composites Automation (CA) and partners xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx Center for Composite Materials (UD-CCM) and xxxxxx, propose to evaluate innovative composite material and structure concepts that improve impact performance for space suite hard composite components. A systematic experimental screening methodology in xxxxxx I, followed by detailed design and assessment in xxxxxx. Material innovations  evaluated in this effort include hybrid laminate constructions, interlayers and thin-ply composite laminates; as well as potential synergistic combinations. A Low-Velocity Impact (LVI) protocol will be used in combination with leak resistance checks to evaluate concepts and guide composite design. A two-stage methodology is proposed with initial screening of concepts under equivalent conditions for comparative assessment, followed by performance limit assessment (maximum impact energy with no leak).	13983
Microfabricated, 94 GHz, 25 W, Helical Traveling Wave Tube, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Teraphysics Corporation proposes to design and develop a microfabricated, 94 GHz, 25 W traveling wave tube (TWT) with 53% efficiency for xxxxxx applications.  In xxxxxx I, we plan to prove feasibility by completing electrical designs of all major components.  In xxxxxx, we would complete the mechanical design, fabrication, assembly, and test of a laboratory model.  To successfully complete this program, Teraphysics will apply our expertise in vacuum electronics focusing in mm-wave and THz devices; expertise in high level, three-dimensional, computational modeling; novel, patent protected, helical TWT designs for mm-wave and THz operation; and novel, patent protected, helical TWT microfabrication techniques. In xxxxxx I, the technology will advance from xxxxxx 2 to 3.	13984
Sustainable Water Purification, Phase I	2017-06-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx developed phase-engineered and low dimensional materials have opened the door to the design of materials structures that exhibit extremely efficient ionic transport.  Recently, a new type of electro-filtration system designed to convert thermal power into purified water from salt water (or other ionic pollutants) has been demonstrated in the lab.  The system is based on a bi-phasic nanoplatelette form of the compound xxxxxx (xxxxxx disulphide).  Specifically engineering a single film of hexagonal xxxxxx that transitions into tetragonal xxxxxx, one of which is hydrophobic and one strongly hydrophilic, liquids such as water can be moved through the film.  When this film is placed in a thermal gradient, a thermoelectric voltage is established that can be used to thereby remove ions within the water as it exits the material system.  So the entire system is powered through the xxxxxx effect and for small samples this has been shown.  In this program we will attempt to demonstrate a scaleup of the concept using a small canister the size of a writing pen.  When one end is dipped into the water the thermal gradient between that end and the one in air, caused by differences in the convectivity, will power the exchange of ions and purify the water for drinking. xxxxxx will work in collaboration with its academic partners at Wake Forest xxxxxxersity on this project.	13985
Testing Mechanical Countermeasures for Cephalad Fluid Shifts	2017-05-01	2018-07-19	Current evidence suggests that xxxxxx visual impairment and intracranial pressure (VIIP) risk is related to an elevation in intracranial pressure (ICP) during spaceflight, either consequent to or aggravated by cephalad fluid shifts in microgravity. From recent data, VIIP occurs in >50% of astronauts, to varying degrees, and can lead to long term visual changes. xxxxxxhough its cause is unknown, its importance is high enough to motivate studies of potential countermeasures. The key objectives of this project are therefore: (1) to test and help validate two commercial devices as mechanical countermeasures for cephalad fluid shifts to potentially treat elevated ICP, (2) identify any potential adverse consequences during use or following release of such countermeasures, and (3) optimize deployment procedures for such countermeasures.     The xxxxxxns currently use xxxxxx, an elastic thigh band, to help sequester blood in the legs and alleviate symptoms resulting from cephalad fluid shifts. While promising, this device has not been tested as a VIIP countermeasure. Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) is an alternative approach, which draws fluid into the legs using vacuum mechanism. Both have drawbacks, however. xxxxxx devices are custom-built, difficult to obtain and have limited calibration options. LBNP is bulky and hence only one such device would be available in-flight at a time, limiting the number of astronauts who could use it, or the duration of use, each day. As an alternative to xxxxxx, we will test the Kaatsu thigh cuff system. This commercially available system is designed for enhanced muscle training on Earth. Instead of the LBNP alternative, we will investigate use of a LymphaPress compression garment configured to provide a vascular resistance for fluid return (as opposed to enhanced fluid return) from the lower body. In Experiment 1, we will conduct tests using both potential countermeasures in healthy subjects undergoing head-down tilt (HDT) to elevate ICP by +10 mmHg, and in neurointensive care unit (NeuroICU) patients with invasive ICP devices implanted to monitor and treat elevated ICP. We will establish the ICP, cerebral blood flow, intraocular pressure, structural eye parameters, and cerebral vascular parameter changes associated with application, maintenance, and release of each countermeasure. This will also enable calibration of our non-invasive versus invasive cerebral measurements. In Experiment 2, we will examine more gradual discontinuation of device use versus more abrupt discontinuation. In Experiment 3, we will seek to quantify the relationship between exposure time to the countermeasure and cerebral responses during exposure as well as post-release.     Together, these studies will help identify whether either countermeasure is a promising treatment for, or mitigator of, cephalad fluid shifts and elevated ICP. This project will increase the technology readiness level of mechanical countermeasures for VIIP from Countermeasure Readiness xxxxxx (CRL) 4 to CRL 6-7.  Current evidence suggests that xxxxxx visual impairment and intracranial pressure (VIIP) risk is related to an elevation in intracranial pressure (ICP) during spaceflight, either consequent to or aggravated by cephalad fluid shifts in microgravity. The key objectives of this project are therefore: (1) to test and assess two commercial devices as mechanical countermeasures for cephalad fluid shifts to potentially treat elevated ICP, (2) identify any potential adverse consequences during use or following release of such countermeasures, and (3) optimize deployment procedures for such countermeasures. Specifically, this work will test the following two commercial devices for their effect on cerebral and ocular parameters: the Kaatsu thigh cuff muscle training system, as an alternative to xxxxxx, and a reconfigured LymphaPress system designed for fluid management in edema patients.     In year 1 of the project we: (1) obtained the commercial devices and learned in detail how they function, (2) adapted either the physical device or (when possible) normal-use protocols for our target ICP-related application, (3) conducted pilot studies to fine-tune suitable protocols for deployment, (4) worked closely with the clinical teams at both xxxxxx (xxxxxx xxxxxxral Hospital) and Baylor College of Medicine to work out deployment requirements in clinical settings, and (5) finalized the device deployment protocols. Instead of using a standard Kaatsu protocol on the legs, which involves restriction of arterial inflow to the extremeties, we will use a lower pressure to restrict only venous outflow. Instead of the standard LymphaPress configuration of compressing fluids from the lower body to the abdomen, we will compress the abdomen area only to increase vascular resistance, enhance distal vascular dilation, and generate fluid sequestration in the lower body. Having completed device training, initial adaptation, protocol development phase, and pilot studies, we are about to initiate subject recruitment for the primary studies.	13986
Radiation Hard Electronics for Advanced Communication Systems, Phase I	2011-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxanced reconfigurable/reprogrammable communication systems will require use of commercial sub 100 nm electronics.  Legacy radiation tolerant circuits fail to provide xxxxxx (SEU) immunity at speeds greater than 500 MHz.  xxxxxx base level logic circuits are needed to provide SEU immunity for high speed circuits afforded by sub 100 nm technology.  A completely new circuit and system approach called Self Recovery Logic is proposed for development herein which is able to function at the full speed afforded by the fabrication process and able to tolerate SEU impacts not possible with legacy circuits.  Moreover, a truly fault tolerant system is proposed which is projected to replace Triple xxxxxx Redundancy as the on-chip means for fault tolerance.  With the proposed building blocks in place, advanced reconfigurable and reprogrammable high speed devices can be implemented.  A multiprocessor with advanced error correction and data compression capability is proposed for future development.	13987
Aircraft Proximity Maps Based on Data-Driven Flow Modeling	2011-02-07	2018-07-19	"With the forecast increase in air traffic demand over the next decades, it is imperative to develop tools to provide traffic flow managers with the information required to support decision making. In particular, decision-support tools for traffic flow management should aid in limiting controller workload and complexity, while supporting increases in air traffic throughput. While many decision-support tools exist for short-term traffic planning, few have addressed the strategic needs for medium- and long-term planning for time horizons greater than 30 minutes. This paper seeks to address this gap through the introduction of 3D aircraft proximity maps that evaluate the future probability of presence of at least one or two aircraft at any given point of the airspace. Three types of proximity maps are presented: presence maps that indicate the local density of traffic; conflict maps that determine locations and probabilities of potential conflicts; and outliers maps that evaluate the probability of conflict due to aircraft not belonging to dominant traffic patterns. These maps provide traffic flow managers with information relating to the complexity and difficulty of managing an airspace. The intended purpose of the maps is to anticipate how aircraft flows will interact, and how outliers impact the dominant traffic flow for a given time period. This formulation is able to predict which \"critical\" regions may be subject to conflicts between aircraft, thereby requiring careful monitoring. These probabilities are computed using a generative aircraft flow model. Time-varying flow characteristics, such as geometrical configuration, speed, and probability density function of aircraft spatial distribution within the flow, are determined from archived Enhanced Traffic Management xxxxxx data, using a tailored clustering algorithm. xxxxxx not belonging to flows are identified as outliers."	13988
Pistonless Pumps for Nanosat Launch and Sample Return Vehicles, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	This proposal responds to the request for pumps for pressure-fedpropulsion systems with a pistonless pump wherein a pressurant actdirectly on the propellant(s) in a set of  pump chambers.  The pumpsystem will work for both in-space and spacecraft descent and ascentsystems, and it is applicable to nanosat launch vehicle (NLV)technologies as well. When integrated into a full propulsion system,this pump will increase payload mass fraction, reliability, safety, andoperating flexibility.  The same pump can be used for the main engine,attitude control thrusters, and fuel transfer, since the pump providesvariable pressure at variable flow without using extra consumables. Thepistonless design avoids sliding seals, which can cause problems forpiston pumps. No precision components are needed, and all activecomponents can be redundant and/or contamination-tolerant.  For spacetransportation or launch vehicle systems with liquid/supercriticalhelium and/or multi-stage autogenous pressurization,  &quot;systemxxxxxx&quot; including pressurant and tank mass can be intermediate betweengas-generator and staged combustion turbopump systems, but at much lowercost and complexity than with either of those types. The pump hasalready been designed, built and tested under lab conditions, pumpingkerosene, liquid nitrogen and water. The performance improvements due toinclusion of the pump in various systems have already been analyzed.The purpose of this xxxxxx is to bring the pistonless pump technology upto a xxxxxx 5 level and integrate it into a nanosat launch vehicle. Thework to be done consists of designing, building and testing pumpfeatures for operation under vibration, acceleration and reducedabsolute pressure environments. The pump will then be integrated into aprototype NLV first stage and a full duration ground test will beconducted.  If the budget is sufficient,  we will conduct a flight testto 50,000 ft. The flight test pump and data will be delivered to xxxxxx	13989
Game Changing Usage of High-Voltage Power Transmission Systems as Extremely Large Antennas for Space Physical and Geophysical Remote Imaging	2013-10-01	2018-07-19	We propose to use the US high-voltage power transmission system as an extremely large antenna to extract unprecedented spatiotemporal space physical and geological information from distributed geomagnetically induced current (GIC) observations. The power grid impacts are presently the highest space weather concern in US and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's ongoing regulatory action will drive substantial industry and federal interests in the GIC problem in the near future. Consequently, the proposed game changing GIC observations set up offers not only opportunity for new big heliophysics science utilizing industrial structures but also potential for major interagency and public-private collaborations.Geomagnetic storms drive geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) in high-voltage power transmission systems worldwide. GIC distribution in the transmission system is a function of the large-scale surface geoelectric field and DC characteristics of the transmission system. Geoelectric field carries information about magnetospheric-ionospheric electric current systems and geological structures. It is common to use information about magnetospheric-ionospheric electric current systems or geomagnetic field variations on the ground together with geological and transmission system description to model GIC. xxxxxxver, no work or technology exists for inverting spatiotemporal space physical and geological information from extensive distributed GIC observations. We will utilize the US high-voltage power transmission system for the first time as a science tool to map large scale GIC's. Large-scale application of the set up will allow unprecedented, game changing, extraction of space physical and geological information over wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Further, the new GIC observation set up can be turned into a valuable resource for the power transmission industry. We envision that the large-scale implementation of the concept can be carried out in collaboration with the industry and other federal agencies after the 1-year pilot phase. With sufficient funds, full-scale implementation of the concept with a larger number of GIC observation sites can be achieved within 2-3 years after the pilot phase.  	13990
Mission Design and Orbit Maintenance Strategies in the Earth-Moon System	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	The successes of xxxxxx's xxxxxxyaan probe and xxxxxx xxxxxx have generated a renewed interest in the lunar surface. And, while a number of missions such as ISEE-3, MAP, and xxxxxx have exploited the region near xxxxxx libration points, no spacecraft had ever reached and remained in the vicinity of an xxxxxxxxxxxx libration point until the ARTEMIS mission successfully inserted into an xxxxxx orbit in August of 2010. Given the continued success of the ARTEMIS probes and the potential future uses of libration point orbits as platforms for communication and scientific activities, it seems likely that interest in xxxxxxxxxxxx libration point orbits will only continue to increase. To best meet future mission requirements in this regime, efficient, strategies algorithms coupled with a better overall understanding of this complicated dynamical environment are required. Continuing innovation in this area is critical to achieving xxxxxx future goals in the xxxxxxxxxxxx system in the areas of space science, communication and exploration.Given the chaotic, dynamically sensitive nature of the xxxxxxxxxxxx problem, flexible and robust numerical algorithms are critical to mission design and orbit maintenance strategies. Due to the unstable nature of most libration point orbits in this system, numerically integrated trajectory segments will eventually depart the intended orbit. The period of the current orbits of interest are approximately two weeks, thus, stationkeeping maneuvers are required every one to two weeks to maintain the spacecraft in the vicinity of the xxxxxxxxxxxx libration points. Current strategies typically target an orbit condition one to two revolutions in the future and it is possible that a maneuver may create undesirable changes in the orbit at a later time. The use of multiple trajectory segments, however, delivers a differential corrections process to efficiently and effectively design a maneuver that targets the entire remaining path along the planned trajectory. This global-type approach ensures that planned maneuvers do not disrupt the remaining trajectory arcs or negatively impact the end-of-mission goals (lunar arrival conditions, for example).Design strategies and algorithms will also be developed to systematically explore the most productive modification of a highly sensitive trajectory in the xxxxxxxxxxxx system due to planned or unplanned events. For example, the ARTEMIS mission has demonstrated that the evolution of the out-of-plane amplitude of an xxxxxxxxxxxx libration orbit can evolve in dramatically different ways in the presence of even small errors in position and/or velocity. The current remedy in response to this problem involves manual testing of various maneuver locations and magnitudes. xxxxxxver, modifying a corrections algorithm used previously to study xxxxxxxxxxxx transfer trajectories, delta-V maneuvers can be inserted at locations along the trajectory automatically and a type of xxxxxx analysis completed. The total delta-V cost can then be lowered and, in doing so, the most efficient maneuver location(s) become more apparent. This process is straightforward but extremely nontrivial in such a numerically sensitive regime. This same procedure is also applicable in altering lunar arrival conditions or coordinating the rendezvous of two spacecraft in separate libration point orbits.	13991
Improved Rhenium Thrust Chambers for In-Space Propulsion, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Radiation-cooled, bipropellant thrust chambers are being considered for the ascent/descent engines and reaction control systems (RCS) for future xxxxxx missions such as xxxxxx.  Currently, iridium-lined rhenium combustion chambers are the state-of-the-art for in-space engines. xxxxxx xxxxxxanced Materials Bipropellant xxxxxx (AMBR) engine, a xxxxxx rhenium-iridium chamber produced by xxxxxx, xxxxxx. (PPI) and xxxxxx, recently set a hydrazine specific impulse record of 333.5 seconds.  To withstand the high loads during terrestrial launch, rhenium chambers with improved mechanical properties are needed, i.e., 40ksi yield strength and 10% elongation at room temperature.  Recent electrochemical forming (EL-Form) work has shown considerable promise for improving the mechanical properties of rhenium by producing a multi-layered deposit comprised of a tailored microstructure, i.e., xxxxxx.  In addition, the multi-component processing ability of the EL-Form process has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of producing advanced rhenium-iridium thrust chambers.  Therefore, PPI and its industry partner, xxxxxx, will work together to develop rhenium based in-space engines with improved mechanical properties at a reduced cost.	13992

Low-Cost, Integrated Ground Test, Simulation, and Flight Control Development Environment, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	An important mission for xxxxxx is the development of revolutionary flight concepts and technology.  The development of xxxxxx unmanned air vehicles (MAVs) and xxxxxx aircraft has received considerable attention recently.  Unlike conventional aircraft, MAVs and xxxxxx aircraft suffer from operation in an extremely low xxxxxx number flight regime.  xxxxxxrally, a low xxxxxx number is considered to be between 150,000 and 500,000.  Both MAVs and xxxxxx aircraft, however, can have operational xxxxxx number regimes from 20,000 to 120,000.  At these extremely low xxxxxx numbers, the aerodynamic flow features are dominated by laminar separation and separation bubble effects, which are highly unstable and very dependent upon the free-stream conditions and atmospheric turbulence.  xxxxxxhough it is often argued that an exploratory vehicle will operate over a benign portion of the flight envelope, an encounter with strong winds or gusts, particularly during a maneuver, could excite a highly non-linear response.  This means that the assumption of linear derivatives for stability and control may not be valid, which could cause the loss of a vehicle designed with a control system based on linear assumptions.  It is proposed that a low-cost, integrated ground test, simulation, and flight control development environment be created to address these challenges.	13994
Micromechanical Models for Composite NDE and Diagnostics, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx aircraft increasingly rely on composite components, due to their excellent material properties.  xxxxxxver, fastening/joining and design methodologies in current use are artifacts of metallic aircraft component use and are not yet optimized for use with composites.  Furthermore, limitations in our current ability to observe manufacturing quality and in-service damage evolution of composite structures may prevent designers from realizing their full potential. Current NDE practices are incapable of overcoming these limitations. Thus, a new framework and methodology is needed for high resolution imaging and tracking of manufacturing quality and damage evolution.The goal of this program is to enable assessment of the matrix, fiber, and bonding conditions for composites using a combination of detailed physics based models, high resolution imaging, and controlled loading sources to isolate the composite characteristic of interest.  In xxxxxx I we will focus on magnetic field sensing (i.e., eddy-current) methods that can be combined with structural analysis to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of these NDE methods.  xxxxxx and MR&D are well-positioned to deliver this methodology in the form of commercial software and NDE equipment.  We will also work with a major aircraft OEM to maintain our focus on practical solutions to high priority needs.	13995
Cloud-Based Electronic Test Procedures, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxedures are critical to experimental tests as they describe the specific steps necessary to efficiently and safely carry out a test in a repeatable fashion.  The procedure process includes creating test procedures, validating those procedures, executing the procedures during a test, and then analyzing and auditing the results. Relying on paper-based test procedures hampers data collection and distributed teamwork during test operations  In xxxxxx I of this project, xxxxxx prototyped a cloud-based electronic test procedure system that provides procedures via web browsers on tablets or laptops and guides the operator through the procedure step-by-step. xxxxxx also implemented a CAN bus interface between its electronic test procedure system and test hardware. This allows data from the test hardware to be displayed in-line with the procedure and for the procedure to send commands to the test hardware. xxxxxx will extend the electronic test procedure system in xxxxxx and integrate with xxxxxx Airxxxxxxt aeronautics test facility.	13996

For each type, one or more averaging intervals are available.	13997
The Gravity Loading Countermeasure Skinsuit	2016-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxs lose considerable bone mass during long duration spaceflight. These losses are one of the major concerns for proposed exploration class missions to the xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and xxxxxx due to the increase in fracture risk associated with reduced bone strength. These losses are seen even with the intervention of current exercise countermeasures. xxxxxxhough it is possible that the newest exercise machine, the xxxxxxanced xxxxxxistive Exercise Device (ARED), will be more effective in preventing bone and muscle losses, its size may be prohibitive in bringing it on interplanetary missions. In order for astronauts to be able to perform successful exploration tasks, they need to arrive at their destinations healthy and capable of doing work. Because of this, new countermeasures will need to be developed to prevent musculoskeletal deconditioning.The goal of this proposal is to meet this need by producing a wearable countermeasure suit. The suits primary goal will be to impose static loading, similar to that produced by gravity, on the user. In addition, incorporating a dynamic loading component, such as a form of vibration, may enhance the effectiveness of the suit. Finally, integrating the suit with existing countermeasures could serve to improve the overall efficacy of the entire countermeasure program. While astronauts currently exercise for around 2 hours, this suit could be worn for a longer period of time, including while the astronauts are performing other tasks. The suits will also be lightweight and easily packable, which is a major consideration for space exploration missions. The research objectives of this proposal are as follows: To produce a comprehensive model of suit-body interactions to aid in suit design To investigate the integration of the suit with existing countermeasures To investigate forms of dynamic loading, and their effects on subject comfort and performance To build and characterize prototype countermeasure suits The model from aim 1 will be created using xxxxxx and body modeling software, and will be used to inform suit design. It will be used to compute the effects of integrating the suit with existing countermeasures on overall suit characteristics. Dynamic loading mechanisms will be evaluated on their loading qualities and influence on subject comfort and performance. After the suits are constructed, their loading and comfort traits will be characterized.The Gravity xxxxxxing Countermeasure Skinsuit will reduce the musculoskeletal deconditioning seen during long duration spaceflight, allowing for a more robust and effective exploration program. The technologies developed in this proposal will also have applications in the medical field, for treating bed rest patients and in healing musculoskeletal injuries.	13998

Demonstration of Fission Product Retention in a Novel NTR Fuel, Phase II	2007-06-01	2018-07-19	Several studies over the past few decades have recognized the need for advanced propulsion to explore the solar system.  As early as the 1960s, xxxxxx and others recognized the need for a nuclear rocket for sending humans to xxxxxx.  The great distances, the intense radiation levels, and the physiological response to zero-gravity all supported the concept of using a nuclear rocket to decrease mission time.  These same needs have been recognized in later studies, especially in the xxxxxx Exploration Initiative in 1989.  One of the key questions that has arisen in later studies, however, is the need to utilize a nuclear fuel form that does not emit fission products into the exhaust stream.  Unlike the xxxxxx/NERVA programs in the 1960s, the rocket exhaust in a current day nuclear rocket should contain no radioactivity. We will investigate a series of coated fuel forms that will inhibit fission products and actinides from diffusing out into the surrounding coolant.  A demonstration experiment will be designed that will allow fuels containing uranium-238 to be fissioned, heated to very high temperatures, and assessed for emission of any products.	14001
PEAC: A Power-Efficient Adaptive Computing Technology for Enabling Swarm of Small Spacecraft and Deployable Mini-Payloads	2012-09-01	2018-07-19	This task is to develop and demonstrate a path-to-flight and power-adaptive avionics technology PEAC (xxxxxx Efficient xxxxxxive Computing). PEAC will enable emerging mission concepts that would otherwise be completely impossible such as formation flying and swarms or constellation of small spacecraft requiring low-power (tens of milli-watts to one-watt) typically powered only by primary batteries.PEAC's novel technical approach is to leverage a low-power processor such as Aeroflex LEON-3 processor or ARM processor augmented with a co-processor, PEAC-xxxxxx, to be developed in this proposal that controls such critical system functions as power management, fault tolerance, and timing synchronization. It is based on observations of three major power-efficiency-limiting factors prevailing in conventional state-of-the-art space avionics: (1) xxxxxx of adaptive, fine-grained, and multiple avionics power operational modes – almost all existing avionics designs support merely on/off power modes at the box-level. Once powered on, it is never powered off, wasting significant amount of energy even during off-duty cycle; (2) xxxxxx of effective usage of inherent low-power features of modern space-grade microelectronics parts such as clock-gating and multiple-power-mode for microprocessors and variable-voltage-scaling for other parts; and (3) xxxxxx of finer-granularity match between the mission operational mode (typically bursty) and the avionics operational mode (typically flat). PEAC's unique innovations are embodied in its three key components: (1) PEAC-xxxxxx: it is a central controller that handles power management, fault tolerance, and timing synchronization. It will provides on-demand and fine-grained power scheduling algorithm capable of trading performance and power consumption at run-time via systematic power management at both board and chip level. In particular, PEAC uses dual power domains: always-on domain – is always powered and provides minimal functions such as timer and CCSDS Critical Relay Command xxxxxx, consumes minimal power of less than 100 µW, and at-times-changed domain – it is managed at runtime with multiple power profiles adapted to various mission operational modes; (2) PEAC-designtime: it is a set of design guidelines of low-power board/firmware/software (such as clock gating, variable voltage scaling, etc.), power-aware RTL IP cores, power-aware.	14002

Barrier Infrared Detector (BIRD)	2012-12-01	2018-07-19	A recent breakthrough in MWIR detector design, has resulted in a high operating temperature (HOT) barrier infrared detector (BIRD) that is capable of spectral coverage of not only the entire MWIR atmospheric transmission window (3 – 5 μm), but also the short-wave infrared (xxxxxx; 1.4 – 3 μm), the near infrared (NIR; 0.75 – 1.4 μm) and the visible bands. While other advanced MWIR detector designs have been able to achieve high temperature operation with 4 μm cutoff wavelength, the JPL invention is unique in that its spectral coverage includes the entire MWIR atmospheric transmission window. JPL will design, fabricate, and fully characterize a 640x512 format HOT-BIRD FPA with increased quantum efficiency and extended spectral coverage. Unlike the small format experimental FPA, the proposed FPA will undergo a substrate removal process which extends the cut-on wavelength into the visible range, as well as paving the way towards very large-format (multi-megapixel) arrays. One advantage of the extended spectral coverage FPA is that it eliminates the need for multiple infrared planes; a single optical train can be used to cover the visible to MWIR spectral bands on imagers, spectrometers, spectral- imagers, and hyper-spectral imagers. The other key advantage is the higher operating temperature, which enables passively cooled operations from low earth orbit (LEO), eliminating the need for active coolers. Passive cooled systems use no moving parts, have no vibrations, and provide better reliability. These advantages lead to a reduction in instrument size, mass, mechanical complexity, optical complexity (i.e., no beam splitters, prisms, etc.) and power requirements.   	14004

Ambient Desorption, Ionization, and Extraction Source for Mars Exploration, Phase I	2018-06-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxxs xxxxxxentific LLC proposes to design, develop, and prototype a miniature ambient desorption, ionization, and extraction source (MADIE) as a compact all-in-one instrument for operation under the ambient xxxxxx environment to sequentially desorb, ionize, and extract analytes from xxxxxx samples. The MADIE will enable in situ interrogation of the xxxxxx mineralogical samples with no sample preparation and/or separation when coupled to a mass spectrometer. At the core of the proposed MADIE will be a self-tuning plasma ionization module for sample ionization, consisting of an ambient carbon dioxide plasma source and a tuning circuit; an ion funnel module for efficient ion extraction; and a laser diode module for time-resolved sample desorption. The ambient plasma source will utilize the xxxxxx atmosphere, which is mainly composed of carbon dioxide, to form a reduced-pressure carbon dioxide inductively coupled plasma (ICP) to ionize the plume of sampled analytes. The tuning circuit will compensate any plasma variation and maintain the plasma source at resonance during operation. The ion funnel module, which will be derived by a radio frequency power supply, will efficiently extract the ions and guide them into the mass spectrometer to increase sensitivity. The laser diode module will produce a plume of sample analytes from the sample surface with high spatial resolution at both ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) wavelengths.  During phase I, the self-tuning plasma ionization module will be designed and constructed, and the ion funnel will be designed and simulated with SIMION and then prototyped. Commercially-available laser modules at various wavelengths will be selected and experimentally validated. These modules will then be pieced together to develop a breadboard prototype of the MADIE by the conclusion of phase I. Preliminary experiments will be conducted to test the efficiency of the MADIE.	14006

The proposed xxxxxx xxxxxx I project addresses an innovative torrefaction (mild pyrolysis) processing approach that can be used to sterilize feces, control odor, and produce a stable, free flowing powder that can be easily stored or recycled, while simultaneously recovering all of the moisture, producing additional water, and only small amounts of other gases (xxxxxx, CO, xxxxxx) and liquids. The overall objective of the xxxxxx I program is to demonstrate the feasibility of a near full (1/3) scale integrated xxxxxx Collection/xxxxxxefaction (WC/T) unit for fecal waste streams. The xxxxxx I work will be accomplished in three tasks: 1) test unit design and construction; 2) laboratory testing on relevant waste streams; 3) evaluation and preliminary xxxxxx prototype design. This work plan will address the key questions about the WC/T unit feasibility for the application to human fecal waste and related solid waste streams.  In addition, the torrefaction method can be applied using the same or similar conditions to other types of wet or dry cellulosic biomass (food, paper, wipes, clothing) which provides for some desirable redundancy in the waste management system. xxxxxx prototype will be compatible with the xxxxxxersal xxxxxx Management xxxxxx (UWMS) and complementary to the xxxxxx (HMC), both now under development by xxxxxx. The torrefaction process can also be accomplished with minimal crew interactions, modest energy requirements and will be able to tolerate mixed or contaminated waste streams.	14008

Regenerative Gas Dryer for Integrated ISRU Systems	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx propellant can be produced anywhere that water is found by splitting it into hydrogen and oxygen, potentially saving several tons of mass per mission and enabling the long term presence of humans in space beyond LEO. When water is split into hydrogen and oxygen, the gaseous products can be very humid (several thousand ppm). Propellant-grade gases need to be extremely dry before being converted into cryogenic liquids. The primary objective of this project is to design, build and test a regenerative gas drying system that can take humid gas from a water electrolysis system and provide dry gas to the inlet of a liquefaction system for long durations. State of the art work in this area attempted to use vacuum as a means to regenerate desiccant, but it was observed that water would migrate to the dry zone without a sweep gas present to direct the desorbed vapor. Further work attempted to use xxxxxx as a sweep gas, but this resulted in a corrosive carbonic acid. In order for in-situ propellant production to work, we need a way to continuously dry humid gas that addresses these issues.	14012

Device structures as small as tens of nanometer resolution can be printed directly on a single daughterboard. This process significantly simplifies the tedious fabrication process of nanosensors. It also eliminates the integration and packaging challenges associated fabricating individual sensors and then integrating them. In addition, the printing process is automated and can be used to address reproducibility and repeatability challenges typically faced with nanosensors. xxxxxx goals are to characterize the sensor performance using ammonia, hydrogen and methane, and complete data analysis and modeling by the end of the fiscal year.	14014
Environmental and simulation facility conditions can modulate a behavioral-driven altered gravity response of Drosophila imagoes transcriptome	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	Genome-wide transcriptional profiling shows that reducing gravity levels in xxxxxx (xxxxxx) causes important alterations in xxxxxx gene expression. xxxxxxver simulation experiments on ground without space constraints show weaker effects than space environment. A global and integrative analysis using the gene expression dynamics inspector (xxxxxxI) self-organizing maps reveals a subtle response of the transcriptome using different populations and microgravity and hypergravity simulation devices. These results suggest that in addition to behavioural responses that can be detected also at the gene expression level the transcriptome is finely tuned to normal gravity. The alteration of this constant parameter on Earth can have effects on gene expression that depends both on the environmental conditions and the ground based facility used to compensate the gravity vector. xxxxxxernative and commons effects of mechanical facilities like the Random Positioning xxxxxx and a centrifuge and strong magnetic field ones like a cryogenically cooled superconductive magnet are discussed. We compare the effects over the gene expression profile of different gender/age xxxxxx imagoes in 3-4 days-long experiments under altered gravity conditions into three GBF (xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx for micro/hyper- gravity simulation) using whole genome microarray platforms. Descriptions of different GBFs (treatments): LDC means xxxxxx. xxxxxx can be placed under three conditions: inside LDC (at certain g level) at the LDC rotational control and at external 1g control (outside the LDC). xxxxxx means Random Positioning xxxxxx. xxxxxx can be placed under two conditions: inside xxxxxx (at nearly 0g xxxxxx level) and at external 1g control (outside the xxxxxx). At the magnet means INxxxxxx the xxxxxxic levitator (another GBF). xxxxxx can be placed under four conditions: inside xxxxxx 0g* (at microgravity with magnetic field) inside xxxxxx at 1g* (internal control with magnetic field) or inside the magnet 2g* (at hypergravity with magnetic field) and at external 1g control (outside the magnet)	14015

In addition, the realization of a low power highly integrated RF front end for space applications will enable large beam forming arrays to provide the necessary signal to noise ratio to produce ocean altimetry and scatterometry observations.  We will enable constellations of low power satellites that would dramatically increase weather prediction ability.  A small low power RO instrument will enable easier accommodation on missions of opportunity.The proposed design will support four RF inputs capable of receiving three GNSS signals per input in a single application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). xxxxxx RF channels on a GNSS receiver IC is a unique feature which enables precision beam forming.

Prognostic Health-Management System Development for Electromechanical Actuators	2015-06-10	2018-07-19	xxxxxx-mechanical actuators (EMAs) have been gaining increased acceptance as safety-critical actuation devices in the next generation of aircraft and spacecraft.  The aerospace manufacturers are not ready, however, to completely embrace EMAs for all applications due to apprehension with regard to some of the more critical fault modes.  This work aims to help address these concerns by developing and testing a prognostic health management system that diagnoses EMA faults and employs prognostic algorithms to track fault progression and predict the actuator remaining useful life. The diagnostic algorithm is implemented using a combined model-based and data-driven reasoner. The prognostic algorithm, implemented using xxxxxx xxxxxxess Regression, estimates the remaining life of the faulted component. The paper also covers the selection of fault modes for coverage and methods developed for fault injection. xxxxxx experiments were conducted both in laboratory and flight conditions using the Flyable xxxxxxmechanical xxxxxx (FLEA) test stand. The FLEA allows test actuators to be subjected to realistic environmental and operating conditions, while providing the capability to safely inject and monitor propagation of various fault modes. The paper covers both diagnostic and prognostic, run-to-failure experiments, conducted in laboratory and flight conditions for several types of faults. The experiments demonstrated robust fault diagnosis on the selected set of component and sensor faults and high-accuracy predictions of failure time in prognostic scenarios.	14019
Simulating Regolith Excavation, Entrainment, Dispersal and Visibility Impairment due to Rocket Plume-Surface Interaction via a Hybrid Continuum-Rarefied Flow Solver	2019-08-01	2018-07-19	With xxxxxx planning to redirect an asteroid and possible future missions to the xxxxxx or xxxxxx satellites, the effects of thruster plume impingement on the surfaces of these bodies must be better understood. xxxxxx firings near a regolith-covered surface will scour and accelerate dust and larger particles, creating a spray of debris that endangers the spacecraft and any nearby equipment. These particle jets may degrade thermal coatings and solar arrays, clog or damage robotic actuators, and severely reduce the effectiveness of optical sensors. Without accurate modeling of this particle behavior, mitigation techniques and safe operational plans cannot be developed.The objectives of my research are: (1) to determine how interactions between variably-oriented unsteady plumes and realistic surfaces can effect the far field distribution of debris, (2) understand and quantify the effect of entrained dust on larger [~0.1-1 cm] pebble-like particles on the surface and the hazard this may pose, and (3) determine how lofted dust degrades the performance of optical instruments and astronaut visibility.xxxxxx plume interaction with the surface of an asteroid or moon involves a variety of complex phenomena including continuumto rarefied transition, multiphase flow, light scattering, and gas-surface interaction. xxxxxx proven xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Relaxation (DPLR) CFD code will be used handle the supersonic continuum flow exiting the rocket nozzle. This flow will then be handed off to an in-house direct simulation xxxxxx (xxxxxx) code that models the continued expansion of the plume into the rarefied regime. Dust particles will be treated as a separate species in the flow with accurate mass and conservation of momentum characteristics. Using a single photon light scattering code, the optical properties of the dust cloud will be determined.The software resulting from this research will add a considerable new analysis capability for missions at objects in deep space, substantially improving safety and performance. It will allow the development of follow-on mitigation devices and guide the development of in-space operational strategies.	14020
Modeling Turbulence Effects in Cryogenic Propellant Tank Thermal Management, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	Control and management of cryogenic propellant tank pressures in low gravity is an important technical challenge to overcome for future long duration space missions. xxxxxxanced techniques such as thermodynamic vent systems (TVS) are currently being designed for low-gravity space systems, and advanced computational tools are required to analyze the complex multi-phase physics involved. The proposed effort extends computational fluid dynamics capabilities to consider the behavior and effects of turbulence on heat/mass transfer at the tank gas/liquid interface and dispersed-phase droplet vaporization.  xxxxxx extensions to fundamental kinetics-based mass transfer models are investigated for application to cryogenic systems. The methodology will be tested with the CRUNCH CFD code which incorporates real-fluid equations-of-state for cryogenic fluid mixtures with rigorous fluid property definitions, and an advanced dispersed phase spray model that permits non-equilibrium mass, drag, and heat transfer with the surrounding continuum fluid.  The models improvements will be readily transferable to alternate codes and support unsteady RANS simulations in an xxxxxxian-based gas/liquid framework. This technology will support cryogenic system analysis for long duration space exploration activities.	14021

A Distributed Resilient Autonomous Framework for Manned/Unmanned Trajectory-Based Operations, Phase II	2018-04-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx, working in collaboration with xxxxxx Aviation, xxxxxx., proposes to develop a prototype system for planning xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxs (UAS) trajectories based on user intent and preference information. The system, called DRIFT-UAS (Distributed xxxxxx Framework for xxxxxx Management of xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxs), is intended to support autonomous Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) under xxxxxx-xxxxxx Operations (TBO). It is composed of algorithms and information-sharing components that enable autonomous trajectory planning while optimizing system-wide objectives such as safety, efficiency, and equity. DRIFT-UAS works for a mixed environment (manned and unmanned aircraft), but special emphasis is placed on xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxs (UAS). The immediate application is primarily targeted at lower-altitude aircraft (below 18,000 feet) but DRIFT-UAS would apply as well to upper altitudes.Using DRIFT-UAS, flight operators and air traffic management iteratively exchange trajectory intent and congestion feedback to develop trajectories that are efficient and equitable, while preserving an aircraft's autonomy in generating its own trajectories based on its internal objective tradeoffs. The feedback aspect of the DRIFT-UAS architecture separates it from other 'evaluators', i.e., systems that check whether operating constraints are violated given a set of trajectories. Once DRIFT-UAS checks the proposed trajectories against system constraints, it provides each aircraft with information via a price update on levels of congestion and system constraints in space and time that would enable the aircraft to revise its trajectory if required. This two-way communication between aircraft and air traffic management on trajectory intent and feasibility results in better trajectories as well as clearer guidance to airspace users as to which trajectories are most likely to be available.	14025

Our technologies fit hand in glove with xxxxxx new strategy and will be a key enabler in making xxxxxx vision of pioneering the space frontier a reality because they are the only economically feasible approach to building habitats that can grow, spin, and manufacture in space.This NIAC xxxxxx effort will perform critical proof of concept studies, analysis, and ground demonstrations to prove the feasibility of xxxxxx (GATS) and their benefit for xxxxxx evolvable proving ground approach to human exploration. As part of this effort we will conduct mission studies showing how a version 1.0 outpost in xxxxxx Distance Retrograde Orbit (LDRO) made from GATS can grow and evolve while utilizing asteroid resources for radiation shielding and later integrate with an asteroid ISRU system such as the NIAC funded xxxxxx architecture proposed by Sercel. We will perform mission analysis in collaboration with Sercel showing how asteroid regolith slag left over from the production of rocket propellant can be accumulated over time in LDRO and integrated as radiation shielding into the structure of the GATS based evolvable outpost thereby saving many billions of dollars in launch costs and helping to make xxxxxx program of human exploration more affordable.The critical enabling technology for our GATS technology is Tensegrity xxxxxxing, where new design methods, new dynamic models, and new control approaches are specialized for networks of axially-loaded elements, allowing the structural mass to be minimized, while the dynamic response can be controlled with minimal energy, with repairable, growable structural methods, using tractableanalytical tools that are now available. We also capitalize on asteroid resources for radiation shielding of our habitat. This NIAC xxxxxx effort will perform critical proof of concept studies, analysis, and ground demonstrations to prove the feasibility of xxxxxx (GATS) and their benefit for xxxxxx evolvable proving ground approach to human exploration.	14026

Research of Off-Nominal Airport Traffic Management using a Surface Management System-Based Simulation, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	The proposed project is complimentary and directly beneficial to xxxxxx Safe and Efficient xxxxxx Operations (SESO) research.  xxxxxx has previously developed a modular architecture for testing airport control concepts and algorithms within the xxxxxx Management xxxxxx (SMS).  xxxxxxver, SMS currently uses live or pre-recorded surveillance data and, therefore, must be connected to a separate simulation environment.  We will develop a self-contained, fast-time SMS simulation environment by incorporating an aircraft taxi model.  The proposed stand-alone platform would complement xxxxxx current SMS-ATG environment by providing a fast-time simulation capability that uses the desired SMS plug-in architecture.  We will also develop and integrate within the SMS simulation departure scheduling and taxi planning algorithms.  These algorithms will supplement xxxxxx existing work and be independent of external optimization solvers.  Lastly, the project will apply the fast-time simulation and integrated planning algorithms to study xxxxxx airport surface traffic management under regular and off-nominal conditions, studies that complement xxxxxx research.  xxxxxx was chosen because of its complex geometry and traffic.  We have received permission from the FAA to use xxxxxx data, which is already available to xxxxxx as part of our FAA work.	14028
Three-Dimensional Cockpit Display System for Improved Situational Awareness, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	To improve aviation safety, xxxxxx requires crew-centric technologies that ensure appropriate situational awareness through improved information presentation.  Presenting information by 3D display can significantly facilitate human perception and counteract biases and error-tendencies, leading to improved aviation safety.  To address this xxxxxx need, xxxxxxical xxxxxxics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new 3D xxxxxx (3D-COD) system for aircraft flight decks, based on fast scanning liquid crystal (LC) optics, to create a compact multiuser, multiperspective 3D display system that has no moving parts and requires no 3D glasses.

Piezoelectric MEMS Microphones for Ground Testing of Aeronautical Systems, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Improving the acoustical environment is critical in aeronautics. Airports and aeronautical systems manufacturers are facing ever-increasing demands to reduce noise levels.  xxxxxx applications require the use of large arrays of high quality microphones with a large dynamic range.  These arrays are expensive.  The advent of lower cost microphones that meet the users' specifications would dramatically improve the ability of engineers seeking to quantify the acoustic impact of either their designs or their facilities (e.g., airports) to make data driven decisions to improve any adverse conditions. We seek to develop commercially viable, piezeoelectric micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) microphones capable of withstanding the high amplitude sound pressure levels and adverse environmental conditions found in ground testing of the acoustics of aeronautical systems.  The acoustical specifications of these microphones (measured by noise floor, linearity, sensitivity) will met or exceed those of existing microphones.  Our microphone is a shift from the capacitive sensing scheme that is used in nearly every microphone in use today.  xxxxxx microphones have significant advantages, over an above their small size (<4 mm x mm). xxxxxx microphones require no polarization (unlike capacitive sensors), a significant price advantage when considering implementation in large arrays.  In addition, the piezoelectric MEMS microphones can withstand the higher temperatures needed for lead-free re-flow soldering -- a significant advantage over electrets (that cannot withstand these high temperatures).  This microphone, therefore, holds the promise of superior acoustical performance, lower cost than current technology, ease of implementation into large arrays, and seamless integration into modern microelectronics manufacturing procedures.	14031

In xxxxxx I, we seek to develop an innovative network-based xxxxxx xxxxxxiology Software tool, leveraging an ongoing xxxxxx funded lab-on-a-chip system design effort.  In the proof-of-concept study, a physiologically relevant component network representing elements of the human circulatory system will be assembled in a user-friendly GUI environment. This network, interfaced with high-fidelity multiphysics software (CFD-ACE+) will be solved for detailed analysis of local hemodynamic stresses on vascular endothelial cell structure, and compute microgravity effects on fluid shift. In xxxxxx, component models will be refined with detailed representation for arterial, venous and lymphatic effects, along with incorporation of metabolite transport and baroreflex models.  xxxxxx to systems biology models (cellular regulatory networks) will also be developed.

"Development of a \"Digital Bridge\" Thermal Anemometer for Turbulence Measurements, Phase II"	2017-11-01	2018-07-19	"Thermal anemometry (a.k.a. hot-wire anemometry) has been a key experimental technique in fluid mechanics for many decades. Due to the small physical size and high frequency response of the sensors (resulting in excellent spatial and temporal resolution), the technique has been widely used for studies of turbulent flows. Even with the advent of nonintrusive techniques such as xxxxxx xxxxxx (LDV) and xxxxxx Image Velocimetry (PIV), hot wire anemometry is uniquely capable of extremely high frequency response and fine spatial resolution measurements. ViGYAN has demonstrated a fundamental change to the anemometer configuration, with two related aspects. First, the circuitry to power the sensor and establish its operating point is packaged immediately adjacent to the sensor, i.e. in the typical probe holder, removing the effect of the cable connecting the sensor to an external anemometer. xxxxxxond, modern analog-digital conversion hardware has been employed to the maximum extent possible,  including directly driving the sensor. xxxxxx transmission is fully digital, immune to environmental variations or electrical noise. xxxxxx on these results, the xxxxxx work will deploy this \"Digital Bridge\" system using a Digital Signal xxxxxx (DSP) device connected via fiber-optic cable the miniaturized \"probe holder\" electronics. The DSP will be controlled by a generic PC with software to control the system and acquire/store data.

Such asteroids are mostly dark, small and cold (~ 200K); so they are best detected in the very longwave infrared (Vxxxxxx) wavelength of ~ 16 microns where they glow brightest. To accomplish this, we propose a new cooled Vxxxxxx focal plane array (FPA) of antimony-based strained layer superlattices (SLS) that will leverage the significant advances in quantum efficiency (QE) and dark current recently achieved by QmagiQ in SLS FPAs with cutoff wavelengths upto 12 microns. Compared to the incumbent mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) technology, SLS promises comparable QE, lower dark current, and much higher array uniformity and operability. Most importantly, it offers superb image stability - which will eliminate the need for frequent non-uniformity correction when using MCT. In xxxxxx I, we will develop and deliver a prototype FPA with 16 micron cutoff. In xxxxxx, we will increase FPA format and deliver a camera to xxxxxx for evaluation.	14045

We propose to develop new gamma-ray and neutron detectors based on wide-band-gap (WBG) solid-state photomultiplier (SSPM) photodetectors coupled to emerging scintillation materials such as Cs2YLiCl6:Ce (CLYC), and CeBr3 for gamma and neutron spectroscopic studies of planet surfaces and small cosmic bodies. The proposed SSPM photodetector for scintillation readout is based on xxxxxx, a WBG compound semiconductor with aluminum concentration of 60% to 90%. The ~2-eV band-gap energy of this material is engineered to match the emission spectrum of both CLYC and CeBr3.

Adaptive Feedfoward Feedback Control Framework, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	A novel approach is proposed for the suppression of the aircraft's structural vibration to increase the resilience of the flight control law in the presence of the aeroelastic/aeroservoelastic (AE/ASE) interactions. Currently aircrafts with non-adaptive control laws usually include roll-off or notch filters to avoid AE/ASE interactions. xxxxxxver, if changes in the aircraft configuration are significant, the frequencies of the flexible modes of the aircraft may be shifted and the notch filters could become totally ineffective. With the proposed approach, the flexible modes can be consistently estimated in real-time via system identification algorithm. The identified flexible modes information is sought to be injected to the adaptive control algorithm to update a set of pre-chosen basis functions, These are the key elements for the effectiveness of the proposed method. As a result, undesirable effects of elastic modes will be suppressed while the whole system stability being maintained. Two case/analysis scenarios will be considered. First, the feedforward filter topology will be mainly used to reduce any atmospheric induced structural vibration of the aircraft. xxxxxxond, the adaptive feedback control is triggered to suppress any AE/ASE interactions, and prevent any possible xxxxxxxxLimit Cycle Oscillation (LCO) of the actual flexible aircraft.	14061

In xxxxxx I, we performed electrical and heavy ion tests on 1200V Wolfspeed xxxxxx xxxxxx diodes to generate response data, and performed TCAD simulations to investigate diode sensitivity to design parameters and analyze electro-thermal mechanisms behind measured response. In xxxxxx, we will develop further insight into physical mechanisms in the diodes via development and application of advanced physics models. We will parametrically analyze design features to identify promising hardness solutions, which will then be fabricated and experimentally characterized. We will also perform heavy-ion testing of 1200V xxxxxx MOSFETs and apply simulations for insights into governing mechanisms (to be further developed in follow on work). Direct participation by Wolfspeed in xxxxxx and beyond will ensure space-qualified, xxxxxx power devices for xxxxxx applications.	14062
Robust Six-axis Force and Torque Transducer, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The use of automated robotic tooling is required in a number of space missions. It is possible to have better tool control if the robotic arm could report loads experienced by the tooling. ATI Industrial Automation proposes to develop and prove technologies to be used in a low weight, low outgassing multi-axis force and torque transducer that can be used at cryogenic temperatures. The transducer will require strain gage excitation electrical power and output strain gage level voltage signals. These signals can be digitized and then mathematically transformed into values that represent the transducer's loads as forces in the X, Y, and Z axes and torques about the X, Y, and Z axes. The primary goal of this phase I proposal is to develop, produce, and characterize a proof of concept simplified transducer that can survive the harsh environments expected to be encountered on a xxxxxx lander mission.The technical objectives are:1. A transducer element capable of surviving temperatures from -135°C to +125xxxxxx. The transducer element in objective 1 with temperature compensation to minimize span and offset drift from -80°C to +70xxxxxx. The transducer element in objective 2 constructed so that it will sense properly in an atmospheric vacuum of 1E-5 torr.4. The transducer element in objective 3 made of low-outgassing materials that are compatible with an interplanetary sample-collecting mission.5. The transducer element in objective 4 constructed so it can survive vibrations of a rocket launch.6. The transducer element in objective 5 instrumented with redundant sets of strain gages.Two transducers will be built and tested: one with foil strain gages and one with silicon strain gages.	14063

Constraint-Checking Editor for Procedure Tracking (ConCEPT), Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	Constructing, maintaining, and adapting operational procedures for manned space operations is a complex task, requiring the procedure author to satisfy constraints resulting from the system configuration, current state, and applicable flight rules. This xxxxxx xxxxxx project will establish the feasibility of the Constraint-Checking Editor for xxxxxxedure Tracking (xxxxxx), a constraint-checking system for procedures represented in the xxxxxxedure Representation xxxxxxuage (PRL) and authored in xxxxxx. Using automated translation and Constraint Satisfaction Problem generation technologies developed on previous projects, xxxxxx will assist users in identifying conflicts and inconsistencies in procedures as they are developed.  The user edits a procedure in xxxxxx, using procedure steps that have been annotated with information about resources and state changes.  Configuration information, current state, and flight rules are stored in and obtained from the xxxxxx Description, an existing component of xxxxxx.  As the procedure is being developed, xxxxxx automatically and continuously gathers appropriate constraints from the domain model and flight rules, translates them into a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) which is then submitted to a CSP solver, which alerts the user to any violated constraints.  xxxxxx I will define relevant scenarios of use, establish the applicability and feasibility of xxxxxx, and provide a proof-of-concept demonstration.	14065
Radiation Tolerant 802.16 Wireless Network, Phase II	2011-08-01	2018-07-19	Exploration of planetary surfaces will require a communication architecture that supports operational capabilities in which fixed and mobile assets on the planetary surface can communicate seamlessly and securely to coordinate planetary exploration as well as communicate back to Earth. Communication systems operating on planetary surfaces will also require innovative solutions for analyzing and characterizing the lunar propagation environment.  Communications capabilities will need to include bi-directional, multi-point links to provide on-demand, autonomous interconnection between base stations, mobile robotic rovers, mobile humans, and in-space relay stations.  Communications could consist of voice, video, data and control.  Current available system solutions do not fulfill this need with respect to range, mobility, bandwidth, size, weight, and power. xxxxxx understands these issues and believes that the solution lies in the development of wireless devices that employ the radiation tolerant semiconductors and software radios as an underlying architecture feature.	14066

Low Gravity Drug Stability Analyzer, Phase II	2017-08-01	2018-07-19	The goal of this proposed program through xxxxxx is to build a space-worthy xxxxxx that can determine the extent of drug degradation.  It will be able to monitor the drug active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and its degradation product concentrations as a function of time, as well as determine if a drug is suitable for use.  This will be accomplished by designing and building a rugged, small, low mass, low power, easy to use analyzer that can identify and quantify API and degradation products with little or no sample handling in 1 minute.  Feasibility was successfully demonstrated during xxxxxx I by measuring acetaminophen, azithromycin, epinephrine, lidocaine, and their degradation products in mixtures and during reaction with a 1-4% limit of detection.  The API's were also successfully measured in commercial products.  During the xxxxxx program a prototype xxxxxx, suitable for space deployment will be built and used to measure the degradants of all the xxxxxx medical kit drugs (>100) with an accuracy goal of 2% and a precision goal of 1% within 1 minute.  The xxxxxx will be transitioned from a xxxxxx 3 to a 7 (ground tested).	14069
In-situ Sensing for Multi-Functional Structures, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx has developed a method to directly embed conductive fibers and dielectric layers into a carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (xxxxxx) structure.  To date we've been using this method to embed wiring harnesses and heaters into structures.  The proposed innovation leverages our success with embedded wiring, to embed strain gages and thermocouples.  The resulting innovation yields xxxxxx structures with multiple functionalities:1) transmitting electrical power2) transmitting electrical signals3) heating4) sensing strain due to loading5) sensing residual strain due to manufacturing6) sensing crack propagation7) sensing temperatureThe innovation is enabled by a novel combination of materials within a shared manufacturing process.  The material combination makes use of common carbon fibers that are conductive and demonstrate peizoresitive properties.  By layering and arranging these materials in a novel manner, the functionalities listed above can be realized.  Given that these sensing materials are in-situ (i.e. the materials are all fiber based and share a common matrix material) structural integrity is not compromised and the sensors are more likely to survive a lifetime of cyclic loading.  Additionally, because the sensory materials and conductors are all fiber-based, automated manufacturing techniques (e.g. automated fiber placement) can be utilized to reduce manufacturing costs.The embedded technologies, in combination with xxxxxx's self- aware aircraft tools, promise to reduce weight, increase performance, and life expectancy of aircraft.	14070

Spacecraft Rendezvous Guidance in Cluttered Dynamical Environments via Extreme Learning Machines, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxpAnalytX, xxxxxx. proposes to investigate a new approach to perform real-time, closed-loop optimal and robust rendezvous guidance in space environments comprising a potentially large number of spacecraft. More specifically, we propose to research and develop an advanced guidance system that is able to learn and track a fuel-efficient, collision-avoidance velocity vector field thus enabling safe, robust and effective relative motion guidance for autonomous rendezvous in space dynamical environments cluttered with cooperative and non-cooperative resident space objects. The guidance approach implements the next generation of Artificial Potential Functions xxxxxx (APFG) using an innovative combination of optimal control methods and Extreme Learning xxxxxxs (ELMs). xxxxxx I of this proposal seeks to develop and demonstrate software for autonomous rendezvous guidance using a combination of optimal control theory and new machine learning approaches. The key critical innovation is to use ELM algorithms that enable a dramatic training speed-up of many order of magnitude. xxxxxx I development will directly support xxxxxx mission needs for autonomous guidance algorithms in relative motion that execute in real-time autonomous collision avoidance in a fuel efficient fashion with the goal of reducing operational risks (i.e.. increase safety) and operational costs.	14072
OPTIMAL PARTITIONS OF DATA IN HIGHER DIMENSIONS	2010-10-13	2018-07-19	OPTIMAL PARTITIONS OF DATA IN xxxxxx DIMENSIONSBRADLEY W. JACKSON*, JEFFREY D. SCARGLE**, AND CHRIS CxxxxxxNZA, DAVID BARNES, DENNISKANYGIN, RUSSELL xxxxxxMIENTO, SOWMYA SUBxxxxxxNIAM, TZU-WANG CHUANG***Abstract. Consider piece-wise constant approximations to a function of several parameters, andthe problem of finding the best such approximation from measurements at a set of points in theparameter space. We find good approximate solutions to this problem in two steps: (1) partitionthe parameter space into cells, one for each of the N data points, and (2) collect these cells intoblocks, such that within each block the function is constant to within measurement uncertainty.We describe a branch-and-bound algorithm for finding the optimal partition into connected blocks,as well as an O(N2) dynamic programming algorithm that finds the exact global optimum over thisexponentially large search space, in a data space of any dimension. This second solution relaxesthe connectivity constraint, and requires additivity and convexity conditions on the block fitnessfunction, but in practice none of these items cause problems. From the wide variety of intelligentdata understanding applications (including cluster analysis, classification, and anomaly detection)we demonstrate two: partitioning of xxxxxx (2D) and the xxxxxx (3D).	14073
The World is Not Enough (WINE): Harvesting Local Resources for Eternal Exploration of Space, Phase I	2016-06-01	2018-07-19	The paradigm of exploration is changing. Smaller, smarter, and more efficient systems are being developed that could do as well as large, expensive, and heavy systems in the past. The 'science' fiction becomes reality fueled by advances in computing, materials, and nano-technology. These new technologies found their way into xxxxxx &#150; a booming business in the 21st century. xxxxxx are no longer restricted to aerospace companies. xxxxxxersities and even High Schools can develop them. The World is Not Enough (WINE) is a new generation of xxxxxx that take advantage of ISRU to explore space for ever. The WINE takes advantage of existing CubeSat technology and combines it with 3D printing technology and a water extraction system developed under xxxxxx xxxxxx, called MIxxxxxx . 3D printing enables development of cold gas thrusters as well as tanks that fit perfectly within the available space within the CubeSat. The MIxxxxxx allows capture and extraction of water, and takes advantage of the heat generated by the CubeSat electronics system. The water is stored in a cold gas thruster's tank and used for propulsion. Thus, the system can use the water that it has just extracted for prospecting to refuel and fly to another location. This replenishing of propellants extends the mission by doing ISRU (living off the land) even during the prospecting phase.In xxxxxx, we plan to test and investigate critical technologies such as (1) sample acquisition, (2) volatiles capture, and (3) 3D-printed cold gas thrusters that use water vapor including the organic and particulate contaminants that are inevitable during the early stages of asteroid mining. The engine is similar to a xxxxxxar Thermal Engine but scaled for a CubeSat. In xxxxxx 2, we propose to develop a testbed of the critical systems and to demonstrate these onboard xxxxxx (xxxxxx).	14074

Carbon Monoxide Silicate Reduction System, Phase II	2007-04-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx Silicate Reduction xxxxxx (COSRS) is a novel technology for producing large quantities of oxygen on the xxxxxx. xxxxxx yields of 15 kilograms per 100 kilograms of feed soil were demonstrated during xxxxxx I using both lunar and xxxxxx soil simulants. This is about five times the oxygen yield achievable by hydrogen reduction. Up to 30 kilograms of oxygen per 100 kilograms of feed soil are recoverable by adjustment of the carbon-silicon ratio.xxxxxx are sequentially subjected to iron oxide reduction by carbon monoxide, in-situ deposition of carbon throughout the soil by carbon monoxide disproportionation, and finally high-temperature carbothermal reduction of silicates by the deposited carbon.COSRS operates in a closed system. An inventory of carbon is maintained in the form of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and solid carbon. Most of the oxygen recovered from soil is in the form of carbon monoxide, which is converted to carbon dioxide. xxxxxx dioxide is then reacted with hydrogen in a reverse water gas shift reactor. The RWGS system regenerates carbon monoxide for use in the COSRS process and produces water, which is electrolyzed. xxxxxx from electrolysis is recycled within the RWGS system. xxxxxx from electrolysis is the COSRS product.	14077
Design Support and Analysis Tool for Pyrotechnically Actuated Valves, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	"Pyrotechnically actuated valves are triggered on or off by firing an explosive charge that rapidly releases large amounts of high-pressure, gas.  Pyrovalves are generally used for critical safety functions in almost all liquid and solid rocket systems and are designed to be fail-proof and provide extremely reliable actuation.  xxxxxxver due to the lack of mature analysis tools, current design practices and safety analysis are heavily based on empiricism and are testing driven.  The innovation proposed here is a comprehensive design and analysis tool that can characterize the transient performance of pyrotechnic actuators and provide a virtual test bed to assess performance and functional margin of these systems.  The objective under this effort would be to develop a comprehensive three-dimensional transient tool that would simulate the gas --dynamic interactions with combustion, and model thermal effects in the valve material.  For more complex initiator designs where multiple initiators may be fired, the tool could be used to identify \"skew\" effects resulting from the offset between the initiator firings.  Since pyrovalves are ubiquitous and necessary for any rocket system, the tools and technology developed here would be useful to a broad variety of programs of core interest to xxxxxx including the constellation program."	14078

Nano-Engineered Hierarchical Advanced Composite Materials for Space Applications	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	Composites are widely used throughout aerospace engineering and in numerous other applications where structures that possess high strength and toughness properties with the minimum possible weight are required. Aligned advanced fibers (such as glass or carbon fibers) embedded in a matrix (such as epoxy or carbon) are laid or woven at specific angle sequences and bonded together, enabling installation of non-isotropic bulk properties into the resulting laminate while simultaneously taking advantage of the high in-plane stiffness characteristic of advanced fibers. By replacing metal components in aircraft, composites can reduce the structural weight of the aircraft and therefore reduce fuel consumption and increase payload capacity. The interlaminar region perpendicular to the planar direction of the fibers, however, is relatively weak, leading to undesirable performance with regard to both strength and toughness. While z-pinning and other micron-scale reinforcement methods can introduce fiber damage, resin pockets, and loss of in-plane properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can provide nano-scale reinforcement of the interlaminar region without disrupting alignment and volume fraction of fibers in the laminate, thereby preserving in-plane properties while simultaneously addressing through-thickness shortcomings. In my work, I grow aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on advanced fibers to make 'fuzzy fibers', where the extremely stiff and strong CNTs extend between plies and fibers to provide mechanical reinforcement. Preliminary tests of my samples show significant increases in static interlaminar strength and toughness. In this project, I will study whether the demonstrated improvements in interlaminar properties translate into improved impact toughness. xxxxxxistic impact toughness is critical on components such as aircraft engine fan cases for blade containment and the outer surface of air and spacecraft for protection against bird strike, foreign object, and micrometeorite damage. xxxxxx has been at the forefront of developing composite fan cases to trap loose fan blades while maintaining mechanical integrity. The use of 'fuzzy fibers' will be studied for impact reinforcement of fan cases as well as other dynamic load applications like vibration damping.In collaboration with xxxxxx colleagues, appropriate impact specimens will be designed and manufactured to isolate impact energy ranges and failure modes that represent expected events such as jet engine blade containment or ballistic meteorite damage, and will be tested at xxxxxx's xxxxxxistic Impact xxxxxx. By improving the impact toughness and damage tolerance of the current state of the art composite fan case, the engine weight can be further reduced and the technology can be used to toughen other composite aircraft components such as engine blades and possibly provide vibration damping. As CNTs have been previously shown to add multifunctionality to composites through enhanced electrical and thermal conductivity, recommendations for addressing thermal load management and structural health monitoring in spacecraft applications will be made. Demonstrated improvements in this advanced fiber-thermoset system will invite extension to thermoplastic matrices, which can be melted and reformed, thereby enabling alternative repair methods such as local heating to heal damage.	14082
Analysis of dust samples from the Russian part of the ISS	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	Our study focuses on the hardiest microorganisms inhabiting the xxxxxx in order to assess their diversity and capabilities to resist certain stresses.

In this study we analyzed these microorganisms with respect to their resistance towards thermal stress and exposure to clinically relevant antibiotics. In addition we assessed the bacterial and archaeal community via molecular methods (NGS sequencing) and compared our new data with the previously derived information from the xxxxxx microbiome.	14083
A Mathematical Model to Assess CMAS Damage in EBCs, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	As the power density of advanced engines increases, the need for new materials that are capable of higher operating temperatures, such as ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), is critical for turbine hot-section static and rotating components. Such advanced materials have demonstrated the promise to significantly increase the engine temperature capability relative to conventional super alloy metallic blades. They also show the potential to enable longer life, reduced emissions, growth margin, reduced weight and increased performance relative to super alloy blade materials. Environmental Barrier Coatings (EBCs) are required for xxxxxx-based composites used in hot-section components of aircraft turbine engines to limit degradation from reaction of the composite with combustion gases. EBCs themselves are subject to degradation when debris composed of calcium-magnesium alumino-silicates (CMAS) is ingested into the engine melts in the turbine hot-section, and deposits on the coated components. The CMAS reacts with the coating and degrades the mechanical properties of the coating during temperature cycling which occurs during normal engine operation. xxxxxx linking the thermochemical and thermomechanical degradation of the EBCs due to CMAS are needed to understand life of the coatings and to identify best strategies for developing improved coating systems. MR&D is proposing a combined analytical and experimental program to develop a mathematical model for CMC EBCs exposed to CMAS.	14084
Development and Testing of a Green Monopropellant Ignition System	2017-08-01	2018-07-19	The proposed experiment will demonstrate the potential of a novel micro-hybrid gas generator to thermally dissociate aqueous solutions of hydroxylamine nitrate (HAN). This ammonium salt lies within a class of ionic liquids (ILs) that have recently been investigated as alternative green replacements for hydrazine as a spacecraft propellant. The proposed research is directly aligned with two key elements of xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx. 1) xxxxxx TA01.1.4.2, Launch Vehicle Propulsion Technologies, xxxxxx Propulsion xxxxxxs: xxxxxx and mature ignition concepts that require low part count and/or low energy to be used as either primary or redundant ignition sources, and 2) xxxxxx TA02.1.1.1, In-xxxxxx Propulsion Technologies, xxxxxx: Evaluate alternate green propellants that allow thrusters to operate in pulse and continuous modes with these new propellants. Qualify propellants and components (valves, filters, regulators etc.) for spaceflight.While the primary purpose of this research is to support in-space propulsion, the technology could also be adapted for use as a main booster ignition system and as a reaction control thruster. A primary research objective is to demonstrate repeatable, consistent ignition of ionic-liquid-based propellants. With the current state of the art, propellants based on IL-solutions are notoriously difficult to ignite, and a cold-start capability does not exist. Existing catalyst beds used to dissociate the IL component of the solution must be pre-heated to greater than 350 C before firing. This shortcoming is especially disadvantageous for small satellite propulsion systems where energy conservation and volumetric efficiency are primary considerations.	14085

High-fidelity computational modules for fluid dynamics, heat transfer, structural dynamics, and dynamic motion will be coupled into a multidisciplinary computing environment. The multi-disciplinary system has been successfully applied for aeroelastic and dynamic simulations of fighter aircraft, hypersonic vehicles and planetary probes. The application range will be extended to the rarefied regime through integration of an existing xxxxxx xxxxxx flow solver.In xxxxxx I, continuum flow regime sample analyses will be performed for a trailing ballute configuration to demonstrate the capabilities of the software environment.

Agent-Based Health Monitoring System, Phase II	2006-11-01	2018-07-19	We propose combination of software intelligent agents to achieve decentralized reasoning, with fault detection and diagnosis using PCA, neural nets, and maximum entropy methods.  The goal of the work is to achieve integrated system health management and self-reliant systems, including integration with the maintenance and logistics scheduling systems to achieve fully automated end-to-end solutions. At low levels the agents will evaluate raw sensor signals to detect and diagnose the cause of anomalies.  At the next higher level, the agents will combine the diagnostic results from multiple lower level agents to detect and diagnose anomalies in the interaction between components or subsystems.  If there is a maintenance action or a spare part indicated by the prognosis, a Task Agent and/or a Spare Parts agent will be spawned to interact with the appropriate agent-based xxxxxx xxxxxx to insure that the requirements are met.  Agents at each level are also responsible for performing graceful degradation in the event of a failure at their level.  At the low level, we have demonstrated that the PCA algorithm can greatly reduce the amount of diagnostic data that must be shared between hierarchical levels.  We have also demonstrated other algorithms for anomaly detection, diagnosis, and diagnostic data-fusion.	14090

Optical Approach to Augment Current Float Sensing Method of Determining Cryogen Fluid Height Within a Tank, Phase I	2012-02-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxovative Imaging and xxxxxxearch, a small technology development company,has teamed with the xxxxxxersity of Southern xxxxxx xxxxxxent andxxxxxxgenics xxxxxxoratory to integrate existing xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxCenter heritage cryogen level monitoring technology with noncontactoptical methods and advanced signal processing to create a 21st centuryliquid cryogen level measurement technique.  We propose to place afiber-optic laser range finder on the upper surface of a low pressurecryogen run tank and use the existing xxxxxx effect float system as anoptical target to reflect the light signal back to the range finder.  Wealso propose combining measurements obtained with the fiber-optic rangefinder with those taken by the heritage system using a custom xxxxxx signal processing algorithm to reduce measurement noise andincrease overall accuracy.  Our optical technique has several advantagesover the existing xxxxxx effect method.  It yields near continuousmeasurements and is not dependent on the location of individual sensors.It is based on an alternate physics approach and therefore yieldscompletely independent results.  The optical range finder instrumentcalibration is performed outside the tank, so test operation is notsignificantly impacted and run tanks do not need to be emptied.  Inaddition, an optical fiber mounted on the upper surface of a cryogentank does not present foreign object debris (FOD) concerns.  During ourxxxxxx STTR project we will demonstrate our concept in a universitycryogen research laboratory using a commercial optical range finder.

Current radiobiology experimentation at the NSRL is limited primarily by the amount of time required to manually move samples to/from the radiation target area.  Additionally, the NSRL facility currently does not support processing of samples during or directly after radiation exposure, or long duration radiobiology studies.  Our proposed automated system will address the above issues as follows.  First, an automated sample movement system will be developed to reduce the overhead time of the current manual system of moving samples to/from the radiation target area.  xxxxxxond, an xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx will be designed to provide immediate sample analysis, such as sample fixation and freezing, to allow a better understanding of the radiation effects on the samples.

If the sorbent regeneration can be carried out during the extravehicular activity (EVA) with a relatively high regeneration frequency, the size of the sorbent canister and weight can be significantly reduced.  TDA xxxxxxearch, xxxxxx. (TDA) proposes to develop a compact, regenerable sorbent-based system to control xxxxxx and humidity in the space suit ventilation loop.  The sorbent can be regenerated using space vacuum during the EVA, eliminating all duration-limiting elements in the life support system.	14097

Woven Thermal Protection System (WTPS)	2013-09-01	2018-07-19	Woven Thermal Protection xxxxxx (TPS) is a 14-month technology development project to prove the feasibility of woven material as a game changing approach for future planetary entry/return missions.   xxxxxx entry and near-Earth object return missions with an anticipated heat flux between 1,500 and 10,000 W/cm2 are currently limited to one viable TPS material - fully dense carbon phenolic (CP). xxxxxxver, high-density CP is only mass efficient at heat fluxes above 4000 W/cm2. This mid-density TPS performance gap can be filled using cost-effective weaving technology to produce high-grade, conformal, mid- to high-density TPS. Woven TPS not only bridges this gap but also offers a superior performing replacement for heritage CP.   A woven TPS approach can result in TPS solutions that are optimized to a given mission's environments but with much-reduced costs compared to current TPS development and certification approaches. The woven TPS approach utilizes a stable xxxxxx weaving industrial base and processes that has a proven legacy and longevity in manufacturing commercial and advanced aerospace products. This industry has demonstrated capability to weave highly complex patterns in a 3D weave configuration for commercial applications.   The Woven TPS Project will demonstrate this concept in partnership with a reliable industrial weaver selected through a Request for Information process in a 14-month program. We will accomplish this by designing and manufacturing a series of low-, mid- and high-density samples of woven carbon fiber material of varying yarn compositions, weave architectures, and level of resin infiltration and by testing them at extreme conditions. It is the project's goal to develop a preliminary database, compare the performance of woven TPS against heritage fully dense CP, and raise the woven TPS from xxxxxx Readiness xxxxxx (xxxxxx) 2 at the start of the project to xxxxxx 3 at project completion.	14100
Oxygen Containment System Options for Nuclear Thermal Propulsion Testing	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	All nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) ground testing conducted in the 1950s and 1960s during the ROVER/(Nuclear Engine xxxxxx Vehicle xxxxxxlication (NERVA) program discharged engine exhaust directly into the open air.&nbsp; xxxxxxver, due to current US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) radiation protection guidelines and health regulations from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), this practice is no longer acceptable.&nbsp; With NTP engine exhaust, hot gaseous hydrogen is nominally expected to be free of radioactive byproducts from the nuclear reactor; however, it does have the potential to be contaminated due to off-nominal engine reactor performance. One NTP ground testing option that has been documented by the ARES Corporation on Nuclear Thermal Propulsion xxxxxx Test Facility (2006), which has been recommended as one of three acceptable ground test facility options, is to fully contain the engine exhaust. The concept in this particular ground test design is accomplished by injecting hydrogen exhaust with a high mixture ratio of oxygen that reacts with the hydrogen to produce steam. xxxxxx and any trace amounts of radioactive noble gases released by off-nominal NTP engine reactor performance would then be captured, contained, and either held until the radiation has decayed to an environmentally safe/acceptable level (below background exposure)&nbsp; for release and/or treatment. &nbsp;The design concept goals in this project are to explore methods to minimize the overall volume of the containment system, more completely define the system requirements and designs, and then perform a systems trade study to validate feasibility, safety and cost.&nbsp; The concept for this project is to take the hydrogen exhaust and inject it with a high mixture ratio of oxygen so the reaction produces steam.&nbsp; In theory, in a radioactive state, any trace amounts of radioactive noble gases released by off-nominal NTP engine reactor performance would be contained in the steam.&nbsp;&nbsp; Water is injected to condense the potentially contaminated steam into water. This water and the Gaseous xxxxxx (GO2) would then be captured in a containment area where the water and GO2 would be divided into separate containment tanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the project will also look at mechanisms that may minimize the storage requirements, thereby, reducing hazard risk of these respective systems by using two methods for GO2 retention: (1) &nbsp;compressed gas storage system and (2) liquid storage.&nbsp; The compressed gas option would pump residual GO2 from the containment area at near ambient pressure to a 1000 psi xxxxxximum Allowable xxxxxx Pressure (MAWP) storage vessel.&nbsp; The liquid storage option flows GO2 from the containment area through a liquid nitrogen (LN2) heat exchanger to liquefy the GO2 and store the liquefied oxygen (LO2) in a vacuum/LN2 jacketed tank for storage, decay, and subsequent disposal.	14101
Effects of spaceflight on murine skeletal muscle gene expression	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	xxxxxxflight results in a number of adaptations to skeletal muscle including atrophy and shifts towards faster muscle fiber types. To identify changes in gene expression that may underlie these adaptations microarray expression analysis was performed on gastrocnemius from mice flown on the xxxxxx shuttle flight (11 days 19 hours) versus mice maintained on earth for the same period. Additionally to identify changes that were due to unloading and reloading microarray analyses were conducted on calf muscle from ground-based mice subjected to hindlimb suspension (12 days) and mice subjected to hindlimb suspension plus a brief period of reloading (3.5 hours) to simulate the time between landing and sacrifice of the spaceflight mice.	14102

NASA Earth Science Communications: Airplane to TDRSS	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	"The main objective of this proposal is to perform a feasibility study for the use of xxxxxx Tracking and xxxxxx Relay xxxxxx xxxxxx (TDRSS) as the provider of communication services for xxxxxx aircrafts. The feasibility study will lead us to the end goal of defining an airplane communication system architecture through TDRSxxxxxx driver of this effort is to reduce costs of airborne missions and improve communication's reliability. The xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Program is an important part of xxxxxxs Division within the xxxxxx Mission Directorate that provides \"aircraft systems that further science and advance the use of satellite data\"1. It includes aircraft, e.g. the Wallops P3, and xxxxxx ER-2 and xxxxxx Hawk, with instruments that continue to advance the science achieved from these platforms, used by investigators from xxxxxx, other government agencies and universities.  xxxxxx (GSFC) has a successful history of airborne scientific instruments, for example the ER-2 xxxxxx (EDOP), xxxxxx xxxxxx (CRS), the xxxxxx xxxxxx (CPL), Conical xxxxxx xxxxxx-wave Imaging xxxxxx (xxxxxx), and others that have provided advances in cloud and precipitation remote sensing. The aircraft program also provides an avenue to test and fly instruments that can later be extended for observations from space. It is then logical to assume that as science advances, and higher data rates are desired for observations from space, this translates into the need for higher data rate communications from aircraft. The xxxxxx aircraft platforms vary in the altitudes they can achieve, hence different communication needs are likely to exist. This study will look into trades including: available TDRSS services, required coverage, required data rates, communication links, communication frequency comparison (S vs. Ku vs. xxxxxxs), and spectrum requirements. The end goal is to make a recommendation for the on-board communications system architecture to communicate airborne science data through TDRSS. This architecture would include recommendations on information data frames and packet formats to meet the existing infrastructure, modulation selection, number of instruments that can communicate through this architecture, and comm. subsystem hardware, including the antenna needed to meet the required links for tracking TDRSS. As part of this study, we would evaluate if one solution could exist that would be feasible for all xxxxxx aircraft platforms. In addition, we would investigate the use of TDRSS in the Long Duration xxxxxxoon Program, which currently uses S-band TDRSS Services, and developments done for communications of sounding rockets. In the future, the process and savings outlined by achieving a xxxxxx TDRSS Service for other platforms could be presented to the xxxxxx Hawk Operation offices for primary or secondary (backup) communications."	14106
Plasma Sensor for High Bandwidth Mass-Flow Measurements at High Mach Numbers with RF Link, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	The proposal is aimed at the development of a miniature high bandwidth(1 MHz class) plasma sensor for flow measurements at high enthalpies.This device uses a plasma discharge between two encapsulated electrodesas the primary sensing element to measure various flow parametersincluding mass flow. The advantages of the plasma sensor are that itrequires no frequency compensation up to its xxxxxx carrier frequency, hasan amplitude-modulated output that has excellent common-mode rejectionwith a signal-to-noise ratio that is much better than a hot-wire, isrobust with no sensor element to break, can have a small spatial volume,and is insensitive to temperature variations making calibration easierthan thermal-based sensors. This sensor has applications formeasurements in gas-turbine machinery, shock tubes, shock-boundary layerexperiments, high-enthalpy hypersonic flows, and in plasma-laden flowssuch as on reentry vehicles. The output from the sensor is wirelesslytransmitted and can be remotely demodulated and converted into theconstituent mean and fluctuating components. The proposed effort isdesigned to advance and expand the capabilities of the plasma sensor forhigh xxxxxx number flows.	14107

Properties of these topology controlalgorithms include: (a) Preserving the connectivity of the underlyingstate-dependent sensing graph during reconfiguration and re-targeting ofthe formation; (b) Achieving a balanced interplay between performanceand robustness to communication delays; and (c) Using only localinformation to make local decisions that collectively guarantee theglobal properties such as the network connectivity. xxxxxx I effort willdeliver a preliminary software analysis tool to help the xxxxxx xxxxxxI teamevaluate these trade-offs for candidate xxxxxxI architectures.

AlInGaN-Based Superlattice Terahertz Source, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	WaveBand Corporation in collaboration with xxxxxx Commonwealth xxxxxxersity proposes to design and fabricate a new sub-millimeter source based on an InAlxxxxxx superlattice (SL).  Semiconductor SLs have proven their ability to deliver high-frequency current oscillations caused by specific electron dynamics in a narrow miniband.  For this project, WaveBand proposes to demonstrate SLs based on one of the xxxxxx-family materials that deliver high temperature and high power operation superior to those provided by conventional xxxxxx-V materials based on xxxxxx and InAs alloys.  The idea of xxxxxx oscillators has been around for a while, yet actual example has not been demonstrated.  The reason is that dc-current instability prevents oscillations at high frequency.  The innovation of the proposed work is that we plan to use short-period SLs with complex miniband electron energy dispersion that suppresses the dc-instability and allows electrons to oscillate at multiples of the fundamental xxxxxx frequency.  MBE-growth of short-period SLs will be performed using formation of spontaneous superlattices from an immiscible composition.	14111
Implementation and Assessment of a Time-Accurate Aeroelastic Model for Analysis of Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerators	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	In light of xxxxxx goal for planetary exploration, the development of new technology is imperative. The aerodynamic deceleration technique used during xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and xxxxxxding (EDL) plays a vital role in mission success. The concept of interest in the current research is the inflatable aerodynamic decelerator (IAD). An inflatable aerodynamic decelerator is a gas-pressurized device that is inflated at the time of deployment. This technology was born in the 1960's, followed by minimal research until the mid 1990's. Over the past 15 years there have been many studies that have continued to show feasibility and the necessity of this type of technology. Necessity stems from the fact that the current entry technology is quickly reaching its limits in terms of landing high payload masses on xxxxxx.It is well known that the complex flowfields during atmospheric entry will strongly interact with the structural dynamics of an IAD. This, in conjunction with the inherent unsteadiness of the flow, leads to many challenges in understanding these interactions. Thus, this research proposes to develop a time-accurate aeroelastic model with application to the analysis of inflatable aerodynamic decelerators. This will be accomplished through the coupling of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver and a computational structural dynamics (CSD) solver. The CFD and CSD solvers ultimately used in this work will be selected through close consultation with research partners at xxxxxx. One approach under consideration for the CFD analysis is the use of NASCART-GT, a solution adaptive, Cartesian, xxxxxx code developed at the xxxxxx Institute of xxxxxx. One of the key difficulties in performing aerodynamic analysis of deforming bodies is the fact that the computational mesh must change with time. Using NASCART-GT will provide an automated grid generation process to begin the computational solution. As the IAD is deformed, new surface information must be computed, and the flow solution may proceed. The computed pressure and thermal load distribution over the geometry are input to the structures solver. There are many solvers that exist, with the most likely candidate being LS-DYNA, based on the previous coupling efforts with NASCART-GT. This previous work demonstrated successful coupling to obtain steady-state aeroelastic solutions. The results to date have not included the effects of temperature and heat flux on the IAD. Using a recently enhanced tool in NASCART-GT, which combines an xxxxxx solution with an integral boundary layer method, will provide these thermal effects. The time-accurate, coupled analysis tool must first be validated against either wind tunnel tests or against other forms of reliable computational results. Following the development and validation of this computational tool, analysis on a series of configurations directly applicable to points along a trajectory of interest will be conducted. The specifics of this task will require collaboration with xxxxxx in order to determine appropriate conditions.The proposed research falls under multiple xxxxxx (TA) of xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx. The primary TA that categorizes the proposed work is TA 9: xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and xxxxxxding xxxxxxs. Within this category, there are several higher-level areas including the following: 9.1.4 Hypersonic Decelerators, 9.1.6 xxxxxx xxxxxx and Simulation, 9.2.1 Attached Deployable Decelerators, and 9.2.2 Trailing Deployable Decelerators. Further development of IADs will provide xxxxxx with a suitable means of attaining the goal of planetary space exploration. The current research furthers this endeavor by investigating the complex problems associated with the interaction between aerodynamics and structural dynamics. xxxxxxults from this work will be able to provide a greater understanding of this phenomenon, as well as the ability to computationally predict these effects.	14112
hMSCs Cultured on Plant-Derived Tissue Engineering Extracellular Matrix in a Microgravity Environment	2017-09-01	2018-07-19	The objective of this proposal is to fabricate an all plant-derived renewable, biodegradable complete mimic of the bone extracellular matrix (ECM). For the first time in space research technology, plant-derived materials will be used to fabricate fully plant-derived mimics of the ECM as constructs to study the underlying cellular mechanisms responsible for the alteration of bone cells as a result of microgravity during space missions.Net bone mass is dictated by the relative activities of bone cells, osteoclasts and osteoblasts, both of which have been found to be affected by microgravity environment. In order to understand the underlying cellular mechanisms, in vitro cell studies are conducted in simulated microgravity environments, but appropriate constructs are needed. By supplying the bone cells with a biomaterial that closely resembles their native ECM, the variables affecting cell behavior may be reduced to microgravity alone. xxxxxxt-derived materials have natural properties and molecular structures resembling the constituent fiber proteins and the glycosaminoglycans in the native ECM; thus, the use of these materials to completely mimic the bone ECM appears appropriate. Preliminary data revealed that the materials and methods utilized to fabricate the constructs provided a suitable environment for human mesenchymal stem cells lineage (bone cell precursors).By creating tissue engineering complete mimics of bone ECM for in vitro cell studies in simulated microgravity environment, a better understanding of the effects that microgravity has on bone can be achieved. This is a step closer toward potential treatment for microgravity-induced bone loss.	14113

Energy Based Acoustic Measurement Senors, Phase I	2006-01-01	2018-07-19	This research focuses on fully developing energy density sensors that will yield a significant benefit both for measurements of interest to xxxxxx, as well as for general acoustic measurements.

A Scalable Local Algorithm for Distributed Multivariate Regression	2010-09-22	2018-07-19	This paper offers a local distributed algorithm for multivariate regression in large peer-to-peer environments. The algorithm can be used for distributed inferencing, data compaction, data modeling and classification tasks in many emerging peer-to-peer applications for bioinformatics, astronomy, social networking, sensor networks and web mining. Computing a global regression model from data available at the different peer-nodes using a traditional centralized algorithm for regression can be very costly and impractical because of the large number of data sources, the asynchronous nature of the peer-to-peer networks, and dynamic nature of the data/network. This paper proposes a two-step approach to deal with this problem. First, it offers an efficient local distributed algorithm that monitors the quality  of the current regression model. If the model is outdated, it uses this algorithm as a feedback mechanism for rebuilding the model. The local nature of the monitoring algorithm guarantees low monitoring cost. Experimental results presented in this paper strongly support the theoretical claims.	14118

Amazon Web Services: MOD13Q1	2015-06-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxx vegetation indices are designed to provide consistent spatial and temporal comparisons of vegetation conditions. Blue, red, and near-infrared reflectances, centered at 469-nanometers, 645-nanometers, and 858-nanometers, respectively, are used to determine the xxxxxx daily vegetation indices. The xxxxxx xxxxxx (NDVI) complements NOAA's xxxxxxanced Very High xxxxxxolution xxxxxx (AVHRR) NDVI products and provides continuity for time series historical applications. xxxxxx also includes a new Enhanced xxxxxx (EVI) that minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI also uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The xxxxxx NDVI and EVI products are computed from atmospherically corrected bi-directional surface reflectances that have been masked for water, clouds, heavy aerosols, and cloud shadows. xxxxxx xxxxxx data are provided every 16 days at 250-meter spatial resolution as a gridded level-3 product in the xxxxxx projection. xxxxxxing a 250m blue band, the EVI algorithm uses the 500m blue band to correct for residual atmospheric effects, with negligible spatial artifacts. Vegetation indices are used for global monitoring of vegetation conditions and are used in products displaying land cover and land cover changes. These data may be used as input for modeling global biogeochemical and hydrologic processes and global and regional climate. These data also may be used for characterizing land surface biophysical properties and processes, including primary production and land cover conversion.	14120
1mN Electrospray Thruster with Safe Passive Propellant Delivery, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx proposes to develop a compact electrospray propulsion system with unprecedented capability. The 1500s xxxxxx while requiring less than 45W of power. Compared with existing state-of-the-art CubeSat thrusters, the system will provide more thrust than available gridded ion engines at lower power and without greatly penalizing xxxxxx. xxxxxx will develop the thruster through new innovations merged with existing, flight-qualified electrospray thruster heritage. The extremely low flow rates of high xxxxxx electrospray thrusters permits passive feeding, where pressure vessels, regulators and their associated electronics are eliminated in favor of a natural flow regulation; freeing up valuable volume budget for additional propellant or payload. xxxxxxver, passive electrospray thrusters in general suffer from flow control ambiguities, leading to irrecoverable failures due to the conductive propellant degrading or shorting electrical isolators. xxxxxx will integrate new innovations that overcome these issues into a systematic development methodology, leading to the most robust passively-fed electrospray thruster to date. The system will be capable of more 0.7kg of propellant throughput (xxxxxx0m/s deltaV for a 6U CubeSat) and be fully scalable to higher capacity.In xxxxxx I xxxxxx will develop a thruster head that provides >300microN of thrust and includes a never-saturated porous reservoir. The restorative capillary force of this reservoir will prevent liquid seepage and maintain consistent performance. An annular geometry will circumvent propellant and surface degradation due to edge effects. In parallel, a method for transferring IL from high open volume storage tanks to the intermediate porous reservoir will be demonstrated. Finally, the complete 1.2mN thruster, comprising an array of 4 thruster heads will be designed. xxxxxx, will validate this system and culminate with delivering an engineering model	14121
Integrated Three-Port Converters for Compact and Efficient Power Management, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	To meet the ever-increasing power demand of today's spacecraft systems, an integrated power electronics system capable of interfacing, and simultaneously controlling, three power ports will be designed and demonstrated in xxxxxx I of the proposed project. This new proposed power electronic architecture employs a single-stage power topology, thus allowing cost-effective control of power flow with improved efficiency, power density, and reliability. This is achieved by modifying the switching patterns and control strategy of suitable conventional isolated converters, fully utilizing digital power electronics control methods. The result is multi-function utilization of converter components for increased capabilities with minimal effects on losses, size, weight and cost for such components. Moreover, existing engineering design concepts can be easily used to optimize the new proposed power topologies in a fashion similar to the conventional mother topologies including soft-switching techniques, component selection, and magnetic design procedures at higher switching frequencies. Each of these topologies is capable of performing simultaneous control of two of its three ports from battery or ultra-capacitor charge regulation, solar array peak power tracking, and/or load voltage regulation. Such converters are valuable alternative for designers of power systems requiring multiple power sources, or interfaced to power storage devices.	14122

Nanoporous Cyclic Brush Polymers for Selective Carbon Dioxide Capture	2019-08-01	2018-07-19	The objective of the proposed work is to develop advanced synthetic methodologies that afford nanoporous materials with selective uptake affinity towards carbon dioxide and large gas storage capacities. The expected significance of this work is the increase in porosity and uptake capacity in azo-linked porous organic polymers (ALP) for carbon dioxide capture as well as increased thermal stability of these materials by the incorporation of a cyclic backbone. Cyclic polymers show remarkably different behaviors than their linear counterparts, and are expected to provide a highly tunable system for removing impurities such as carbon dioxide from breathing air aboard space vessels. The tunability will be further enhanced by the construction of ALP-based molecular brush polymers, which behave significantly differently from linear polymer analogs, and will allow for pre-established molecular design parameterization facilitated by the covalent connectivity combined with solution- and solid-state assembly processes. Cyclic brush polymers will be achieved by ring-expansion metathesis polymerization (REMP), and a significant effort will be directed towards modifications of the catalyst and reaction conditions to improve control of this polymerization. xxxxxx dense networks of azo-linkages, recently shown to be efficacious for selective carbon dioxide uptake, will be achieved by grafting from techniques. A library of cyclic brushes with varying backbone length, azo-linkage compositional fraction, and azo-linkage branch points will be prepared and tested to experimentally obtain carbon dioxide uptake capacity and selectivity.The preparation and subsequent testing of these materials will involve a wide array of synthetic and characterization techniques. For polymers soluble in organic solvents, solution-state NMR spectroscopy will be used to obtain their compositions and number-average molecular weight values; size exclusion chromatography (SEC) will be used to obtain their molecular weights and molecular weight distributions. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis will probe the glass and melting transition temperatures and the thermal stability, respectively. xxxxxx force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) will be used to image the surface characteristics of these materials. The porosity, carbon dioxide uptake capacity, and carbon dioxide selectivity will be determined experimentally with physisorption analysis.It is expected that the proposed work will afford a simple, scalable synthesis of a cyclic brush polymer system with highly tunable porosity and surface morphology that can be utilized for selective capture of carbon dioxide. The proposed project is also expected to yield a better fundamental understanding of the physicochemical behaviors and functionalization potential of these systems with regard to their applications in space technology as lightweight, nanoporous materials.	14125
Modular, Fault-Tolerant Electronics Supporting Space Exploration, Phase II	2008-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx electronic systems tolerate only as many point failures as there are redundant system copies, using mere macro-scale redundancy.  xxxxxx Tolerant xxxxxxnics Supporting xxxxxx Exploration (FTESSE) creates an electronic design paradigm using reprogrammable FPGAs to create swappable Circuit Object Blocks (COBs) -- analogous to software objects -- for the first time enabling redundancy on a micro-scale. The result is an increased tolerance of point failures by several orders of magnitude over traditional approaches. In the FTESSE approach, FPGAs are partitioned into COBs (groups of gates), each performing a specific function. Bad areas can be mapped like the bad sector data on a disk drive, enabling COBs to be placed in areas of working gates to recover system performance. xxxxxx tested during xxxxxx I verified point failures could be introduced into an example circuit and corrected. As in the xxxxxx I model, circuits to be monitored reside on a Slave FPGA, and a Master FPGA monitors outputs of all COBs, sensing faults and mapping non-working gates on xxxxxx. The Master is a rad-hard, triple mode redundancy (TMR) FPGA, but the xxxxxx need not be, opening the doors to higher performance applications while maintaining high levels of fault tolerance.	14126
THE DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION OF AN INTEGRATED ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE SCHEDULER, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	"Intelligent Automation, xxxxxx. (IAI) proposes the design and validation of a dynamic integrated arrival/departure  scheduler. In contrast to current approaches, we propose changing arrival and departure runway assignments dynamically based upon the traffic situation, weather conditions, surface congestion, and planned departure pushbacks as well as planned arrivals flowing into the terminal area from the enroute centers. xxxxxx of the concept will be done in a virtual software environment, first using an analytic environment and later with humans-in-the-loop (controllers and pilots). When complete, this project has the potential to provide (1) a strategy to handle the FAA's Best-Equipped Best-Served concept at airports, (2) a significant increase in xxxxxx capacity without building additional runways and (3) support for a new aviation business model in which flights are scheduled to xxxxxxes rather than specific airports.  To accomplish these goals, this effort will develop a controller that dynamically assigns arrival and departure slots available at a given runway based on the valuation of an \"integrated capacity utilization metric.\" The metric will be a function of arrival/departure demand, arrival queue lengths at fixes and surface departure queues. The result is a more efficient use of airport resources than provided by currently available controllers."	14127
Advanced Capabilities Medical Suction Device, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	A compact microgravity and hypogravity compatible vacuum device is proposed to provide medical suction and containment of extracted fluids.  The proposed aspirator will draw up to 40 L/min of air and produce a nominal vacuum of 500-mm Hg, which is comparable to commercially available medical aspirators.  The unit will also provide a means for separation and containment of up to 1000 mL of aspirated fluids.  xxxxxx material separation will be accomplished by a reticulated foam trap that will utilize hydrophilic adsorbent materials to sequester liquids within the reticulated foam structure.  The aspirator assembly will also include a sub-micron filter to prevent aerosol from escaping to the spacecraft cabin.  During the xxxxxx I research, an efficient trap will be designed and tested using a commercial off the shelf (COTS) vacuum pump.  Additional trap features will be investigated including collapsible walls to minimize storage space and chemical resistance to enable suction of corrosive and/or toxic materials.  xxxxxx research will focus on improving overall ESM and incorporating features such as a trap fill level indicator, an emergency shutoff in case of liquid breakthrough, and an alarm indicating a blocked airway, which will improve microgravity performance.	14128
Microphone Array Signal Processing and Active Noise Control for the In-Helmet Speech Communication, Phase II	2011-12-01	2018-07-19	For in-helmet voice communication, the currently used Communication-xxxxxx-based Audio (CCA) systems have a number of recognized logistical issues and inconveniences that cannot be resolved with incremental improvements to the basic design of the CCA systems. The objective of this research project is to develop an xxxxxxted xxxxxxsuit Audio (ISA) system that can possess similar performance to a CCA while offering users inherent comfort and ease of use. In xxxxxx I, the feasibility of using microphone array beamforming or multichannel noise reduction plus a single-channel postfilter to combat a variety of types of in-helmet noise was validated. Comparative simulations indicated that novel multichannel noise reduction is more practical and more effective than traditional microphone array beamforming for ISA systems. xxxxxx will pursue advanced development and prototype of the proposed technical solution for the ISA system. Directions for improvement that were established in xxxxxx I will be carefully followed, subjective evaluation will be carried out, and the ISA designs will be further optimized. Finally a real-time demo system will be built using either DSP or FPGA. It should be ready for testing and use by xxxxxx at the end of xxxxxx.	14129
Compact 2-Micron Transmitter for Remote Sensing Applications, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	Beyond Photonics proposes to develop a highly compact, efficient next-generation single-frequency pulsed transmitter laser for current and future xxxxxx missions focused on laser remote sensing in the short-wave infrared wavelength region near two microns.   More reliable and compact sources of this type are required for xxxxxx and commercial/military applications such as terrestrial and airborne xxxxxx winds, long-range measurement of molecular xxxxxx and xxxxxx concentrations in the atmosphere, and identification and tracking of fast moving hard targets (e.g. space debris, asteroids, docking).  We will emphasize the use of small but powerful lasers operating near 2 ?m and capitalize optimally on solid-state laser designs recently developed at Beyond Photonics as well as our team?s extensive past experience with this specific laser technology.  Efficient, compact hybrid approaches using bulk solid-state pulsed transmitters followed by doped-fiber amplification will be a focus to reach flexible performance on the order of 200 ?J/pulse, 0.5-8 kHz PRF, which can serve as an effective transmitter for many applications as-is in both coherent or direct detection lidar architectures, or which can be increased via further amplification as needed.  Operationally flexible Q-switched and injection seeded operation compatible with several different applications with differing requirements will be emphasized.  Very compact efficient MO laser technology will also be exploited and a prototype MO delivered in xxxxxx  xxxxxx will be explored to increase output pulse duration to narrow the transform-limited pulse spectra while maintaining very compact laser cavity length.  These innovations will apply directly to current xxxxxx missions and instruments (xxxxxx lidar, IPDA, LAS) and accelerate commercial development and availability of practical ground-based and airborne systems (e.g. compact airborne xxxxxx concentration-measuring instruments) at BP and elsewhere.	14130
Radiation-Hardened 1.55 Micron Fiber Laser for Coherent LIDAR, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	In this proposal, we propose to demonstrate and build high pulse energy near 1.55 micron wavelength single frequency fiber laser by developing an innovative polarization maintaining Er-doped gain fiber with extremely large mode field diameter. Such a single frequency high energy and high peak power fiber laser is needed for coherent lidar and sensing. We will enhance the radiation resistance of the gain fiber in order to make it suitable for xxxxxx applications. In xxxxxx I, we will design and fabricate Er-doped glasses, fiber preforms, and fibers. High pulse energy will be demonstrated. This proposed system will be all-fiber based, which offers excellent reliability. Successful demonstration of such a fiber laser can enable many new xxxxxx and commercial applications.	14131

This system would improve the speed and quality ofmaintenance procedures, and reduce error and risk. The specificenhancements we will investigate include: - Overlaying devices withrelevant telemetry. - Highlighting of items that require action, e.g., aswitch that needs to be flipped, a hose that needs to be removed, or abolt that needs to be tightened. - Information about consequences ofactions, e.g., if the bolt is removed, this assembly will be detached orif the switch is flipped then this panel will be powered on. - xxxxxxaids through planned procedures or activities. - Navigation aids, e.g.,where is the next device to be adjusted.	14133
The Role of Safety in IVHM - Chapter 9	2013-03-20	2018-07-19	When we address safety in a book on the business case for IVHM, the question arises whether safety isn’t inherently in conflict with the need of operators to run their systems as efficiently (and as cost effectively) as possible. The answer may be that the system needs to be just as safe as needed, but not significantly more. That begs the next question: How safe is safe enough? Several regulatory bodies provide guidelines for operational safety, but irrespective of that, operators do not want their systems to be known as lacking safety. We illuminate the role of safety within the context of IVHM.	14134
Electrical Microgravity Research in Colloidal Development Platform, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	The proposed innovation is a platform upon which to perform high voltage Electrical microGravity xxxxxxearch In colloidal xxxxxxment (E-xxxxxx). This platform will facilitate safe experimentation in space with colloidal samples at high voltages. E-xxxxxx will be comprised of three components: the experiment module, which houses the colloidal sample and electrodes; the high voltage safety tether, which provides three levels of safety interlocks; and the high voltage amplifier/function generator. Techshot has been involved in the development of numerous xxxxxxanced Colloidal Experiment modules designed to perform mixing and temperature control tasks. In the development of these modules, discussions with researchers revealed a common need: a high voltage source and platform to perform colloid assembly and dielectrophoresis experiments. The majority of experimentation has been performed in ground based laboratories, with the exception of a few microgravity experiments aboard parabolic-flight vehicles. This has substantially limited achievable science.E-xxxxxx is a direct response to this need. To perform these experiments, a high voltage amplifier and function generator capable of producing sinusoids and square waves with amplitudes as high as 10kV and frequencies ranging between DC and 100kHz are required. Achieving this in space is a substantial engineering task. Fortunately, Techshot has exceptional experience with high voltage safety, which can be applied to this project. Our xxxxxx safely operates aboard xxxxxx using an 80kV xxxxxx.We propose to space-qualify a commercial off-the-shelf amplifier/generator and pair it with a previously-developed Techshot experiment module. The experiment module is designed to work with the Techshot Dynamic xxxxxxscope Stage, which provides power, illumination, and communication to the experiment module when it is installed in Techshot's Mic-E (xxxxxxscope-EXPRESS) or xxxxxxght xxxxxxscopy xxxxxx.	14135
Onboard Autonomous Scheduling Intelligence System, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx the daily activities of the crew on a human space mission is currently a cumbersome job performed by a large team of operations experts on the ground.  This process is expensive, inflexible, and inconvenient for the crew in the spacecraft.  As mission durations increase, it will become vital to give the crew more autonomy and reduce operations costs.  We propose an Onboard Automated xxxxxx Intelligence xxxxxx (OASIS) that will automate scheduling work, giving the crew more autonomy and drastically reducing operations costs.	14136

Towards Prognostics for Electronics Components	2013-06-19	2018-07-19	xxxxxxnics components have an increasingly critical role in avionics systems and in the development of future aircraft systems. Prognostics of such components is becoming a very important research field as a result of the need to provide aircraft systems with system level health management information. This paper focuses on a prognostics application for electronics components within avionics systems, and in particular its application to an xxxxxx (IGBT). This application utilizes the remaining useful life prediction, accomplished by employing the particle filter framework, leveraging data from accelerated aging tests on IGBTs. These tests induced thermal-electrical overstresses by applying thermal cycling to the IGBT devices. In-situ state monitoring, including measurements of steady-state voltages and currents, electrical transients, and thermal transients are recorded and used as potential precursors of failure.	14138
Dust-Tolerant, High Pressure Oxygen Quick Disconnect for Advanced Spacesuit and Airlock Applications, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	Future human missions to xxxxxx, the xxxxxx, Near-xxxxxxs (NEOs) and other planetary bodies will require a spacesuit equipped with a compact, lightweight, reliable, dust tolerant, high pressure oxygen quick disconnect (QD) for astronaut extravehicular activity. The next generation of QDs must transfer high pressure oxygen (HPO2) between the vehicle and space suits under adverse conditions, including an extreme range of temperatures, in a high vacuum, and amid pervasive dust. Currently, no QDs deliver O2 at sufficient pressure, nor are they able to mate in the presence of dust.xxxxxx proposes to develop a dust tolerant, high pressure oxygen quick disconnect suitable for advanced spacesuit and airlock applications. This system will integrate form, fit, and function of existing and new subsystems for umbilical quick disconnects, leveraging both the design work completed to-date by Oceaneering (provided by xxxxxx) and the dust-tolerant QD connector prototypes that xxxxxx developed to xxxxxx 6 for spacesuit applications for xxxxxx Constellation program. These QDs have been successfully tested at 6x10-6 mbar coated in xxxxxx lunar dust simulant. Materials integral to the dust-tolerant system can perform acceptably at -160&#8304;C.The xxxxxx effort will focus on modifications necessary to apply existing dust-tolerant electrical connection technology (US Patent No. 8,011,941) to high-pressure oxygen delivery. This will include developing and performance testing a model in the presence of significant amounts of JSC-1A lunar simulant. A successful end point will demonstrate the design's capability to transmit gas over the interface and prevent dust from entering the gas stream over multiple mate/de-mate cycles. A design path will be laid out for xxxxxx 2 to address remaining technical challenges and create higher-fidelity hardware suitable for testing at xxxxxx.	14139
A Nonlinear Adaptive Approach to Isolation of Sensor Faults and Component Faults, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	Impact Technologies, LLC in collaboration with xxxxxx State xxxxxxersity and xxxxxx & xxxxxx, propose to develop innovative methods to differentiate sensor failure from actual system or component failure for advanced propulsion systems. In sharp contrast to many conventional methods which deal with either sensor failure or component failure but not both, our method considers sensor failure and component failure under one systematic and unified framework. The proposed solution consists of two main components: a bank of real-time nonlinear adaptive fault diagnostic estimators for residual generation and a Transferable Belief xxxxxx (TBM) based component for residual evaluation. By employing a nonlinear adaptive learning architecture, the presented approach is capable of directly dealing with nonlinear engine models and nonlinear faults without the need of linearization. xxxxxx sensitivity and robustness to modeling uncertainty is enhanced by several important techniques including adaptive reference nonlinear engine model, adaptive diagnostic thresholds, and TBM based residual evaluation method. Software modules will be developed and integrated into the xxxxxx C-MAPSS engine model for performance evaluation. A subset of core algorithms will be implemented and used in a hardware-in-the-loop demonstration under dSPACE environment to justify a xxxxxx Readiness xxxxxx of 4-5 at the conclusion of xxxxxx	14140

Comet Hitchhiker: Harvesting Kinetic Energy from Small Bodies to Enable Fast and Low-Cost Deep Space Exploration	2015-06-01	2018-07-19	"This idea can be intuitively understood by the analogy of fishing. Imagine a fisherman on a small boat tries to catch a big fish that runs at a high relative speed. Once the fish is on a hook, the experienced fisherman would let the line go while applying a moderate tension on it, instead of holding it tightly. If the line has a sufficient length, the boat can eventually catch up with the fish with moderate acceleration. This concept brings three novel capabilities: 1. Fuel-less landing and orbit insertion. We estimate that a comet hitchhiker spacecraft can obtain up to ~10 km/s of delta-V by using a carbon nanotube (CNT) tether. This level of delta-V enables a spacecraft to land on/orbit around long-period comets and xxxxxx belt objects (KBOs), which have not been even visited by any spacecraft yet. With existing technologies only a fly-by is realistic for these targets. 2. Non-gravitational slingshot around small bodies. A comet hitchhiker can obtain ~5 km/s of additional delta-V by utilizing just 25% of the harvested energy for reeling in the tether and/or driving electric propulsion engines. The tether is detached from the target after the desired delta-V is obtained. Our concept enables to design a fast trajectory to a wide range of destinations in the xxxxxxar xxxxxx by taking full advantage of the high relative velocity, abundance, and orbital diversity of small bodies. For example, by hitching a comet with q=0.5 AU, a comet hitchhiker can reach the current orbital distance of xxxxxx (32.6 AU) in 5.6 years and that of Haumea (50.8 AU) in 8.8 years. 3. xxxxxxp space energy production. Assuming 25% efficiency of regenerative brake, a 2-ton comet hitchhiker can produce ~25 GJ of energy, which is sufficient to drive an instrument with 1 kW power consumption over 290 days. If future storage device can achieve the energy density of gasoline, 25 GJ can be stored in 500 kg of mass, making it a potential energy source in the outer xxxxxxar xxxxxx. xxxxxx missions enabled by the comet hitchhiker concept are not only intellectually exciting but also crucial to achieve a xxxxxx strategic goals to \"ascertain the content, origin and evolution of the xxxxxxar xxxxxx.\" Three particular examples of such missions are 1) exploration of primitive bodies, which preserve the chemical composition at the formation of the xxxxxxar xxxxxx, 2) in-depth observation of KBOs, and 3) mapping of the distribution of interplanetary dust particles. All of the three science missions require a level of delta-V in deep space that is impractical or extremely costly using currently available technologies. Our concept brings important advantages over a related concept of tether-based flyby, which uses a fixed length of tether in order to change the direction of the relative velocity like gravity assist. This concept cannot be used for landing and orbit insertion because it does not reduce the relative speed. The comet hitchhiker concept is distinct in that it reels out a tether while applying regenerative brake force to accelerate itself, and at the same time, to harvest energy. This approach allows the spacecraft to match its velocity with that of the target, and as a result, enables soft landing on and orbit insertion around unexplored bodies such as long-period comets and KBOs. We strongly believe that the comet hitchhiker concept will advance the frontier of space exploration to the most exotic worlds in the xxxxxxar xxxxxx."	14142
Variable Geometry Radiators Using Shape Memory Alloys	2016-10-01	2018-07-19	"This application proposes groundbreaking research performed under the xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxearch Fellowship (NSTRF) Program. The proposed effort concerns the development of an innovative radiator concept that uses shape memory alloys (SMAs) to actuate passively in response to changes in its ambient thermal environment. In doing so, the radiator is capable of reconfiguring automatically to accommodate different thermal rejection requirements over the course of a mission. For example, during interplanetary travel, the radiator will be configured for minimal heat loss. When the spacecraft reaches a planetary surface, the radiator will automatically reconfigure itself to accommodate higher heat loads.In its Thermal Management xxxxxxs xxxxxx, xxxxxx emphasizes the importance of innovative radiator technology, citing it as \"perhaps the most critical thermal technology development for future spacecraft and space-based systems (TA-14-17).\" Indeed, such technology is critical for the future of space missions, as long-term crewed missions are difficult or impossible without it. The morphing SMA radiator concept in this application is truly revolutionary because it has the potential to improve several performance metrics simultaneously: mass, system complexity, reliability, and versatility.The details of the project proposal will be discussed further in the supporting documents of this application."	14143

Hydrogen Recovery System, Phase I	2011-01-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx hydrogen is used extensively by xxxxxx to support cryogenic rocket testing.  In addition, there are many commercial applications in which delivery and use of cryogenic hydrogen is more economical than gaseous hydrogen.  Unfortunately, loss of hydrogen resulting from boiloff can both increase the cost of the end product and create safety concerns.  xxxxxx and its teammates, The xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx and FuelCell Energy, xxxxxx., are developing a highly efficient xxxxxx Recovery xxxxxx (HRS) based on an electrochemical process that converts cool, gaseous hydrogen to pure, high pressure hydrogen that can be stored for subsequent use.

Parametric Amplifiers for Readout of Low-Temperature Detectors	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	This project aims to make microwave parametric amplifiers with high gain, large bandwidth, ultra-low noise, and low power dissipation. Our amplifiers are designed to have greatly improved gain characteristics over similar experimental devices.&nbsp;&nbsp; The amplifiers would enable revolutionary astrophysics instruments with far-infrared photon-counting detectors or high-resolution x-ray microcalorimeters. Our goal is to build microwave amplifiers with near quantum-limited sensitivity, octave or greater bandwidth, gain &gt; 20 dB for signals of frequency 1 &ndash; 10 GHz, and power dissipation less than 1 microwatt at a 100 mK operating temperature, or 1 milliwatt at 4 K. Such amplifiers would find immediate application in efforts to develop far infrared instruments based on xxxxxx (xxxxxxs), or in x-ray microcalorimeters with microwave SQUID amplifier (mSQUID) readout systems.Existing state-of-the-art broadband HEMT amplifiers used so far for xxxxxx or mSQUID readout have noise temperatures about 1 &ndash; 10 K. The noise of HEMTs, while low enough for many applications, limits sensitivity of xxxxxxs. In addition, the power dissipation of cryogenic HEMTs is not as low as desired in a space-based instrument. The new amplifiers in this project would be of great benefit in high performance instrument concepts involving xxxxxx or mSQUID arrays for astrophysics missions.	14146

We address Focus Area 9, xxxxxx Topic S1.08 Value Proposition: There is a need to measure the total atmospheric NHX load (xxxxxx+NH4+), with significant ecosystem implications including eutrophication, air quality, and indirectly on atmospheric radiative balance. Current xxxxxx analyzers miss most of the atmospheric xxxxxx load, present as fine aerosols.The xxxxxxovation: The front-end NH4+ reactor cycles between a line that passes gas phase xxxxxx to the CEAS analyzer, and then a line where NH4+ aerosols are converted to xxxxxx. A key innovation is flow path material, for which the literature is confused, with significant differences between xxxxxx formulations (factor of 10 difference in adsorption for PFA versus PTFE by one study).This fast, in situ, analyzers, will enable measurements at dramatically lower per sample cost and far greater data density than aerosol samplers. The ability to measure both xxxxxx and NH4+ sufficiently rapidly will allow characterization of the strong heterogeneity exhibited by these short-lived species with localized emissions.The NHxR is developed in collaboration with Los Gatos xxxxxxearch, a major manufacturer of state-of-the-art trace gas analyzers with extensive market awareness and well-established clients. BRI retains intellectual property to the NHxR and will license the NHxR for manufacture, potentially by LGR. LGR partnership provides significant commercialization advantages.

(ASC) is a small business that has developed 3D xxxxxx systems for space and terrestrial applications.  3D xxxxxx is ideal for determining real-time spacecraft trajectory, speed and orientation to the planet's surface, as well as evaluating potential landing sites.  xxxxxx sensors utilize a 3DFPA and rely on the illumination of a 10nsec pulse from a diode pumped solid state (DPSSL) q-switched xxxxxxYAG laser.  Improvements in pulse shape and stability are crucial to improve range resolution for higher resolution landing maps.  ASC is proposing an innovative approach to the laser and thermal management to meet xxxxxxs requirement for a compact, robust planetary landing sensor.  An innovative approach for an optically triggered \"semi-active\" q-switch will allow for increased power stability in a very compact laser design.  The semi-active fused q-switch will eliminate the need for a mechanical or electro optical q-switch by actively bleaching the passive q-switch with a laser diode.  The advantage of the Cr4:YAG crystal over active q-switches is that it can be fused directly onto the YAG laser rod creating a monolithic laser cavity reducing the number of coated surfaces and the overall size."	14149
Generating Autoclave-Level Mechanical Properties with Out-of-Autoclave Thermoplastic Placement of Large Composite Aerospace Structures, Phase I	2009-01-01	2018-07-19	"Out-of-autoclave thermoplastic tape/tow placement (TP-ATP) is nearing commercialization but suffers a moderate gap in mechanical properties compared with laminates fabricated via thermoset autoclave processing.  Out-of-autoclave thermoplastic processing significantly lowers composite aerospace part costs, but the property gap must be closed.  This STTR program, endorsed herein by Boeing and Cytec xxxxxxed Materials, will remedy the mechanical property shortfall and enable large composite aerospace structure important to xxxxxx to be manufactured without an autoclave.  xxxxxx is teaming with xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx -- Center for Composite Materials to apply their state-of-the-art TP-ATP process/property models to elucidate the physical mechanisms affecting microstructural quality that cause the property gap.  xxxxxx will be applied to the xxxxxx xxxxxx TP-ATP deposition head to optimize the head configuration and machine operating parameters, and the control systems for full mechanical properties.  xxxxxx will be manufactured to demonstrate the property improvements.

Broad-Band EUV Multilayer Coatings For Solar Physics, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop and commercialize a new class of aperiodic multilayer coating that is designed to provide high normal-incidence reflectance over a wide spectral band-pass in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) region, specifically from 9 to 14 nm. A broad-band reflective coating working at these wavelengths will enable, for the first time, the construction of high-resolution imaging spectrometers for solar physics utilizing diffraction gratings operating near normal incidence in this range, akin to previous instruments utilizing normal-incidence optics working at longer EUV wavelengths (i.e., lambda>17 nm) such as the xxxxxxxxEIS satellite instrument and the EUNIS sounding rocket instrument. The development of high-resolution, normal-incidence grating spectrometers operating in the 9&#150;14 nm range will in turn allow for detailed investigations of important solar emission lines, such as those from xxxxxx &#150; XXxxxxxx, that can provide unique diagnostics of high temperature plasma associated with solar flares and active regions. The successful development of efficient, broad-band EUV multilayers for the 9&#150;14 nm region as we propose will thus enable future flights of the EUNIS rocket to target this band, and will also enable the development of high resolution spectrometers that can meet the science requirements of future xxxxxx satellite missions, such as RAM, xxxxxxar-C and others that are currently being contemplated.	14151

A Compact, Light-weight, Reliable and Highly Efficient Heat Pump for Space Applications, Phase II	2006-11-01	2018-07-19	Extra-vehicular activities (EVA) on the xxxxxx and xxxxxx will require suits with sophisticated thermal control systems allowing astronauts to work for extended periods of time. Use of consumables such as water that cannot be easily replaced should be of particular concern. In this aspect the EVA suits for xxxxxx/xxxxxx environments need to be different from the current xxxxxx xxxxxx Mobility xxxxxxs (EMU) that require water sublimation into space for removing heat. Moreover, both the xxxxxx and xxxxxx environments are quite different from what conventional EMUs are exposed to. These variations call for careful analysis and innovative engineering for design and fabrication of an appropriate thermal control system.  Rini Technologies, xxxxxx. (RTI) proposes a novel and No/Low consumable approach to this problem.  With the feasibility of the RTI Miniature xxxxxx (MVCC) design demonstrated in xxxxxx I, this proposal explores the development of a novel MVCC system suitable for these rigorous environmental requirements.  In xxxxxx, RTI will build a compact prototype MVCC system capable of providing 250W of cooling while using 75W of electrical power.  Furthermore, the system will achieve xxxxxx 4 prior to the completion of the research activity	14154

Silicon Carbide Integrated Circuits for Extreme Environment Operation: High Radiation and High Temperature, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	To extend the survivability of high temperature extreme environment missions, we propose to design, fabricate and test silicon carbide integrated circuits that are radiation tolerant and high temperature operation capable. Bulk silicon electronics mostly cease to operate properly at temperatures above the 150C to 200C range due to high off-state leakage. The xxxxxx-On-Insulator version pushes this limit further to 300C; however, the xxxxxx surface exploration systems and gas giant probes require electronics that can operate above this temperature. A solution for high temperature electronics is the use of devices fabricated using wide bandgap semiconductors. xxxxxx carbide as being the most mature wide bandgap technology and shown to operate at temperature as high as 500-xxxxxx offers alternative device and circuit solutions for high temperature electronics. To this end, xxxxxx has the expertise to design, layout and fabricate silicon carbide integrated circuits to address this need, and extend the useful lifetime of vessels and probes in extreme environments.	14157
A Flexible Fault Management Architecture for Cluster Flight, Phase II	2016-04-01	2018-07-19	In the near future we will see the development of space mission architectures where multiple spacecraft work cooperatively as a cluster to achieve mission objectives. xxxxxx management (FM) is a critical challenge that must be addressed, especially when multiple spacecraft are working in proximity.  Automatic fault management reduces the effort required by the ground crew when faults occur, and it reduces the chance of collision by quickly recovering from faults. We are developing a Flexible xxxxxx for Distributed xxxxxxs (FFMDS) for these missions. FFMDS is a FM architecture that will include algorithms to be run on each cluster module for fault detection, isolation, and recovery; software to be used at a ground station to direct recovery actions; and protocols for communication of fault information between cluster modules and between modules and the ground station. The architecture is service-oriented, so that algorithms for fault detection, isolation, and recovery can be added to or subtracted from the system as appropriate.	14158

Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter-Based Polarimetric Spectral Sensor With Progressive Algorithm For Material Analysis and Mapping, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The prevalence of off earth landing missions both proposed and undertaken has been steadily increasing. With the proposal of missions, not only to xxxxxx, but also to comets, asteroids and outer planet moons, the ruggedness and robustness of equipment must meet the challenges of ever harsher environments. As a part of these missions, researchers wish to analyze the materials which make up the surface of these bodies and search for organic material. Brimrose proposes to develop a novel, compact, fast spectropolarimeter that will be capable of operating in the short wave infrared. The analysis of polarized light can help discriminate and classify materials and identify objects of. Measurement of polarization state can also provide various characteristics such as surface properties, shape, shading, and roughness, and can be used to identify unique features that will allow more accurate discrimination between various materials than spectral data alone. xxxxxxment of space-ready hardware and algorithms for the detection and analysis of polarized light in space based analysis applications is needed to enable high confidence material discrimination. The development of proposed full-scope spectropolarimeter will offer a dramatically improved optical solution for material analysis by performing fast spectral profile acquisition with an additional feature of complete polarization information.	14160
Non-Contact Magnetic Transmission For Hybrid/Electric Rotorcraft, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	"Electric propulsion has the potential to revolutionize aircraft design and architecture.  A distributed electric propulsion system for a VTOL aircraft can exploit aerodynamic benefits increasing the lift to drag ratio by 4 to 5 times (xxxxxx, Intl xxxxxxed xxxxxx Conf, Aug 2013) to that of conventional rotorcrafts.    xxxxxx physics principles can demonstrate that weight and efficiency optimized electric motors and propellers of the same power rating will rotate at different rpm making a transmission system/gearbox desirable.  High speed electric motors have excellent specific power whereas low speed propellers are more efficient.  In distributed propulsion systems there may be numerous individual propulsors making gearbox maintenance a significant effort that will detract from the potential cost savings of electric propulsion.  We propose a magnetic transmission (magnetic gearbox) design that will allow optimal matching of high specific power electric motors to efficient propellers for use on electric or hybrid-electric air vehicles.  The proposed magnetic transmission will have a mass of no more than an equivalent rated mechanical gearbox.  Unlike conventional gears the magnetic transmission will have no lubrication requirements, gear tooth wear, will be immune to vibration fatigue in the gear teeth, and will have minimal acoustic noise.  If overloaded the design will benignly \"slip a tooth\" and then re-engage.   We propose to design, build and test a magnetic transmission optimized for specific torque, and compare the weight of the system to an optimal mechanical gearbox of the same power.  We will also perform design studies to show how a magnetic gearbox could scale up to a helicopter main rotor gearbox."	14161

Weather Aware Route Planning (WARP), Phase II	2018-04-01	2018-07-19	In xxxxxx I of this xxxxxx xxxxxx project, Daniel H. Wagner Associates, xxxxxx., designed and demonstrated the feasibility of a system for integrating environmental data into flight planning and execution for xxxxxx Air xxxxxxs (UAS) in xxxxxx xxxxxx (NAS).  The Weather Aware Route xxxxxxning (WARP) system will provide weather-based Indicators and xxxxxx (I&W) and navigational recommendations for UAS in order to improve their autonomy, safety, and energy efficiency.  Using all available environmental and navigational data, WARP will assess environmental impacts to planned/executing flight plans and generate alerts and recommendations for those plans based on expected environmental impacts.  Operating in conjunction with existing and emerging mission planners and ground control systems (GCS), WARP will use a combination of rules-based/heuristic and simulation-based approaches to assess environmental impacts to UAS flight plans and provide I&W and recommendations for each UAS to avoid negative environmental impacts and take advantage of positive environmental impacts.  WARP will also provide real-time environmental impact assessments during mission execution, assisting ground-based pilots, and eventually UAS autonomous controllers, in performing dynamic re-planning for safer and more efficient flight.	14164
Frequency Tunable Piezoelectric Energy Harvester based on Crumpled MoS2 and Graphene	2021-08-01	2018-07-19	As most space missions are long-term, some lasting decades, and will be conducted entirely remotely, power generation issues become crucial especially given the constraints on power sources like fuel or energy harvesting systems on spacecraft. Conventionally used batteries are bulky, which sharply increases the mass of spacecraft and limits the amount of equipment that can be included on spacecraft, they pose a danger of explosion, are inconvenient to recharge, and suffer from limited life time. As a result, the development of light weight energy generation devices with high power outputs and low-cost is essential. Harvesting ambient energy is a possible solution to extend the limit of power production in space. Many researchers, including researchers at xxxxxx, have been working on energy harvesters to convert vibration energy into usable electric energy based on piezoelectric materials. In comparison with previously fabricated nanowire- and nanofilm-based nanogenerators, nanogenerators based on a single layer of xxxxxx have the advantage of withstanding enormous strains, while being light weight and possessing a high stiffness and high surface area to volume ratio. Thus, improvements on existing technology including greater efficiency, compact size and increased durability can be realized. These advancements in power generation enabled by nanomaterials will increase the capability of space missions extending lifetime and increasing scope. xxxxxx is proposed a flexible, frequency-tunable, light weight, high efficiency, and radiation tolerant structural piezoelectric energy harvester based on overlap structures of crumpled xxxxxx and graphene that resonate in a longitudinal direction. In order to increase the performance of flexible harvesting devices using xxxxxx, it is highly desirable to utilize the longitudinal electromechanical coupling coefficient and piezoelectric voltage constant due to the large displacements along the longitudinal direction. The proposed energy harvester is based a spring and mass system. Each crumpled monolayer xxxxxx-graphene pair is clamped on the opposite sides of a proof mass and the crumpled monolayer of piezoelectric xxxxxx act as a spring in this system. This system enables the conversion of external vibration to longitudinal vibration of the central proof mass. This longitudinal vibration induces strains, compressive on one side and tensile on the other, on both piezoelectric monolayers of xxxxxx. xxxxxx generation can be achieved by deriving a current from the potential difference between the two piezoelectric monolayers of xxxxxx. The system resonant frequency results from the effective mechanical stiffness which is dependent on the mechanical properties of the crumpled xxxxxx. This resonance will result in maximum longitudinal wave propagation when the system experiences vibrations on resonance, leading to the maximum potential difference between the piezoelectric monolayer xxxxxx pairs. In this regard, the proposed energy harvester is designed to have frequency-tunability, by controlling the crumpling of the xxxxxx monolayers, improving power output. To realize the proposed system, there are four key research objectives. First we will pursue fundamental studies on (1) the effect of crumpling on the effective mechanical stiffness of xxxxxx and (2) the effect of crumpling on the piezoelectric coefficient of xxxxxx. We will then (3) investigate the power generation response to different modes of vibration frequencies. This is important because, in real world systems, nanogenerators are subject to far more varied modes of vibrations. Investigation of the proposed devices response to different modes of vibration frequencies will be used to confirm the frequency tunability of our energy harvester and compare its energy conversion efficiency to existing technologies. (4) The final goal of this this project will be integration of multiple arrays into a full comprehensive structural, flexible energy harvester.	14165

Icy Regolith Excavation and Volatile Capture under Vacuum Conditions	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	This project will provide xxxxxx with a testbed for demonstrating mining technologies involving the excavation of icy planetary regolith&nbsp;and the extraction of sublimated solid volatiles from icy regolith collected&nbsp;under environmental conditions similar to those found on asteroids, xxxxxx, and the xxxxxx. xxxxxx xxxxxx&nbsp;is developing a testbed&nbsp;for producing large volume mixtures of ice and regolith under low pressure inside a laboratory vacuum chamber. This will allow those&nbsp;technologies that are being developed to excavate and utilize icy planetary regolith, to be tested and evaluated during actual operation&nbsp;under simulated surface conditions such as those&nbsp;found&nbsp;on asteroids, xxxxxx, and the xxxxxx.The results of testing under relevant environmental conditions will be used to validate existing or future physical models that predict excavation forces related to mining planetary regolith, and&nbsp;to determine the amount of energy required to excavate the regolith and to sublimate solid volatiles contained in icy regolith.	14168
Global Identification of Noncoding RNAs in S. cerevisiae	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	Genome-wide detection of novel non-coding xxxxxxs in S. cerevisiae by modulating an RNase P pathway through the depletion of a component RPP1. Nearly 400,000 36-mer oligonucleotide probes tiling the entire yeast genome including the mitochondrial chromosome with an average gap of 10 bases between two consecutive probes were synthesized on glass slides using a mask-less array synthesizer. xxxxxx samples for hybridizing to the arrays were extracted from a conditional lethal allele of S. cerevisiae created by placing the RPP1 gene under control of GAL10 promoter. It allowed the expression of RPP1 in galactose-containing culture medium but suppressed its expression in glucose-containing medium. A wild-type isogenic strain was used as a control. Both strains were initially grown in galactose-containing medium and subsequently transferred and resuspended into glucose-containing medium. Eight arrays were hybridized with xxxxxx extracted from the Rpp1-depleted cells at 0 4 7 12 16 21 30h and the control cell at 30h after initial transfer to glucose-containing medium.	14169
Distilling the Verification Process for Prognostics Algorithms	2013-12-05	2018-07-19	The goal of prognostics and health management (PHM) systems is to ensure system safety, and reduce downtime and maintenance costs. It is important that a PHM system is verified and validated before it can be successfully deployed. Prognostics algorithms are integral parts of PHM systems. This paper investigates a systematic process of verification of such prognostics algorithms. To this end, first, this paper distinguishes between technology maturation and product development. Then, the paper describes the verification process for a prognostics algorithm as it moves up to higher maturity levels. This process is shown to be an iterative process where verification activities are interleaved with validation activities at each maturation level. In this work, we adopt the concept of technology readiness levels (xxxxxxs) to represent the different maturity levels of a prognostics algorithm. It is shown that at each xxxxxx, the verification of a prognostics algorithm depends on verifying the different components of the algorithm according to the requirements laid out by the PHM system that adopts this prognostics algorithm. Finally, using simplified examples, the systematic process for verifying a prognostics algorithm is demonstrated as the prognostics algorithm moves up xxxxxxs.	14170

A Planning and Control Toolkit for Dual Arm Manipulation, Phase II	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	It is often difficult to create autonomous robotic capabilities that match what can be achieved via teleoperation. Even though it is mechanically possible for a humanoid robot such as xxxxxx to perform complex coordinated tasks such as tying a knot, exchanging objects between end effectors, plugging in connectors, unscrewing a cap, opening a door, or grasping large objects with two hands, our lack of planning algorithms makes it difficult to control these behaviors autonomously. The lack of planning and control algorithms also impedes human-robot interaction as it is difficult for manipulation robots to plan arm trajectories in real-time using active sensing to avoid collisions with humans. This proposal is to develop a suite of planning and control algorithms that will enable xxxxxx robots to perform complex manipulation behaviors in a coordinated way. This work would benefit xxxxxx by making xxxxxx robots more capable and useful during autonomous tasks, by enabling remote supervisors to command more complex tasks, and by enabling xxxxxx robots to operate safely alongside humans during shared tasks.	14173

Fiber Optic Health Monitoring of 3D Woven Preforms and Composites Employing Structurally Integrated Sensors, Phase I	2017-06-01	2018-07-19	Woven TPS (WTPS) is an attractive option for thermal protection because it allows for a design to be tailored to a specific mission ? material composition can be adjusted by weaving different fiber types together and controlling their placement using computer-controlled, automated, 3D weaving technology. xxxxxx?s HEEET program is responsible for the development of WTPS, with the objective of enabling a broad range of missions. With complex material systems such as WTPS, there exists a need for in situ xxxxxx (SHM) capability designed to diagnose and report any degradation in the capability of the structure. The primary objective of the proposed effort is to leverage MR&D?s micromechanics-based Program Suite to interpret measured temperature and strain data derived from fiber optic sensors that are structurally integrated in a 3D woven composite panel. Specifically, measured strains at the constituent level will be used to compute a local stress state in several 3D woven composite test specimens under a variety of thermal and structural loads. Measured temperature data will dictate which temperature-dependent constituent material properties to use in the micromechanics model. The proposed research offers a software solution for providing a physics based interpretation of sensor data acquired at the constituent level of a 3D woven structure and computes an effective composite level response for the purposes of evaluating structural health in near real time.	14176

Polymer Nanowire-Based Reversible, and Quasi Real-Time, Ethylene Analyzer, Phase II	2019-06-01	2018-07-19	As called out in the xxxxxx Technical xxxxxx (TA7), in-orbit or deep space-based plant growth systems are of interest to xxxxxx as part of fundamental space research and for ensuring supply of fresh produce to the crew for sustainable human spaceflight. xxxxxx gas is a natural plant metabolite and phytohormone. In enclosed spaceship settings, ethylene build-up can be deleterious to plants. Thus, there is a need to monitor ethylene in real-time, sensitively, reversibly and effectively. State of the art technology is limited in terms of portability and ability for in-situ measurements with desired selectivity and sensitivity. To close this technology gap, xxxxxxoxxxxxx LLC (ISL) will continue developing a space-compatible, xxxxxx xxxxxxwire based ethylene Monitor or PNet-Mon (TM). In xxxxxx I, ISL fabricated a compact breadboard PNet-Mon device that demonstrated response to ppb levels of ethylene with immunity to interfering metabolites. In xxxxxx, ISL will optimize fabrication of the reversible sensor, develop prototype hardware having xxxxxx-relevant footprint. The PNet-Mon prototype will be evaluated rigorously first under laboratory conditions. We have teamed with a prime contractor for testing the prototype in xxxxxxanced xxxxxxt xxxxxx (APH) system with the goal of integrating PNet-Mon with APH system for delivery to xxxxxx.	14179
Aerodynamic Optimization for Distributed Electro Mechanical Actuators, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	Traditional hydraulic actuation and control surface layout both limit span wise control of lift distribution, and require large volume within wing cross-section, ultimately reducing efficiency. Mounting and support structures for traditional actuators, also necessitate drag-inducing protrusions in otherwise ideally smooth airfoils. Consequently, hydraulic systems are heavy and energy intensive as compared to electromechanical counterparts. Coupling distributed EMAs with novel controls optimizing lift distribution in real-time during flight allows lighter, thinner, and more flexible wing structure. xxxxxx xxxxxximization used to couple control formulation for any point in flight with aeroelastic model of the wing. xxxxxx distribution of EMAs will guide actuator placement and aid design and sizing of flexible wing system that maximizes L/D. xxxxxx has used both distributed local flow sensors and on-board fiber-optic strain sensors, which along with novel control algorithms allow for on-board, near real-time control calculations to be completed, creating adaptive wing shapes, and optimize L/D within the flight envelope.	14180

Hard X-ray Photoelectric Polarimeter	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	Our objective is to determine the gas mixtures and pressures that would enable a sensitive, hard X-ray polarimeter using existing flight components&nbsp;with the goal of making astrophysical measurements using the InFOC&mu;S hard X-ray optics on a long duration balloon flight (future proposal following successful demonstration). xxxxxx allows high sensitivity, low systematics polarization measurements, and photoelectric absorption remains the dominant interaction at energies up to 50-100 keV for many intermediate Z absorbers (xxxxxxure 1).&nbsp; xxxxxx and GSFC have made substantial investments in the Time Projection Chamber polarimeter proposed for GEMS and PRAXyS. As PRAXyS was ultimately not selected for flight development, we propose to capture the investment and modify the PRAXyS proto-flight detectors to operate from ~10-50 keV using an xxxxxx based mixture as the active gas.&nbsp; The broad outline is to measure the characteristics of xxxxxx based mixtures, retrofit the PRAXyS detectors for high pressure operation, and prepare for a balloon flight using the InFocus balloon payload to pave the way to a dedicated mission.&nbsp;	14182
Integrated Composite - Heatpipe Radiator Panel, Phase II	2013-05-01	2018-07-19	High performance thermal control technologies are needed to achieve the near term goals of xxxxxx science spacecraft development programs. High conductivity materials to minimize temperature gradients and provide high efficiency radiators and heat spreader panels are required.  xxxxxxted panels that minimize the challenges caused by thermal interfaces, including those of attached heat pipes and cooling loops would provide high performance and high reliability. kTC proposes a general technology development that permits the design of a high performance thermal distribution panel (TDP). The panel will be fabricated with a high conductivity macro-composite skin and in situ heat pipes.  This advanced TDP concept will have high conductance that will obviate the need for bulky metal thermal doublers and heat pipe saddles. The conductivity of the proposed material system can be configured to exceed 800 W/mK with a density below 2.5 g/cm3. This material can provide efficient conductive heat transfer between the in situ heat pipes permitting the use of thinner panels further reducing the mass.kTC proved the feasibility of producing the proposed TDP and confirmed by measurements the performance gains the technology affords in the xxxxxx I program.  xxxxxx work will concentrate on process refinements and scale up.	14183

Resistive Memory Devices for Radiation Resistant Non-Volatile Memory	2018-08-01	2018-07-19	Ionizing radiation in space can damage electronic equipment, corrupting data and even disabling computers.  Radiation resistant (rad hard) strategies must be employed to prolong the usefulness of electronics in space.  Current rad hard strategies use redundant wiring or failsafe programming to minimize radiation damage.  These strategies have drawbacks.  Redundant wiring increases the amount of circuitry required, while failsafe programming typically requires extra memory, and can slow data processing.  Rather than employ secondary rad hard strategies, we seek to build electronic components that are inherently rad hard.  xxxxxxistive memory is a promising new form of memory that appears to be resistant to radiation.  Hafnium oxide-based ReRAM has been show to have some degree of resistance to radiation damage.  xxxxxx oxide-based ReRAM has not been investigated, but has several properties making it superior to hafnium oxide for memory applications.  Therefore, a comprehensive study of the radiation resistance of tantalum oxide will be performed.  Further investigations with hafnium oxide will also be performed for comparison.  Devices will be irradiated primarily with protons, alpha particles, gamma rays, and x-rays.  xxxxxx will range from a few hundred keV to 1 MeV.	14185
Unstructured, High-Order Scheme Module with Low Dissipation Flux Difference Splitting for Noise Prediction, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	Thorough understanding of aircraft airframe and engine noise mechanisms and the subsequent acoustic propagation to the farfield is necessary to develop and evaluate noise mitigation concepts. Therefore, continued assessment and development of advanced prediction methodologies and tools is essential. Despite significant progress made in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in past several decades, some production unstructured CFD codes used at xxxxxx for noise prediction are only 2nd order accurate at best. In this xxxxxx study, we propose to develop a modular high-order scheme with low dissipation flux difference splitting that can be integrated into existing CFD codes for use in improving the solution accuracy and to enable better prediction of complex physics and noise mechanisms and propagation.  The salient features of our proposed approach include: (1) high-resolution schemes with physics-based low-dissipation flux-difference splitting; (2) very low memory requirements; and (3) modular structure for easy integration into existing CFD codes. During xxxxxx I, a module providing 3rd order accurate schemes will be developed and integrated into xxxxxx code. Verification and validation studies will be conducted to demonstrate the improved solution accuracy. During xxxxxx, 4th order accurate schemes will be developed and implemented with xxxxxx, and the performance of improved schemes will be assessed for realistic aeroacoustic problems. xxxxxxive use of high-order schemes near solution discontinuities (such as shocks) will be investigated. xxxxxx plans will also consider integration of the high-order module with other unstructured CFD codes such as USM3D and xxxxxx/CHEM.	14186

(xxxxxx) proposes tank bladders compatible with advanced monopropellants.  xxxxxx is well underway in development of polymer liners for lightweight propulsion tanks for containment of gelled inhibited red fuming nitric acid (IRFNA) and monomethylhydrazine (MMH) under an Army Redstone Arsenal contract in collaboration with partner xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx (NGST).  Most xxxxxx bladders are composed of FEP thermoplastic fluoropolymer into which glass flake is compounded for additional barrier properties.  xxxxxx flakes within the polymer matrix overlap to yield tortuous paths to chemicals that might otherwise migrate through a polymer matrix. When needed, we also incorporate auxiliary fluorinated silicate coating or even pure gold plate within the bladder interior.  Fluoropolymers, glass, gold and silicate coatings are all materials well known for chemical inertness.  xxxxxx's innovation is to combine the materials in a form that yields a flexible bladder which serves as an inert barrier for monopropellant containment and stability.  The time is ripe to expand compatibility testing of xxxxxx's bladder technology to advanced monopropellants for SMD needs.	14188

The key innovation required to provide a sub-system for longer-term missions is to develop catalyst technologies that maintain a high degree of activity and physical stability over multi-year operational lives. The high catalytic activity of noble metals combined with the surface area and adsorptivity of activated carbon are the ideal combination of parameters for achieving the highest level of performance at the lowest penalty for a post-processing sub-system. The problem has been the physical breakdown of traditional activated carbon catalyst supports. To address this problem, the xxxxxx I and previous intermittent research efforts have shown that noble metal catalysts supported on Porous xxxxxx xxxxxx, exhibit superior physical properties to alumina, ceramic and granular activated carbon-supported catalysts currently used by xxxxxx and throughout the chemical process industries. The Porous xxxxxx xxxxxx-based catalysts are proposed due to their remarkable hardness and physical stability combined with their high surface area and surface activity. xxxxxx I continued the successful demonstration and scale-up of the technology, demonstrating that the reactors can be manufactured with high surface area and porosity and good internal consistency, as well as demonstrating that the catalytic activity is extremely high under very mild conditions. The Porous xxxxxx carbon reactor scale-up will be completed in xxxxxx to xxxxxx-sized reactors that will be fabricated, tested and characterized using advanced analytical methods that will yield a fully quailifiable protocol for manufacturing the reactors for xxxxxx flight implementation.	14190
A Compact Coronagraph Design for Heliophysics Missions	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	A compact coronagraph design will greatly reduce the mass, volume, and cost of coronagraphs. This project will develop a compact coronagraph design for Heliophysics missions and test and evaluate the design.xxxxxxgraphs need to block the photospheric light of the xxxxxx, so the corona (about a million times dimmer than the photosphere) can be imaged. Blocking the photospheric light is possible by an external occulting disk (occulter) in front of the objective lens of the solar telescope. An internal occulter, after the objective elements and other stops are positioned and sized, is used to reject light from the solar disk. One of the constant problems in coronagraphs is the photospheric light diffracted by the external occulter that enters into the coronagraph system due to scattering by the optical elements. Thus a successful rejection of the diffracted light is one of the key aspects of any coronagraph system.  By suitably designing the occulters and stops the intensity of diffracted and scattered light needs to be reduced.	14191
BRDF, ALBEDO, CLOUD AND AEROSOL RADIOMETER	2013-10-01	2018-07-19	The proposed airborne instrument, BACAR (BRDF: bidirectional reflectance-distribution function, xxxxxx, xxxxxx and xxxxxx) will demonstrate radiometrically accurate measurements from the xxxxxx to xxxxxx (19 channels), including polarization, from a single instrument, which is unprecedented, and will overcome significant technological challenges in optical design with high optical throughput and SNR (signal-to-noise ratio), as well as fast data readouts and processing. BACAR will expand the current CAR (xxxxxx Absorption xxxxxx) airborne science capability and build on its BRDF legacy in important ways that will have particular impact in the following areas: (i) snow & ice mapping, (ii) wildfires, (iii) natural resources mapping, (iv) volcano monitoring, (v) surface-temperature determination & radiation balance constraints, (vi) cloud studies, (vii) air pollution studies, and (viii) acute pollution-event monitoring. The entire BACAR project is organized following a standard design/build top-level process that includes: conceptual design, trade studies, preliminary design, critical design and fabrication/test.	14192

The grating will have mirror surfaces on both faces for high efficiency in high orders. The grating will be manufactured using a 3/4 ton air bearing grating carriage that oscillates at 30 strokes per minute between two non-contact magnetic fields.

W-band Solid State Transceiver for Cloud Radar	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	This proposed effort seeks to develop a solid state power amplifier (SSPA)-based W-band cloud radar transceiver and demonstrate it on the GSFC airborne xxxxxx xxxxxx (CRS). Compared to the current xxxxxx-based W-band transceiver, this solid state transceiver will be significantly more compact in size, lower weight with improved reliability since it does not require high-voltages. The proposed work focuses on the evaluation and testing of the W-band SSPA on the current airborne xxxxxx xxxxxx (CRS) transceiver so that it can be operated with either the original xxxxxx-based transmitter, or the SSPA. We will swap in either transmitter to maintain the current EIK capability. As we gain more confidence in the SSPA-based transmitter, we will migrate entirely to this approach.&nbsp; This SSPA-based transceiver will enable the usage a number of recently developed radar techniques, such as advanced versatile Tx/Rx waveform, ultra-low sidelobe pulse compression, and frequency diversity. &nbsp;It is necessary to modify the hardware and firmware in order to accommodate the above new techniques. Recent advances to HIWRAP&rsquo;s advanced waveform generation need to be transferred to CRS to take full advantage of the SSPA. The resulting work is readily applicable to upcoming cloud and precipitation radar spaceborne missions.&nbsp;&nbsp;	14195
Low Temperature Trash Gasification Reactor, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	Converting in-situ resources into propellants, energy storage reactants, or other useful products at the site of exploration, known as in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), instead of transporting these supplies from Earth can significantly reduce the cost and risk of human exploration while at the same time enabling new mission concepts and long term exploration sustainability. xxxxxx needs innovative gasification reactors to convert trash into useful intermediate products such as carbon dioxide and water, which can ultimately be used to make methane and oxygen for propulsion and energy generation applications.  Unfortunately, partial oxidation reactors and incinerators that might be used to reduce trash to useful products operate at high temperatures and also create ash, tar and other undesirable by-products.  TDA xxxxxxearch has developed a low temperature (< 135 degrees C) ozone oxidation process that efficiently and cleanly converts trash into carbon dioxide and water.  These intermediate products can then be delivered to a xxxxxx reactor for the production of methane and oxygen.  xxxxxxver, our reactor was designed for use on the moon or xxxxxx whereas future spacecraft will need systems able to function in zero-g and micro-g environments.  Therefore, TDA proposes to develop a trash gasification reactor that uses our ozone oxidation process and will work in the absence of gravity.  In this project we will conduct the analysis and experiments to design the reactor.	14196
Building a Rice Decision Support System to Support Global Food Security and Commodity Markets, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx is an important crop globally that influences food security and the Earth system. xxxxxx is the predominant food staple in many regions with approximately 700 million tons of production annually across the globe. xxxxxx is sensitive to a variety of drivers that can adversely impact production and efficiency including weather variability and inter-seasonal volatility, water resources, and risk management decisions (e.g., pests). Futures are a tool used to manage or hedge risk, reduce volatility, improve food security, and maximize efficiency and profit on the open market. Currently, the rice futures market has little high quality and timely information available to make strategic or application specific decisions to reduce risk and maximize profit. The global rice futures market is thinly traded causing extreme price fluctuation orders of magnitude. This innovation gap has created an opportunity to build an operational xxxxxx Decision Support xxxxxx to support the rice futures market. The overarching goal of this xxxxxx xxxxxx I xxxxxx is to evaluate the feasibility of a xxxxxx Decision Support xxxxxx (xxxxxxDSS) to Support xxxxxx Food xxxxxxurity and Commodity Markets.  xxxxxxDSS brings together operational remotely sensed mapping of rice, crop production modeling, and weather forecasts to seamlessly generate near real time information on rice extent, growth stages, yield forecasts and statistical uncertainty. xxxxxxDSS uses state-of-the-art web-GIS and mobile technologies to support visualization and delivery of information to futures markets and food security programs.	14197
Ion Mass Spectrometer for Heliospheric Missions	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	We are developing and IMS that can be used to measure the solar wind ion composition and measure interstellar pick up ions. This instrument will support a future heliospheric missions that measures fast neutrals from the outer boundaries of the solar wind. This instrument will have unique ion composition capabilities and will be designed to work in the transient energetic particle events such as Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRS), xxxxxxl xxxxxx Ejections (CMEs) and xxxxxxar Energetic xxxxxx (SEP) events.&nbsp; In addition, the IMS can be used for planetary missions including missions with high radiation environment such as Io and xxxxxx.We are developing this instrument based on an ongoing development effort, completing 9.5-27 MeV irradiation tests of microchannel plate (MCP) shielding designs, and ion beam testing the instrument&#39;s tapered linear electric field time-of-flight section using the Suprathermal Ion xxxxxx xxxxxxmetry xxxxxx at xxxxxx for ion energies from 100 V to 15 kV.

Model Development and Experimental Validation of Reactive Gas and Pyrolysis Product Interactions with Hot Carbon Chars	2018-01-01	2018-07-19	Ablative thermal protection system (TPS) materials are required for the extreme heating encountered during hypersonic entry into the xxxxxx, xxxxxxian, and xxxxxx xxxxxxet atmospheres as well as for manned and sample-return missions into the terrestrial atmosphere. This proposal addresses the Topic 1: xxxxxxanced Thermal Protection Materials xxxxxx. xxxxxxearch pertaining to TPSs, specifically the ablative materials used for TPSs, remains one of the main focal points of xxxxxx technology development, with TPSs mentioned in 7 of 14 space technology roadmaps. The research proposed here is most closely associated with TA09: xxxxxx, xxxxxx and xxxxxxding.We propose to provide high-quality experimental data to support the development of high-fidelity, physics-based ablation models that include internal reactions and the chemical evolution of pyrolysis gases within hot carbon chars. Our primary objectives are to: (i) perform experiments with well-controlled test conditions and quantified uncertainties on all relevant test variables; (ii) conduct these experiments in a configuration that can be directly simulated by using  coupled Fluid Dynamics (FD) and Material xxxxxx (MR) codes, and (iii) use the data in a high fidelity coupled FD/MR framework to extract parameters and validate models.We propose a 3-year research program to accomplish our objectives. We will investigate both internal oxidation reactions in partially dissociated air flows and the chemical evolution of representative pyrolysis gas mixtures by heterogeneous surface reactions with a hot char. Experiments will be performed in a furnace-heated, flow tube configuration, using a porous carbon material as a char simulant. We will regulate input mass flow rates, measure absolute and differential pressures across the porous specimen, and monitor sample temperatures. We will use a microwave discharge and chemical titration techniques to produce and quantify partially dissociated air flows and calibrated gas mixtures representative of incipient phenolic pyrolysis products to study the chemical evolution of pyrolysis gases. Gas compositions will be monitored as a function of temperature, pressure, and flow rate after they exit the hot carbon char simulant using a combination of advanced mass spectroscopic techniques. xxxxxxes in char density, permeability, and microstructure due to oxidative attack or carbon deposition by coking reactions will be documented and correlated with gas composition measurements. xxxxxx electron microscopy analyses of specimens prior to and post furnace heating will be implemented to characterize changes in the microscale morphology and chemical composition of the char upon carbon fibers/ pyrolysis gases interactions.We will use the data obtained through the experiments in a numerical modeling framework designed to simulate detailed coupling problems that involved pure flow and porous media. The framework couples a FD solver with a MR code through detailed mass, momentum and energy balance, which ensures that transport phenomena at the interface are captured. We will use the non-reacting experimental results to validate the coupling scheme and calculate the macroscopic parameters such as permeability, in porous modeling zone. Finally, we will assemble a finite-rate chemistry model using a volume-averaged technique for gas-surface interactions inside the porous chars. We will use the data to select and calibrate the kinetic rates.The benchmark data sets generated by this work are essential for modelers to construct and validate internal reaction and pyrolysis gas evolution models for high-fidelity ablation simulations. The outcome of this research will raise the xxxxxx Readiness xxxxxx of the MR codes used for predicting ablation performance in real flight environments. The long term payoff for xxxxxx will be a more sophisticated suite of MR codes with advanced flow field coupling capabilities for ablative TPS sizing.	14199

Miniaturized Airborne Instrument for N2O, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	Nitrous Oxide (xxxxxx) is an important greenhouse gas, as well as a tracer for stratospheric air mass. We propose to design a miniaturized xxxxxx detector based on direct absorption spectroscopy that is able to be deployed on SIERRA class and xxxxxx Hawk UAVs using many of the same functional elements as Aerodyne xxxxxxearch's commercial mini-QCL trace gas instruments. Achieving this will allow for better source attribution of xxxxxx as well as providing an important tool for understanding mixing processes between the troposphere and stratosphere. Specifically, our proposal calls for exploring two designs for a low-volume in-line multipass absorption cells; passive cooling of the laser and instrument electronics, a simplified low-power electronics design and computer, and low-power vacuum pump. The goal for xxxxxx I will be the successful identification, design, and testing of components that can be integrated into a small UAV-compatible instrument packaged during xxxxxx.	14208
Magnesium Hall Thruster for Solar System Exploration, Phase I	2012-02-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx proposes to prove the feasibility of a xxxxxx effect thruster system that would open the door for xxxxxx xxxxxxource Utilization (ISRU) based solar system exploration.  Elemental magnesium has favorable thermophysical properties and is very easy to ionize.  The estimated specific impulse for a high efficiency magnesium xxxxxx thruster operating off of a standard 400 V power processing unit is 5000 s.  Efficiencies >50% will be possible.  xxxxxxhough the vapor pressure of Mg is relatively low, it is believed that spacecraft interactions can be managed through the implementation of a simple plume shield.  Moreover, magnesium is found abundantly in the regolith of xxxxxx and the xxxxxx, from which it can be readily extracted.In xxxxxx I, we will prove the concept's feasibility through four technical tasks.  In the first task, the overall architecture of a xxxxxx thruster system will be established and subsystem requirements will be identified.  In the second task, xxxxxx will integrate an magnesium vapor propellant xxxxxx thruster with a wire feed system.  In the third task, the integrated system will be tested in xxxxxx facilities.

Robotic Tool Changer for Planetary Exploration, Phase I	2008-08-01	2018-07-19	Future planetary exploration missions will require compact, lightweight robotic manipulators for handling a variety of tools & instruments without increasing the weight of the robot arm. The current design philosophy of MER, Beagle 2, xxxxxx & MSL, sees select tools and instruments permanently affixed to the arm end-effector.  Future missions will be size & mass constrained and will need to be more capable than their predecessors. One technical solution that would enable deployment of multiple tools and instruments from a compact, lightweight manipulator is an electromechanical coupler or tool changing mechanism which can reliably take a tool or instrument out of a magazine and couple it, form-locking and force-locking, to the end-effector.The program's ultimate goal is to develop and demonstrate a highly reliable and scalable robotic tool-change system in a relevant environment from a relevant robotic platform. In xxxxxx I, we will perform a detailed investigation of robotic tool-changer requirements, design strategies and tall poles for robotic systems exploring xxxxxx and the xxxxxx, including first order experiments to verify feasibility of specific enabling design features. xxxxxx such as cycles, stiffness, strength, repeatability, misalignment-tolerance and electrical characteristics will be derived by considering MER and xxxxxx as models for instrument type and operational patterns, robotic arm capability and environment and by deriving future mission requirements.  There are a few terrestrial applications (ROVs in the off-shore oil industry) and space applications (xxxxxx and xxxxxx RMS xxxxxxching End-Effector system) for which a subset of design strategies may be applicable.

Chemical Microsensor Instrument for UAV Airborne Atmospheric Measurements, Phase II	2017-11-01	2018-07-19	The rapid expansion of available UAV types and increased mission capability (payload, flight duration, and system cost reductions) offers wide range of potential applications.  The xxxxxx Chemical xxxxxx xxxxxx (AMS) instrument package being developed adapts low cost and low power chemical microsensor technology which has been demonstrated for fire detection and exhaust emission monitoring to airborne measurements.  The fast time response and miniaturized system will provide a lightweight, low cost instrument for package for a wide range of deployments including aerostats (balloons and kites) to UAV such as xxxxxx Eye and SIERRA. Chemical species mapping using UAVs enables model validation and attaining new data that complements and augments traditional aerial and satellite data.  xxxxxxver, there currently are limited options adapting commercial chemical sensors for detecting all species of interest at the levels required, and with fast response time.  xxxxxx electrochemical cells, which provide accurate measurement for some species, are typically slow (30-60 sec), sensitive to pressure changes, and are a potential hazard from leakage.  Most commercial environmental carbon dioxide monitors are based on NDIR, with response time in the order of minutes.  xxxxxx are monitored by generic combustible gas sensors.  xxxxxxents need to be low cost, compact and robust enough for incorporation in UAV systems, capable of surviving hard landings and sufficiently low cost that damage to the instrument and or loss of the UAV is not a major setback for the mission.  The proposed solid-state, microsensor technology is well suited for this application, because of the low production cost and robust packaging.  The proposed program provides a low cost instrument (less than $1000 in limited quantities) for real-time carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and methane detection.	14212
High Temperature Chemical Sensor Array Payload For UAV Based In-situ Volcanic Gas Measurements, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	Makel xxxxxxing, xxxxxx. proposes to develop a low cost, UAV based microsensor array payload for monitoring volcanic processes such as plume vents and hot lava flows.  xxxxxx arrays, each consisting of four to eight high temperature sensors for species such as OCS, HF, HCl, NOx, CO, SOx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, O2, and xxxxxx, will be packaged with electronics and data transmission capability.  The high temperature thick and film microsensors for the species of interest have been developed for xxxxxx atmospheric measurement under a previous xxxxxx program.  This sensor technology will be the basis of this low cost UAV payload for Earth science missions.   The microsensor array packages will be integrated into lightweight payloads (under 200 gm) that can be suspended under a small UAV multi-copter for measurements near lava flows.  xxxxxxernately, the microsensor array payload can be packaged as a dropsonde and deployed in regions which are too hostile for low altitude UAV flight.   The xxxxxxcanic xxxxxx Array xxxxxx (VMAS) packaging will designed to enable the sensors to be used for prolonged operation in high temperature, turbulent, and corrosive gas environments.  The microsensor array will be sufficiently low cost that it can be expendable and can transmit data from regions where it is impractical to retrieve instrumentation.  This innovative use of a low cost microsensor array can provide measurements not feasible with more expensive and sophisticated instruments which cannot be sacrificed in high risk measurement areas.	14213

STARwatch to Deliver Objective Sleep Measures for Spaceflight Operations, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	This project will achieve a wrist-worn actigraphy device called STARwatch, designed specifically for space exploration environments. It will provide a minimally obtrusive, objective measure that evaluates astronaut sleep-wake activity and light exposure. This project will leverage our second generation actigraphy device that has already been validated in controlled laboratory experiments against gold-standard polysomnography. The compact wrist-worn device includes sensors to collect sleep metrics and will also serve as a wireless hub to collect real-time physiological data from other body-worn sensors (e.g., heart rate, EEG). It will use standardized wireless communication protocols (e.g., xxxxxx) to automatically uplink data to the xxxxxx network (no astronaut time required). xxxxxx will automatically be integrated into medical operations support systems (e.g., BHP-Dashboard) to provide immediate feedback to astronauts and flight surgeons to aid in decision-making relative to astronaut medical, behavioral health and performance issues. During xxxxxx I, we will develop an enhanced STARwatch, integrate data from other body worn sensors (e.g., heart rate sensor), demonstrate automatic data streaming using approaches compatible with the xxxxxx network environment, and develop a plan for operational validation and spaceflight certification that will be implemented during xxxxxx (xxxxxx I xxxxxx of 4-5).	14215
Printed Ultra-High Temperature NDE Sensors for Complex Structures, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx I xxxxxx proposal will address the use of innovative additive manufacturing technologies applicable to Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) and xxxxxx (SHM) strain and temperature sensors at ultra-high temperatures up to 1000 C. Technologies are required that enable flaw detection on atmospheric and space flight vehicles during deep space missions, hypersonic flight and reentry in harsh environments including high temperatures, combustion, high vacuum, high pressure, vibration, turbulence and cryogenic space conditions. xxxxxx strain gage readout at high and varying temperatures also requires temperature sensing for calibration. The prior art technologies of making strain gages and thermocouples have distinct limitations in direct application/integration to large 3D parts, cost, weight/resolution/feature size and operation to high temperatures. Direct-write printing has established itself as an enabling technology for production of both circuits and sensors on 3D and flexible surfaces that could not otherwise be fabricated with conventional techniques. This project will develop the specialized inks and deposition techniques necessary to implement additive manufacturing of hardened ultra-high temperature, lightweight strain gages and thermocouples with low profiles suitable for thin components. xxxxxx integrated and modular sensors and arrays can be implemented for NDE and SHM of complex parts and hard-to-address locations that were previously out-of-bounds. Hardened inks may be applied by a variety of additive manufacturing techniques directly onto three-dimensional components or on high temperature substrates that can be adhered to complex components by refractory joining. High temperature stable strain gages will be proven feasible in xxxxxx I to a xxxxxx Readiness xxxxxx of at least 3. xxxxxx work on readout technology will focus on wireless techniques to take data remotely at high temperatures and on embedded components.	14216
Multi-channel tunable source for atomic sensors, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx I xxxxxx will establish the feasibility of developing compact, robust, integrated components suitable for atomic interferometry.  xxxxxxR's design is enabled by capitalizing on robust, well-commercialized, low-noise telecom components with high reliability and declining costs which will help to drive the widespread deployment of this system.  The key innovation is the combination of current telecom-based fiber laser and modulator technology with periodically-poled waveguide technology to produce tunable laser light at rubidium D1 and D2 wavelengths (and expandable to other alkalis) using second harmonic generation (SHG).  With this technology, multiple channels can be independently tuned to produce the fields needed for addressing atomic states in atom interferometers and clocks.  In addition, this technology could be useful in the development cold-atom inertial sensors and gyroscopes.	14217

In the proposed innovation high toughness 580 KSI (4000 MPa) steel wires woven in net shape will be used. Wire counts are proportional to transverse and longitudinal stresses and a polymer covers the net. The ends are uniquely overlapped to preserve maximum strength.  Cost is substantially low.	14219

The device will automatically provide continuous and on-demand maintenance of xxxxxx ion biocide levels in spacecraft water streams and storage tanks, as well as providing output data for silver concentrations and a profile of total silver added to the system over time. Considerable test work is planned under the AES program and, given silver ion's 'elusiveness' in water systems, the data will be far more reliable if the methodology for adding the biocide and measuring its concentration is performed by a reliable and flight-qualifiable design from the beginning. The xxxxxx I Technical xxxxxxs are to develop the device specifications, software and hardware to conform to spacecraft applications as specified by xxxxxx. The specific objectives will be to 1) develop a complete analytical characterization of the detection method, inclusive of automated autocalibration and QA/QC functions, 2) demonstrate the Feedback Control Function to maintain consistent xxxxxx ion concentration in active water systems, and 3) determine the operating parameters required to generate xxxxxx in the ranges of 0.05-40 mg/l in potable water.xxxxxx I will culminate in a complete analytical methodology and a flight preproduction prototype for measurement and control of silver ion at sub-ppb levels in finished waters.	14220

Particle Flow Physics Modeling for Extreme Environments, Phase II	2017-01-01	2018-07-19	"The liberation of particles induced by rocket plume flow from spacecraft landing on unprepared regolith of the xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and other destinations poses high mission risks for robotic and human exploration activities. This process occurs in a combination of \"extreme environments\" that combine low gravity, little or no atmosphere, rocket exhaust gas flow that is supersonic and partially rarefied, and unusual geological and mechanical properties of highly irregular surface regolith. CFDRC and the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx will deliver unique plume driven erosion simulation software for such environments by combining novel granular physics simulation modules developed by UF with multi-phase gas-granular flow simulation software developed by CFDRC. Granular flow constitutive models, formulated through first-principle 3-D xxxxxx Element xxxxxx particle kinetics and implemented in an efficient xxxxxxian gas-granular flow solver are the foundation of this software. The fidelity of these simulations will be advanced towards simulating particle compositions with broad shape and size variations. Novel particle kinetics modeling concepts will be applied to formulate granular flow physics models for both, realistic irregular particle shapes and dispersed particle size distributions. xxxxxx I demonstrated the successful implementation and validation of irregular granular shape physics modeling in CFDRC's gas-granular multi-phase flow solver. An approach for extension to poly-disperse particle mixture simulations was also developed. Full integration of these models in xxxxxx will enable the simulation of gas flow interaction with poly-disperse, irregular shaped particle materials. Extensive verification, validation, and application demonstrations will be performed. The proposed technology development will result in unprecedented computer modeling capability for predicting liberation and flow of realistic granular material compositions in extreme extra-terrestrial environments."	14224
Second International Diagnostic Competition - DXC'10	2010-11-05	2018-07-19	A framework to compare and evaluate diagnosis algorithms (DAs) has been created jointly by xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx, xxxxxx xxxxxx, and Delft xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx. In this paper, we present the second implementation of this framework in a competition called DXC’10. The overall goal of this competition is to evaluate the performance of different diagnostic methods.  In order to accurately mimic diagnostic technology use in a real-world context, we have defined diagnostic problems driven by use cases representing different roles of diagnosis results. In the end, the competition pitted seven DAs competing in two diagnostic problems. The paper presents the systems used in DXC’10, a description of faults and data sets used for each diagnostic problem, a listing of participating DAs, the performance metrics and results computed from running the DAs with the framework, and an analysis of the results.	14225
Modeling of an Adjustable Beam Solid State Light	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	This proposal is for the development of a computational model of a prototype variable beam light source using optical modeling software, Zemax xxxxxxicStudio &reg;. The variable beam light source&nbsp;will be designed to generate flood, spot, and directional beam patterns, while maintaining the same average power usage.&nbsp; The optical model&nbsp;will demonstrate the possibility of such a light source and its ability to address several issues:&nbsp; commonality of design, human task variability, and light source design process improvements.&nbsp; An adaptive lighting solution that utilizes the same electronics footprint and power constraints while addressing variability of lighting needed for the range of exploration tasks&nbsp;can save costs and allow the development of common avionics for lighting controls.&nbsp; One of the risks of a multi-system approach to reaching xxxxxx is the cost added due to unique designs driven by the use cases of each operational platform.&nbsp; The risk in developing a lighting solution for one platform, is that its design may not fully address the variability of tasks for other platforms, and due to vehicle time development scale, may become obsolete by the time the last vehicle component is developed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the rigorous and expensive certification process for electronic hardware, it would be wise to develop lighting system components and control technologies that are modular and adaptive to a wide range of internal and external vehicle tasks.&nbsp; The introduction of&nbsp;the concept of computer based modeling of light sources prior to fabrication is a process improvement for spacecraft lighting design and its demonstration&nbsp;can show cost savings potential for the development of future lighting systems.&nbsp;This project will use the lighting and optical modeling software, Zemax xxxxxxicStudio &reg;&nbsp;Premium, to build a model of an LED array.&nbsp; Zemax is a forward ray tracer that can model light source beam distribution, light source spectral wavelength, and material reflectance / transmittance properties.&nbsp; It can predict final beam distribution based on the designed optical system.&nbsp; Each LED in the array developed will represent currently manufactured LEDs intended for white light illumination.&nbsp; The light output of the LEDs will be controlled individually, while maintaining the same total flux output.&nbsp; The goal is to develop beam pattern distributions, from the same source that represent flood, spot, and directional lighting while consuming approximately the same power.&nbsp;The deliverable will be a Zemax computational lighting model that can be interpreted, as a future project, into an end item specification for a variable beam light source.&nbsp; The computation model will show the type and number of LEDs, LED spacing, intensity of the LEDs used to generate each beam pattern, and constraints on diffuser optics.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the computational model, Illumination xxxxxxing Society (IES) beam pattern files for each beam type will be published.&nbsp;&nbsp; Beam pattern data will be interpreted for potential application in an installation as it relates to human task performance.	14226

Superconducting Vias for High Performance Microwave Applications	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	We will develop superconducting vias for use as bridge crossovers with a novel planar sacrificial MEMS (xxxxxx-xxxxxx-Mechanical xxxxxxs) process.&nbsp; The resulting circuit structures will be impedance matched and applicable for use below the superconducting gap frequency commonly in use in planar transmission line circuits. An ultra-broadband air-gap low-parasitic superconducting crossover circuit be optimized, prototyped, and cryogenically&nbsp; evaluated. We will also explore a innovative via-less design concept based on a 4-port symmetric planar junction.	14228

Highly Efficient FUV Photodetector with AlGaN Nanowire Photocathode, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	To address the xxxxxx GSFC need for significant improvements in wide bandgap materials and detectors for UV applications, xxxxxxical xxxxxxics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new xxxxxx xxxxxx Plate solar-blind photodetector with an Alxxxxxx nanowire photocathode fabricated directly on the MCP entrance plane (NW-Si-MCP). This innovative photocathode and the technology of its growth on the Si microchannel plate enables us to meet xxxxxx requirements for high quantum efficiency, low noise, radiation-hard, reliable, and potentially low cost solar-blind photodetectors. The large size and high number of microchannels offers superior spectral and spatial resolution for future xxxxxx space instruments involved in the investigation of the origin of xxxxxx, planet finding, and understanding xxxxxx-Earth interactions while simultaneously improving the sensitivity of new instruments and avoiding an expensive increase of their cost due to optical system size. In xxxxxx I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of fabrication of Alxxxxxx nanowire photocathodes for NW-Si-MCP detectors by fabricating the photocathode samples and demonstrating their quantum efficiency in the spectral range from 100 nm to 200 nm (xxxxxx level 4). In xxxxxx, POC plans to develop a fully functional NW-Si-MCP prototype and demonstrate its long-term operation in harsh conditions (xxxxxx level 6).	14230

A phase-space coupled hybrid framework for combined continuum/rarefied high speed flows	2018-10-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxxy Career Faculty Award will support the development of a novel phase-space coupled hybrid framework for mixed continuum/rarefied flows. Flow structures that develop around high-speed atmospheric entry vehicles often contain localized flow regions where rarefied (or non-continuum) effects, within an otherwise continuum description, lead to significant modeling uncertainty. Hybrid techniques that incorporate both continuum and kinetic computational methodologies offer an elegant balance of computational efficiency and accuracy for simulations involving mixed continuum/rarefied flow regimes. These efforts will construct a foundational hybrid framework for chemically reacting flows from xxxxxxralized Chapman-Enskog (GCE) Theory. Broad research opportunities exist in the development of this hybrid methodology, and a number of novel contributions are anticipated from these efforts including: (i) consistent state-based kinetics models for CFD/xxxxxx flow solvers, (ii) new set of GCE continuum breakdown parameters and assessment of continuum breakdown for reacting flows, (iii) a novel phase-space coupling procedure for improved statistics in xxxxxx tail-driven processes.	14235
Targeting Absolute Salinity for Earth and Space	2013-06-01	2018-07-19	As part of a grant through a xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx (JSC) 2011 xxxxxxovation Charge Account (ICA), a novel optical sensor was developed and early feasibility demonstrated in the measurement of concentration factors in spacecraft urine and urine brine waste streams.&nbsp; As part of this development work, a secondary xxxxxxbased application for the sensor was suggested.&nbsp; Specifically, the optical sensor might be used to predict so-called &ldquo;absolute&quot; salinity, a new salinity parameter believed critical for improved&nbsp;modeling of the ocean&#39;s thermodynamic processes and better predicting global climate change. For both applications, the need to improve the sensor&#39;s measurement sensitivity was recognized.&nbsp; The current project investigated methods to improve measurement sensitivity over the 2011 developed ICA optical sensor.&nbsp; Interim results suggest up to at least a 20-fold increase in waveguide&nbsp;response can be achieved using a novel design and construction of a hybrid waveguide sensor.&nbsp; The continued development of an optical sensor platform capable of enhanced measurements of solution concentration is certain to find use in a broad range of important Earth and space applications. As part of a 2011 JSC xxxxxxovation Charge Account (ICA) call, a novel in-line optical sensor was developed and early feasibility demonstrated in the measurement of concentration factors in spacecraft urine/urine brine samples using a novel optical waveguide sensor.&nbsp; During the course of the 2011 work, a second application of the waveguide sensor was realized.&nbsp; Specifically, it was conceived that the optical sensor could be packaged and used for in-situ estimates of so-called &quot;absolute&quot; salinity.&nbsp; This salinity parameter is being suggested as a potential new standard for modeling the ocean&#39;s thermodynamic processes and better predicting global climate change.&nbsp; For both applications, it was recognized that the sensitivity of the 2011 ICA sensor would need to be improved. The current project proposed the investigation of methods to improve the sensitivity of&nbsp;the optical sensor, by way of parameters such as: the physical dimensions of the system, use of alternative waveguide materials, light sources and light conditioning, and treatments to fiber optic waveguide materials.&nbsp; Interim results have demonstrated at least a 20-fold increase in sensitivity over&nbsp; the concentration range of interest using a novel design and construction of a hybridized waveguide system.&nbsp; A xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx describing the sensor has been submitted, MSC-25706-1.&nbsp;	14236

Hydrophobic Polymers with Adherend Complexing Sidechains as Durable Aerospace Adhesives, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	In support of xxxxxx Aeronautics xxxxxxearch Mission Directorate, xxxxxxSonic would optimize our moisture-resistant aerospace adhesives with in-situ corrosion mitigating surface treatments to improve aviation safety by reducing durability related hazards on subsonic commercial aircraft.  xxxxxxSonic specializes in the production of advanced, non-commodity resins as adhesive, sealant, and novel coupling agents.  One aspect of our synthetic method involves the systematic replacement of nonpolar groups along well defined polymer backbones with sidechain chemical moieties capable of complexing with metals, hence significantly increasing adhesion to metal or composites relative to nonpolar resins.  xxxxxx engineered hybrid copolymers allow the inherently hydrophobic backbone to mitigate moisture ingress, while the tailored sidechain moieties offer adhesion orders of magnitude greater than unmodified commodity resins.  xxxxxxSonic also tailors the number and type of crosslinking sites available to minimize CTE, while maximizing the mechanical properties and cohesive strength to prevent catastrophic disbonding from aircraft adherend. The specialty adhesives are available in 1-55 gallon drum quantities.  Down-selected adhesives and coupling agents shall be tested under harsh thermal (-90ºF to 800ºF) and environmental conditions and in a wind tunnel (subsonic, xxxxxx <1) along-side state-of-the-art structural aerospace adhesives to increase the xxxxxx from 4 to 6 during xxxxxx	14238
Nanoparticle-Dendrimer Composite Ultralight Photovoltaics, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop flexible solid state polymer-based solar cells that have a power density >1000 W/kg and > 5 year life in the space environment. The specific approach that we will employ it to make intimate organic-inorganic nanocomposites of polymeric electron donors and low-percolating nanoparticle electron acceptors. The polymeric donors have a novel hyperbranched structure which ensure a three dimensional network with high isotropic charge mobility. The high aspect ratio nanoparticle acceptors have a high intrinsic mobility and low percolation threshold. Materials are modified chemically to form intimate interpenetrating networks. The cells are formed by laminating the composite between high and low work function contacts disposed on space-qualified flexible polymer substrates. xxxxxx I entails demonstrating cells with >2% xxxxxx efficiency using this approach.	14239

A First Response Crew Mask for Ammonia, Hydrazine and Combustion Products, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	The increasing frequency of xxxxxx (xxxxxx) egress operations results in chemical contamination of the spacecraft environment.  Among the most important contaminants are propellant residues (such as hydrazine) and their decomposition by-products, as well as coolants such as ammonia and xxxxxx.  xxxxxx has a 24 hour xxxxxx xxxxxximum Allowable Concentration (SMAC) of 7 ppm (Perry, 2010) and hydrazine has a 24 hour SMAC of 0.3 ppm (xxxxxx/JSC 20584, xxxxxxh, 2001).  These highly alkaline chemicals rapidly penetrate skin and coagulate proteins.  Furthermore, a hydrazine fuel leak onto any hot surfaces may cause fire.  TDA xxxxxxearch xxxxxx. proposes to develop a new adsorbent that can remove these contaminants to sub ppmv concentrations.  In the xxxxxx I, we will develop the adsorbent media and design a cartridge that will be incorporated into a first response crew mask.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of the cartridge in removing these contaminants at full-scale in an environmental chamber (xxxxxx 4).  We will also complete the detailed design of a general purpose first response mask, including additional adsorbents and ambient temperature oxidation catalyst that will provide complete protection against all contaminants (in addition to xxxxxx and hydrazine, CO, volatile organic compounds and combustion by-products, such as sulfur oxides will all be removed).  In xxxxxx, we will work with Gentex, a leading supplier of personal protection systems in fabricating the mask and cartridges. We will complete high fidelity demonstrations in an environmental chamber to fully demonstrate its capability (non-human testing at xxxxxx 6).	14243
Multi-Agent Optical Sensor Chip for Cryogenic Fluids Leak Detection, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	In space missions, launch vehicles (LV) are filled with cryogenic propellant fluids. It is important to protect these LVs from any leakage of liquid propellants through a reliable, accurate, leak detection system.  Currently used analytical methods do not meet space mission requirements of low power consumption, reliability, low weight, and cost effectiveness. To overcome these limitations, Intelligent xxxxxxical xxxxxxs (IOS) proposes to adapt, optimize, and integrate optical detection technologies into an accurate leak detection system for H2, O2, and xxxxxx.Due to their extreme low temperatures, these cryogenic fluids induce a contraction of the materials they contact, creating a potential cause of leakage. xxxxxx leakage in air creates an explosive atmosphere for hydrogen concentrations (between 4% (v/v) -- the lower explosive limit (LEL) and 74.5% (v/v) -- the upper explosive limit (UEL)) at room temperature and pressure. The early detection of cryogenic fluid leakage is extremely important for reasons of safety, reliability, and economy. IOS will provide its expertise in optical sensing to develop a miniaturized, reliable, highly sensitive, multi agent detection prototype, a xxxxxx-Agent xxxxxxical xxxxxx xxxxxx for xxxxxxgenic Fluids xxxxxx xxxxxxion (MOSCLD). The study will target detection limits of 1ppm or less and a response time in the millisecond range.	14244
Stochastic Queuing Model Analysis to Support Airspace Super Density Operations (ASDO), Phase II	2013-05-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx has been involved in extensive research efforts to develop advanced concepts and technologies, for the Next xxxxxxration Air Transportation xxxxxx (xxxxxx) under different xxxxxxearch Focus Areas (RFAs). The Airspace Super Density Operations (ASDO) RFA seeks to develop efficient terminal area operations. It is expected that multiple ASDO concepts will be interacting with one another in a complex non-deterministic manner. Therefore, the overall terminal system performance may not be a straightforward combination of individual performance indices. It is also crucial that the overall system performance be robust to wind and operational uncertainties. The proposed research effort seeks to develop a fast-time, stochastic analysis tool based on queuing theory that can be used to evaluate the interaction and combined performance of multiple ASDO concepts. The utility of the approach was demonstrated under xxxxxx I research. xxxxxx research seeks to achieve the following: (i) make enhancements to the modeling and simulation aspects of the approach, (ii) accelerate the stochastic simulation execution time using high-performance computing solutions, (iii) create software plug-ins for existing xxxxxx research tools, (iv) conduct studies of xxxxxx terminal area concepts using the queuing simulation, and (v) develop a conflict free scheduling algorithm based on the queuing simulation.	14245

A guideline on the feasibility of these  sensors will be established based on the proposed study. Upon successful validation, the proposed advanced sensors may potentially be utilized for monitoring and control applications for xxxxxx/JPL projects such as xxxxxx, missions with EDL capability, as well as integration into dynamics testing procedures at JPL such as random vibration, acoustics, and shock."	14246

A Quantum Cascade Laser-Based CO Sensor for Fire Warning, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxion Technologies and xxxxxxical xxxxxxs xxxxxx. (PSI) propose to jointly develop a compact, rugged, highly reliable, and autonomous sensor for in-situ monitoring of CO in spacecraft crew areas for fire warning.  Our innovation is to combine a custom fabricated Quantum Cascade xxxxxx (QCL) with PSI's proprietary single board electronics package that incorporates both a high sensitivity optical detection technique and all system control functions, to create a laser spectrometer for CO.  The advent of QCLs enables the development of a very compact and highly sensitive monitor.  This technical approach will result in a sensor that has the requisite dynamic range of 1 to 500 ppmv with a precision of 1 ppmv CO, in a physically robust and compact package.  The xxxxxx I program will demonstrate the feasibility of a breadboard sensor and create a detailed conceptual design for an advanced prototype.  The xxxxxx at the beginning of xxxxxx I is level 2 and the xxxxxx at the end of xxxxxx I will be level 4.  xxxxxx program will fabricate a prototype that can be demonstrated at a relevant simulator.  The xxxxxx at the end of xxxxxx will be level 6.  Successful completion of xxxxxx I and II will result in a rigorously validated prototype sensor that can monitor ambient CO with high speed and precision.  The sensor architecture can be easily modified to measure other species.	14249
High Seed Compressor for Propellant Densification, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Propellant densification systems particularly for H2 require compression systems developing very large amounts of head.  xxxxxxment of this head requires multiple stages of compressors running at high speed.  In the past these compressors have run on grease-packed ball bearings with very limited life.  This project will utilize special foil bearings in place of the ball bearings and not only greatly increase bearing life but also permit even higher speed operation which will reduce the number of compression stages and increase system efficiency.	14250
Compact, High-Accuracy Oxygen Flow Meter, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	Life support systems for future space suits will require advanced instrumentation to enable use of the suit for multiple missions.

In xxxxxx I, we will prove the feasibility of our approach through analyses and trade-off studies, proof-of-concept demonstrations, and prototype design.  In xxxxxx, we will design and assemble prototype flow meters and measure their performance under conditions that simulate operation in a portable life support system.	14251
Optical Coating Degradation Due to Particle Impacts	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	Charged particles are an important source of contamination for laser transmitter optics. xxxxxxver, these effects are not currently included in the GSFC contamination model, a deficiency that could result in compromising entire space missions. We will develop an all-purpose model to evaluate and mitigate the risk of laser contamination from charged particles, an accomplishment that will provide GSFC with a competitive advantage in future proposals, in particular for many of the missions in the xxxxxx xxxxxx Decadal Survey. With so many missions relying on well-functioning lasers, the evaluation and mitigation of charged particle contamination to laser optics is clearly of immense importance. Furthermore, xxxxxx with its diverse cadre of experts covering all relevant aspects of this problem is perfectly positioned to develop the machinery to evaluate and mitigate this serious threat to mission success.The motivation for this IRAD proposal is the three year long xxxxxx instrument xxxxxxical Coatings Life Test (Oxxxxxx) that addressed molecular contamination, but only in the laboratory - not in the space environment. xxxxxx of the Oxxxxxx measurements and telemetric data from previous xxxxxx xxxxxx missions including ICESat/GLASS and LRO/LOLA have revealed degradation in the optical throughput of the xxxxxx Transmitter (LT) optics (but not the laser itself) and significantly greater laser beam divergence. The combination of these two effects resulted in a significant reduction in LT performance. This level of reduction is significantly greater than the predictions of the xxxxxx molecular contamination model for the LT optics: it predicts only a 1.4% degradation for the xxxxxx LT optics. Furthermore, the Oxxxxxx-based LT optics life predictions for laser assisted molecular hydrocarbon contamination may not completely explain the level of LT optics performance degradation experienced by previous xxxxxx xxxxxx missions. Because the xxxxxx development is currently in the xxxxxxtion and xxxxxx stage, it is too far along to accommodate this proposed research within the ATLAS xxxxxxent budget and schedule or to modify the ATLAS LT design based on the results of the proposed modeling tool.This IRAD will develop a completely new modeling capability for use as a design tool for any future xxxxxx mission that includes a xxxxxx. This capability has the potential to significantly extend the operational life of LT optics (assuming the other instrument subsystems continue to function nominally) by reducing contamination-related risk. This will result in both cost savings and improved data quality.	14252

Time Domain Terahertz Axial Computed Tomography Non Destructive Evaluation, Phase II	2012-04-01	2018-07-19	"In this xxxxxx 2 project, we propose to develop, construct, and deliver to xxxxxx a computed axial tomography time-domain terahertz (CT TD-THz) non destructive evaluation (NDE) system which will provide true three dimensional images of aerospace polymer, ceramic, and composite structures.   Traditional time domain terahertz reflection tomographic imaging captures only a single view of an object, generating images of laminar structure similar to an ultrasound \"B-Scan\".  This reflection tomographic imaging is limited, however, in revealing only the laminar structure which presents a clear specular reflection from each interface.  Furthermore, traditional time domain terahertz reflection tomographic imaging has substantial difficulty in determining the layer index of refraction an absorption properties without ambiguity.   In xxxxxx we demonstrated the feasibility TD-THz  axial computed tomography to generate cross-sectional slices of aerospace materials.  This method acquires not one view, but many radial axial views, generating a sinogram which can be used to reconstruct images using a derivative of standard xxxxxx filtered back-projection.  The sinogram can be generated by the transmission absorbance, transmission time of flight, and, in principle, reflection measurements.  The reconstructed TD-THz CT images are 3D maps of the absorption coefficients and/or the index of refraction of the subsurface material."	14254

Passive, Failure-Tolerant Docking and Undocking with Articulated Magnets	2019-08-01	2018-07-19	Current spacecraft docking relies on active movement (e.g. thrusters) to close the gap between participants, and to separate them when undocking. I intend to develop a universal, passive docking system using articulated permanent magnets to produce variable magnetic fields. By manipulating the configuration of permanent magnets, the net field at a point far away from the array can be altered. This allows spacecraft to approach each other by far-field magnetic attraction, with a guaranteed limit on potential energy so as to minimize the risk of collision.I intend to progress to xxxxxx 3 or higher under this fellowship through these three objectives:1. I intend to characterize the effect magnetic field manipulation has on collisions between parent systems. My investigation will begin with the special case of two objects approaching each other on a frictionless plane. I will conduct experiments such as tracking permanent magnets approaching each other on an air table. After investigating the case of static magnetic fields, I will create test platforms to produce variable fields during their approach. These robots can be constructed with simple permanent magnets and other off-the-shelf parts.2. Next I will select sensors so that the robots can characterize the state of their approach. These will be proven, high-xxxxxx solutions, integrated with my low-xxxxxx work to create a proof-of-concept suitable for testing in a laboratory environment. By closing the loop around the system, I will make it possible to design a control algorithm to adjust the configuration of the magnets to facilitate attraction or repulsion as needed to produce docking behavior.3. Ultimately, I intend to demonstrate the two robots approaching and coupling with each other and targets. By modulating the arrays of one or more units I will make sure they approach each other correctly. The robots should be able to establish a grapple on command, coupling with similar sized targets or visiting arbitrary points on larger ones. This will require access to sizable frictionless facilities such as those available at xxxxxx and other xxxxxx research centers.This project is highly relevant to TAxxxxxx, which includes development of docking systems applicable to a wide range of missions. My work will provide a fail-safe method of facilitating autonomous interactivity at all scales. It is low xxxxxx because no proof-of-concept yet exists although the physics of magnetism are well understood. Therefore I believe this work is well suited to the NSTRF solicitation for low xxxxxx technology development, relevant to xxxxxx. It is relevant to xxxxxx interests in general because of the alternative it offers to traditional docking mechanisms.With permanent magnets, attraction or repulsion can be maintained with power only needed for adjustments instead of continuously to generate the field. This solution provides the versatility of electromagnets with the power benefits of permanent magnets. It also simplifies the docking process by sharing a single hardware package for maneuvering during approach and securing the connection. Another major benefit is that targets do not need to be cooperative or even compliant with capture attempts. This enables a variety of future mission capability in Earth orbit and beyond.	14256

These tests were performed on uniformly loaded flat thrust bearing style test plates.xxxxxx effort will take this information and use it in a real world application, existing advanced planetary exploration suit's bearings. Specifically focusing on the Z-1 series suit's Hip and Waist, and also the Z-2 Series Hip bearings. These are areas that are known to have large contact stresses due to non-uniform loading through axial restraint lines. This loading yields increased stresses in different areas of the race. With an understanding of the max expected stress, the bearing design can be made to accommodate all contact stresses applied to the race.xxxxxx effort will consist of finding the maximum expected contact stresses in these bearings through both test and FEA simulation. The bearing designs can then be optimized to reduce the contact stresses in these areas. Air-Lock will manufacture DVT units in order to cycle test the optimized bearings. The task will be finalized with the delivery of optimized bearings capable of being used on the Z-1 Series and Z-2 Series suits.	14258

Spinning-Scroll Pump for Cryogenic Feed System, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	The innovation is an efficient, compact, lightweight, reliable, electric-driven, cryogenic spinning scroll pump (CSSP) capable of pumping liquid methane or oxygen at flows of 8-10 lbm/s. The pump will satisfy propulsion feed system needs stated in xxxxxx xxxxxxearch Topic Z10.02: xxxxxx In-xxxxxx Propulsion. The primary goal is to develop a versatile CSSP, capable of pumping liquid or two-phase methane or oxygen at a wide range of speeds (i.e. 1,000-8,000 xxxxxx) and a wide range of differential pressures while maintaining high reliability and a compact size.For xxxxxxgenic pumping, state of the art (SOA), consists of two vastly different technology options. Centrifugal turbopumps and positive displacement pumps. xxxxxxpumps utilize an impeller-inducer combination that relies on high impeller speeds to create a differential pressure. While the high-speed operation makes turbopumps more compact, it also limits bearing life, differential pressure, and they can't handle two-phase flow. Positive displacement pumps can handle larger pressure differentials and don't have issues with two-phase flow. xxxxxxver, they can't achieve speeds over 3,000 xxxxxx without bulky and high-load bearings. This typically makes positive displacement pumps larger, and consequently, less desirable for aerospace applications.The CSSP offers the best of both options. As a positive displacement pump, it can achieve high-pressure with minimal reduction in flow and pump saturated liquids at low net-positive suction heads. Due to the spinning motion of the pump various centrifugal loads are eliminated, with reduced loading, speeds over 8,000 xxxxxx are possible, making the design compact and lightweight. Additionally, the spinning motion of the scrolls eliminates the need for a counterbalance common in orbiting scroll designs. This further reduces weight by eliminating counterweights and eases bearing loads. Air Squared believes the proposed CSSP is a perfect fit in support of xxxxxx Propulsion.	14268

A multi-feature integration method for fatigue crack detection and crack length estimation in riveted lap joints using Lamb waves	2013-12-12	2018-07-19	This paper presents an experimental study of damage detection and quantification in riveted lap joints. Embedded lead zirconate titanate piezoelectric (PZT) ceramic wafer-type sensors are employed to perform in situ non-destructive evaluation (NDE) during fatigue cyclical loading. PZT wafers are used to monitor the wave reflection from the boundaries of the fatigue crack at the edge of bolt joints. The group velocity of the guided wave is calculated to select a proper time window in which the received signal contains the damage information. It is found that the fatigue crack lengths are correlated with three main features of the signal, i.e., correlation coefficient, amplitude change, and phase change. It was also observed that a single feature cannot be used to quantify the damage among different specimens since a considerable variability was observed in the response from different specimens. A multi-feature integration method based on a second-order multivariate regression analysis is proposed for the prediction of fatigue crack lengths using sensor measurements. The model parameters are obtained using training datasets from five specimens. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated using several lap joint specimens from different manufactures and under different loading conditions.	14282

Active Collision Avoidance for Planetary Landers	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	Present day robotic missions to other planets require precise, a priori knowledge of the terrain to pre-determine a landing spot that is safe. xxxxxxding sites can be miles from the mission objective, or, mission objectives may be tailored to suit landing sites. Future robotic exploration missions should be capable of autonomously identifying a safe landing target within a specified target area selected by mission requirements. Such autonomous landing systems must (1) &lsquo;see&rsquo; the surface, (2) identify a target, and (3) land the vehicle.&nbsp; Recent advances in radar technology have resulted in small, lightweight, low power radars that are used for collision avoidance and cruise control systems in automobiles. Such radar systems can be adapted for use as active hazard avoidance systems for planetary landers. The focus of this CIF proposal is to leverage earlier work on collision avoidance systems for MSFC&rsquo;s Mighty Eagle lander and evaluate the use of automotive radar systems for collision avoidance in planetary landers. xxxxxxancements in radar technology have resulted in commercial, automotive collision avoidance radars. These radar systems typically use 37GHz or 77GHz interferometry to identify hazards around a vehicle. This is done by developing a high-resolution &lsquo;topographic&rsquo; map of the area surrounding the vehicle and identifying potential changes in the surrounding area. &nbsp;The technology should not be confused with older radar systems, which do not use interferometry. Automotive interferometric systems are designed to be lightweight, consume little electric power, and are small enough to fit into fenders of vehicles.These systems have enormous potential in performing the same functions for planetary landers.&nbsp; Compared to systems dependent on optical wavelengths, suspended dust, small particles and aerosols are transparent to radar&rsquo;s much longer wavelengths. &nbsp;The automotive collision avoidance systems are not inhibited by dust clouds as are optical systems, are relatively small, and do not consume much power &ndash; three key characteristics that make them good candidates for a collision avoidance system.xxxxxx systems, from vendors like xxxxxx Automotive, are available with the full complement of hardware, processing software and visualization systems. We emphasize the importance of the existing software base.&nbsp; Replicating the investment represented by these packages is prohibitive. Freescale Semiconductors, an industry leader in advanced integrated circuits, have recently announced the availability of a single chip automotive radar solution at different frequencies. These single-chip solutions are state-of-the-art technologies that integrate the entire front-end of a radar system into a single surface mount device, that occupies less that 1 sq. cm. This product significantly miniaturizes a potential collision avoidance system.&nbsp; xxxxxxver, these radars are calibrated for use in an automotive application. xxxxxx reflectivity and target detection is based on known radar cross sections for typical vehicular use.In our effort, we will evaluate a xxxxxx or similar radar solution for MSFC&rsquo;s Mighty Eagle and xxxxxx. In the first year evaluation will with a static platform. The evaluation will consist of understanding the radar signature (at automotive radar frequencies) of a simulated lunar surface and also evaluate the performance of the built-in target detection capability of a COTS radar system. In addition, we will begin evaluation of the Freescale Semiconductor solution. This will enhance our in-house capability to design and build our own system that will incorporate the knowledge gained from using the xxxxxx system in the terrain field.There are several significant elements in the evaluation.&nbsp; Here we specifically note the following to give some indication of the range and nature of the elements. (1) What interference to other spacecraft systems might happen?&nbsp; (2) How does placement on the spacecraft affect the performance of the radar? (3) What is the distance-object size-surface morphology-particle size-particle shape-particle composition detectability performance? (4) How sensitive are the tests to moisture in the simulant?&nbsp; The later point is a practical concern that must be addressed in order to evaluate the other elements. &nbsp;We are aware that rocket exhaust can interfere with radar frequencies.&nbsp; The significant of this effect at the target wavelengths with our instrument/lander geometry for an interferometric system will be evaluated.	14286
Flexure Based Electro-Magnetic Drive for High Torque Motor, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxxional xxxxxxearch Council (NRC) has identified the need for motors and actuators that can operate in extreme temperature environments as a technical gap to exploring deeper into our solar systems. Bear Technologies has been exploring motor design for more than 5 years. A number of designs are blended to create the basis of the proposed innovation. The research focuses on a fundamentally different motor design that explores the use of flexures to amplify the forces created by the electro-magnets.   In this way, the design can be much simplified, eliminates wear, free play and the need for lubricants.   Bear will focus on investigating low stress flexure designs and relatively high force electro-magnetic drives that can produce the forces needed for a high torque motor.   If proven this flexure component will be an enabling technology for the extreme environment high torque motor.	14287

Conformal Carbon Nanotubes for Stray Light Suppression	2014-10-01	2018-07-19	We have developed ultra-black CVD (chemical vapor deposition) and embedded carbon nanotube surface treatments for use in the near UV to far infrared for stray light suppression, near-ideal radiators and calibrators and detector absorbers.  We propose to develop techniques using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and electric field alignment to apply nanotubes to non-flat substrates to broaden their utilization to many additional components for space flight use.Our objective is to apply CVD and non-CVD carbon nanotubes to complex shapes that numerous scientists have requested for stray light control.  Currently, CVD nanotubes can only be grown on flat surfaces due to limitations in line-of-sight physical vapor deposition techniques such as e-beam evaporation.   For CVD our adhesion and catalyst layers must be applied on the on the component with extreme uniformity to a thickness of 1 to 2 nm for ideal performance.   Then the component must be placed in the thermal reactor furnace flow in a way that allows uniform exposure to the carbon bearing gas.  Our first focus area is to utilize atomic layer deposition (ALD) to apply our adhesion and catalyst layers conforming to the desired substrate surface.  This will allow fabrication of components that are dark on all surfaces instead of just on one surface.	14290
