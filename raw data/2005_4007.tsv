Reconfigurable/Reprogrammable Communication Systems, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	The future of reconfigurable/reprogrammable transceivers with !Y 1 xxxxxx transmission and reception data rates for future xxxxxx space communications applications will greatly depend on radiation-tolerant, high-speed and precise Digital-to-xxxxxx Converter (DAC), xxxxxx-to-xxxxxx (ADC) and digital processing devices. The present digital state-of-the-art components are limited, especially for ultra high sampling rate ADCs. Most low power ADCs are restricted to rates of about 150 Msps and 12 bits of precision. During xxxxxx I of the program, xxxxxx will research combining analog front-ends with advanced DACs, ADCs and digital processors for creating Software-xxxxxx Radio (SDR) or Cognitive Communication xxxxxx (CCT) systems. A study of MMIC low noise amplifiers, power amplifiers and up/down-converters and digital components will lead to selection of devices to be modeled for SDR/CCT design. The xxxxxx I effort will establish a baseline for a cognitive/adaptive transceiver. The final SDR/CCT design shall include a reconfigurable analog front-end and digital signal processor including a programmable frequency synthesizer for LO and digital clock generation. xxxxxx program will proceed to miniaturized fully integrated power efficient cognitive/adaptive transceivers with scalable bandwidth and digital bit precision. xxxxxxanced SDR/CCT technology will support future DoD/military/xxxxxx requirements and industrial/commercial applications for remotely reprogrammable communication systems.	14640

This portable hardware runs entertaining games that detect neurocognitive deficits and give an objective feedback to the astronaut about this decrement. This facilitates the crewmembers and flight surgeons to prescribe recommended countermeasures to the cognitive decrement.	14641
Satellite Swarm Localization and Control via Random Finite Set Statistics, Phase I	2017-06-01	2018-07-19	The proposed novel program will develop and demonstrate a new approach to perform real-time relative vehicle localization within a swarm formation with application to communication-less coordination. These objectives are achieved by using Random Finite Sets statistics theory to solve the multiple object tracking problem. The swarm formation localization problem can be formulated as estimating the local intensity function of targets in the near field and developing probabilistic control strategies to track an expected localization state space configuration. Work will focus on developing estimation and control algorithms that can utilize simple measurements range and bearing angle to other units, and also determine the local environment using feature measurements. Three major tasks are proposed for the development of swarming space vehicle estimation and control: xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and xxxxxxian Collective Decision Making. xxxxxx development in xxxxxx I will extend to a Hypothesis Density Filter and Sequential xxxxxx Hypothesis Density Filter, xxxxxx, Estimation techniques, xxxxxxdmark xxxxxx using these techniques, Behavioral xxxxxx Control, Cyclic xxxxxx Control, and multiple decision making estimation models. Proposed follow-on efforts will fully implement the swarm technology for real-time integrated system use, identify different formation configurations and sensor combination for hardware integration, and work to position the system for integration into a demonstration mission identified in the xxxxxx I work to fully illustrate the mission enhancements of the operational system.	14642

Fiber Fed Advanced Pulsed Plasma Thruster (APPT), Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	CU xxxxxx (CUA) proposes the development of the xxxxxxanced xxxxxx (Axxxxxx) that will enable cis-lunar and deep space missions for small satellites. While classic xxxxxx technology is mature, it has historically been limited by its size and propellant load to small xxxxxx-V applications. A recent advancement by CUA, Monofilament xxxxxxization Propulsion (MVP), uses extrusion 3D printing technology to provide polymer propellant to an electrothermal thruster. Axxxxxx will leverage this advancement, using PTFE fiber to allow for class-leading propellant capacity and more reliable feed than previous xxxxxx designs. Axxxxxx is inherently safe, containing no pressurants or hazardous materials, significantly reducing range safety concerns. A 1U Axxxxxx, operating at 1200 seconds xxxxxx, will provide 10,400 N-s total impulse, allowing for 1,400 m/s xxxxxx-V for an 8 kg CubeSat. xxxxxxreasing to a 2U form factor increases total impulse to 30,000 N-s, allowing for a xxxxxx-V exceeding 4 km/s. CUA anticipates delivering to xxxxxx an integrated system by the end of xxxxxx which includes the advanced thruster head, PTFE filament feed system, and an ACS subsystem.	14645

Green Applications for Space Power	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx propulsion and power for many decades has relied on xxxxxxzine monopropellant technology for auxiliary power units (APU), orbital circularization, orbit raising/lowering and attitude control.&nbsp; xxxxxxver, xxxxxxzine is toxic and therefore requires special ground handling procedures to ensure launch crew safety.&nbsp; The Swedish Company ECAPS has developed a technology based upon the propellant Ammonium Dinitramide (ADN) that offers higher performance, higher density and reduced ground handling support than xxxxxxzine.&nbsp; This blended propellant is called LMP-103S. Currently, xxxxxx Air Force (xxxxxxF) is pursuing a technology based on Hydroxyl Ammonium xxxxxx (HAN, otherwise known as AF-M315E) with industry partners xxxxxx and Moog.&nbsp; xxxxxx on the advantages offered by these propellants, MSFC should explore powering APU&rsquo;s with these propellants.Due to the availability of space hardware, the principal investigator has found a collection of xxxxxxF hardware, that will act as a surrogate, which operates on a xxxxxxzine derivative.&nbsp; The F-16 fighter jet uses H-70 or 30% diluted xxxxxxzine for an Emergency xxxxxx xxxxxx (EPU) which supplies power to the plane.&nbsp; The PI has acquired two EPU&rsquo;s from planes slated for destruction at the xxxxxx xxxxxxan AFB.This CIF will include a partnership with 2 other xxxxxx Centers who are individually seeking seed funds from their respective organizations: xxxxxx (KSC) and xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx (DFRC).&nbsp; KSC is preparing for future flights from their launch pads that will utilize green propellants and desire a low-cost testbed in which to test and calibrate new leak detection sensors.&nbsp; DFRC has access to F-16&rsquo;s which can be used by MSFC &amp; KSC to perform a ground test that demonstrates emergency power supplied to the jet.Neither of the green propellant alternatives have been considered nor evaluated for an APU application.&nbsp; Work has already been accomplished to characterize and obtain the properties of these 2 propellants.&nbsp; xxxxxxver, the spacecraft are using existing leak detection sensors that are typically used for xxxxxxzine.&nbsp; &nbsp;Using these green propellants for the APU application requires decrementing their xxxxxx down to 3.&nbsp; This task would aim to establish a xxxxxx of 4 at conclusion by showing a proof of concept with a KSC-instrumented EPU asset at the MSFC Component xxxxxxment Area (CDA). &nbsp;&nbsp;The task to accomplish this is called Green xxxxxxlication for xxxxxx xxxxxx or GRASP.&nbsp;&nbsp; A key technical difference (aside from the differences in toxicity) between xxxxxxzine and the green propellant alternatives is the combustion temperature.&nbsp; Both types of propellants are dispensed from their feed tanks through a catalyst material.&nbsp; The catalyst decomposes (reacts) with each propellant and creates the high temperature exhaust gases that are used to either provide thrust (in the application of a rocket engine) or to spin the turbine which provides power to an APU or EPU.&nbsp; xxxxxxzine decomposes at 900 deg C while the green propellants decompose at 1600 deg C.&nbsp; xxxxxxver, the existing H-70 catalyst (Shell 405) works best with dual-bonded nitrogen mixtures.&nbsp; Both ADN and HAN offer this dual-bonded feature.&nbsp; xxxxxxhough the green propellants may burn hotter with their own proprietary catalyst material, they will burn cooler with the Shell 405 product.Additionally, both propellants are mixed with water and the water content can be increased to further reduce combustion temperatures.&nbsp; For this proposal, KSC will ship their green sensors (either for ADN or HAN) to MSFC and we in turn would instrument the EPU dedicated to that propellant.&nbsp; Following completion of one month of testing the EPU instrumented with leak detection sensors, the hardware would be shipped to DFRC for a ground test inside an F-16 aircraft.&nbsp; For the chosen aircraft, the existing H-70 system would be temporarily replaced with the MSFC provided green propellant EPU and the aircraft would be suspended off the ground (jacked) to simulate an engine failure and resultant use of the EPU.&nbsp; The objective would be to show that the landing gear could be deployed and aero control surfaces would properly move to pilot commands.&nbsp;xxxxxxernative approaches to providing power to an APU include an external gas blowdown system, a Lithium Ion battery driven motor or a thermal battery driven motor.&nbsp; All of these approaches have some drawbacks.&nbsp; An external gas blowdown system may employ the use of a stored gas, most likely xxxxxx, to drive the APU turbine.&nbsp; The primary disadvantage to this system is the mass and volume required to store the compressed gas.&nbsp; A similar approach that would minimize the mass and volume is to use gaseous xxxxxx tapped off a liquid propellant rocket engine.&nbsp; xxxxxxver, APU checkouts would be problematic without the engine in operation.&nbsp; An additional system would be required to provide the gas for checkout purposes.&nbsp; In addition, future launch system elements may not have direct access to the liquid rocket engine and would require a disconnect for staging adding to its complexity.&nbsp; Lithium Ion batteries require many cells that must be matched which drive the weight and costs.&nbsp; The disadvantage of thermal batteries lies in its operation or turnaround.&nbsp; For APU checkouts, an external power source is required and in the event of a launch abort or scrub, these batteries must be replaced.&nbsp; These green propellants provide a high power density packaged power source that can be started multiple times with minimal effects on turnaround from issues presented.&nbsp; In addition, this propellant could not only provide a propellant source for APU&rsquo;s but also launch vehicle roll control.&nbsp;	14647

Improvements to the ACATS Lidar and Development of a NASA Field Campaign Concept	2017-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx profile measurements of clouds and aerosols (dust, smoke, man-made pollution) from laser remote sensing instruments, such as the xxxxxx xxxxxx-xxxxxx Transport xxxxxx (ACATS) managed at xxxxxx xxxxxx (GSFC), are desired to study the interaction of clouds and aerosols and their influence on the climate system. This project consists of the installation of a new ACATS calibration device and mechanical modifications to the ACATS receiver subsystem. These modifications will result in more accurate measurements from the instrument. In addition, this project includes preparations for GSFC-lead field campaign to study the influence of aerosols on clouds and radiaiton that will include ACATS as a payload on a xxxxxx aircraft.xxxxxx and aerosols can have numerous effects on the atmospheric radiation budget. Ice clouds cause a warming effect, while water clouds can result in a cooling effect. During cloud-free conditions, aerosols such as desert dust and smoke from biomass burning can induce a change in radiative forcing at a magnitude comparable to that of greenhouse gases but opposite the sign. Additionally, aerosol can interact with clouds, changing the radiative effects on the atmosphere. These cloud and aerosol effects on the atmospheric radiation budget remain a major uncertainty in understanding and predicting the climate system.Direct measurements of extinction vertical profiles from high spectral resolution lidars (HSRLs), such as the xxxxxx xxxxxx-xxxxxx Transport xxxxxx (ACATS) managed at xxxxxx xxxxxx (GSFC), are desired to study the interaction of clouds and aerosols and their influence on the climate system. Previous flights aboard a xxxxxx high-altitude aircraft have demonstrated the ability of ACATS to provide direct measurements of extinction for short flight segments. xxxxxxver, the performance of the instrument is impeded by poor instrument calibration. This project includes modifications to the receiver subsystem that enable implementation and testing of a calibration device for improved results.This project also supports the development of a field campaign to study the influence of aerosols on clouds and radiation. The field campaign will include the ACATS instrument and several other earth science instruments that fly on xxxxxx aircrafts, as well as a management team that primarily consists of xxxxxx and NOAA personnel.The objectives of this project are as follows:Improve the ACATS instrument calibration and overall functionality of the receiver subsystem.Ensure the ACATS instrument is ready for future flights on xxxxxx aircraft.xxxxxx the science goals and aircraft configurations for the field campaign proposal that includes the ACATS instrument and several other earth science instruments.The overall goal of this project is to have ACATS ready to participate in future field campaigns and develop the field campaign concept that will include ACATxxxxxx tasks that will be completed to achieve the objectives of project are as follows:xxxxxxte and test the new calibration device (filters, diffusers, and servo actuator assemblies) with the current receiver optics (xxxxxx #1).Oversee the design and installation of a new receiver enclosure that is both durable and meets thermal and mechanical requirements (xxxxxx #1).Test the modified system both in the lab at GSFC and on a xxxxxx aircraft (xxxxxx #2).xxxxxx the science goals and aircraft configurations for the field campaign proposal (xxxxxx #3).	14649
Atmospheric Re-entry Sensor Array for Temperature and Pressure	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	Utilizing MEMS technology, we will be able to fabricate smaller sensors that are more apt to withstand the harsh environment of the re-entry process. Therefore, sensors can be reused if necessary. Material stability during descent would allow MARSA to accurately sense pressures. Moreover, MARSA can be reused for multiple re-entries just as xxxxxxX does with the xxxxxx xxxxxx&rsquo;s heat-shield on xxxxxxX&rsquo;s xxxxxx.	14650
Single-Frequency Semiconductor Lasers Operating at 1.5 and 2.0 microns, Phase II	2011-12-01	2018-07-19	While conventional injection seeding sources (such as DFB diode lasers and rare-earth doped solid-state microchip lasers) are available at 1.5 microns, these sources typically lack the ultra-narrow (<50 kHz), ultra-stable output spectrum required for use in applications such as xxxxxx shift measurements of the tropospheric winds. Furthermore, similar sources which operate at 2.0 microns (a preferred wavelength for space-based atmospheric measurements) are simply unavailable.	14651
The Case for Software Health Management	2012-01-27	2018-07-19	Software Health Management (SWHM) is a new field that is concerned with the development of tools and technologies to enable automated detection, diagnosis, prediction, and mitigation of adverse events due to software anomalies.Significant effort has been expended in the last several decades in thedevelopment of verification and validation methods for softwareintensive systems, but it is becoming increasingly more apparent that this isnot enough to guarantee that a complex software systemmeets all safety and reliability requirements. xxxxxx software systems can exhibit a variety of failure modes which can go undetected in a verification and validation process.  While standard techniques for error handling, fault detection and isolationcan have significant benefits for many systems, it is becoming increasingly evident that new technologies and methods are necessary for the development of techniques to detect, diagnose, predict, and then mitigate the adverse events due to software that has already undergone significant verification and validation procedures.These software faults often arise due to the interaction between the softwareand the operating environment.Unanticipated environmental changes lead to software anomalies that may have significant impact on the overall success of the mission.Because software is ubiquitous, it is not sufficient that errors aredetected only after they occur. Rather, software must be instrumented andmonitored for failures before they happen.This prognostic capability will yield safer and more dependable systems for the future.  This paper addresses the motivation, needs, and requirements of software health management as a new discipline.Published in the xxxxxxeedings of the IEEE Conference on xxxxxx Mission Challenges for Information xxxxxx, xxxxxx, CA, August 2011.	14652
Understanding newly discovered oscillation modes in magnetically shielded Hall thrusters utilizing state of the art high speed diagnostics.	2020-08-01	2018-07-19	I propose to investigate the newly discovered oscillation modes specific to xxxxxxically Shied (MS) xxxxxx xxxxxxs (HET). xxxxxxhough HETs are classified as a Stationary xxxxxx (SPT), their behavior is quite dynamic once viewed under high speed time resolved diagnostics. They appear to have unstable oscillations and mode transitions that occur during a variety of operating conditions. The oscillation modes that existed in conventional unshielded (US) thrusters have been the subject of considerable research and have led to a greater understanding of the HETs dynamic behavior. For example, the US HET breathing mode has been studied using a novel High xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx probe (Hxxxxxx) and FASTCAM technology by the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx's xxxxxx and Electric Propulsion xxxxxx (PEPL) and xxxxxxs xxxxxx xxxxxx of xxxxxx xxxxxx (GRC). These studies have led to advances in HET xxxxxx, efficiency, and service lifetime.With the recent development of magnetically shielded HETs arises new physics that remain uncovered. MS HETs use modified channel geometry and a specialized magnetic fields to nearly eliminate erosion. xxxxxxver, this causes the MS HETs to behave differently and form unique oscillation modes. Recent studies performed on the 300MS-2 and H6MS HETs have revealed behavior inconsistent with US HETs. This behavior includes the presence of new mode transitions and the absence of spokes which consistently appears in US thrusters under higher magnetic field densities. Understanding and characterizing these instabilities is vital if xxxxxx is to advance HET design for very long life and high xxxxxx missions.In order to gain this understanding, I intend to develop and use state of the art high-speed diagnostic systems at GRC. GRC houses the12-kW MS xxxxxx HET, the vacuum facilities, and the actively researching HET experts necessary to complete this research. In addition to GRC, I will collaborate with xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx's PEPL laboratory.By the end of my research I hope to answer the following questions:Does the spoke instability mode exist in MS xxxxxx not, why doesn't spoke mode exist?Are there other oscillation modes unique to MS HETs?How do the oscillation modes affect thruster performance and operation?How do thruster operating parameters affect oscillation modes in MS HETs? Past studies performed on US HETs have indicated that some oscillation modes either contribute to or are necessary for proper operation. I hypothesize that the same is true for MS HETs and intend to study how this mechanism works. I've also hypothesized that spoke-like instabilities are capable within any MS HET and that the spoke mode may only appear under specific operating conditions.xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx 2 (TA-2) for In-xxxxxx Propulsion states that xxxxxx objective is to have an HET with the capability of delivering heavy payloads on 5 km/s delta-V missions. The TA-2 goals outline the need for HETs with lifetimes greater than 50,000 hours, xxxxxx's ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 seconds, and a maximum power of 10 kW. xxxxxx Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM), currently in development serves as an example of how HETs will be used in the future. The goal of the ARRM mission would be to rendezvous with a near Earth asteroid, capture it, and deliver it to lunar orbit for study. The ARRM mission would necessitate an HET with an xxxxxx in excess of 3000 seconds and propellant mass of 10,000 kg. An array of these HETs would allow a spacecraft to have a solar range of 1.9 AU. The the12-kW MS xxxxxx xxxxxx with xxxxxxic Shielding (xxxxxx) at xxxxxx xxxxxx (GRC) has been designed to fulfill this need.Upon uncovering of the newly discovered oscillation modes using state of the art high-speed diagnostics, I will publish my results and disseminate. This effort will contribute to more MS HET understanding and advances in HET life, efficiency, and thrust.	14653

Large Format LW Type-II SLS FPAs for Space Applications, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx I xxxxxx proposes to develop high performance (low dark current, high quantum efficiency, and low xxxxxx) infrared epitaxy materials based on xxxxxx II xxxxxx (SLS) for large format space-based sensor applications. The epi materials will be grown with Sb-capable multi-wafer production Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) reactor at IntelliEPI-IR.  The initial goal includes achieving QE of at least 30% with xxxxxx spectral wavelength band near 12 &#956;m.  The SLS detector design will be done in collaboration with Dr. xxxxxx infrared device group at JPL to ensure that the effort addresses xxxxxx needs.  Successful device architecture shorter wavlengths will be evolved to longer wave large-format application.  If successful, a Focal xxxxxxe Array may be fabricated during xxxxxx.	14655
Chip Integrated, Hybrid EHD/Capillary Driven Thermal Management System	2013-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx-xxxxxxted, Hybrid EHD/xxxxxxillary-Driven Thermal Management xxxxxx is a two year that will leverage independently attained yet related prototype hardware advances for electronics thermal management into a ground breaking hybrid thermal control system for spacecraft applications.xxxxxxs&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design, fabricate, and validate the chip integrated hybrid EHD/capillary device&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxxxxx the reduction in required radiator area by utilizing chip integrated thermal management system (TMS)&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fabricate and validate in thermal vacuum environment the xxxxxx xxxxxxted Hybrid EHD/xxxxxxillary TMS  The proposed research will develop novel enabling thermal management technology addressing subsystem (on-board processing and electronics thermal management) as well as spacecraft level design. The proposed validated prototype system would achieve the following engineering advantages:(1) EHD/capillary-driven thermal management system with low mass/volume and power consumption which limits the total power dissipation required of the thermal subsystem; (2) high heat transfer coefficient mechanism using thin film evaporation to maximize the heat rejection temperature and reduce the required radiator area; (3) self-regulating and smart fluid management to permit heat rejection from an arbitrary surface to the lowest available temperature sink.The current state of  the art for electronics thermal control, wherein thermal control hardware is remotely  integrated and requires relatively massive, voluminous and power consuming resources as well as large temperature differences to  serve as the driving potential transferring  dissipated heat. &nbsp;These characteristics impede  the goal of capable, efficient, and miniaturized on-board processing systems. Furthermore, processing capability is limited by thermal control considerations, such as the amount of heat rejected, the heat flux along the path of heat rejection, and the temperature difference between  the electronics components and the thermal sink. Thus, technologists seek to integrate the thermal management  solution directly into the chip layout, substrate structure, and/or package design. This will substantially  boost the cooling performance, while introducing  significant reduction in the package size, and requiring  much smaller overall system temperature driving potential: a 3-D integrated solution that is lighter, more compact, and capable of greater heat transport. In addition, a  two-phase device would provide thermal uniformity, reducing thermal stresses and thus enhancing overall component reliability.Functionally, this  concept will reduce the thermal resistance  between the chip and the radiator, raising  the heat rejection temperature with little cost  in power consumption. The net effect is to  increase the available temperature for heat rejection, presenting the spacecraft with the advantages of increased power levels and/or reduced radiator mass and volume. The prototype TMS hardware will consist of an integrated heat sink chip embedded hybrid EHD/capillary-driven fluid management device that would ensure liquid supply and system self- regulation at the evaporative surfaces.	14656

High Temperature Superconductor Resonator Detectors	2013-01-01	2018-07-19	High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) infrared detectors were studied for years but never matured sufficiently for infusion into instruments. Several recent developments support a renewal of effort: (1) xxxxxxresonator technology represents a new approach to array readout that can enable large-scale HTS bolometer arrays for xxxxxxobserving and planetary missions. (2) xxxxxx-borne passive cooling and single-stage refrigerators are now commonplace, enabling cost effective cooling to 40-80 K.There is a well-established need for more sensitive detectors in the 10 - 200 um wavelength range with high detectivity, D*>1010 cm-Hz1/2/W to increase the mapping speed for Earth and planetary science applications. LTS direct detectors with background limited performance are being widely deployed in arrays, in both space and ground-based situations (up to 104 pixels in the latter case). Megapixel array Si Blocked Impurity Band (BIB) and xxxxxx detectors are also widely used, but have a very sharp cutoff in sensitivity for >30 um. In addition, Si BIBs and LTS detectors require multi-stage refrigeration to 1000 at temperatures up to 75 K. The shift in resonance frequency under infrared irradiation, due to increasing temperature, enables each device to function as a thermometer for a separate bolometer pixel. Our current effort is directed towards achieving similar results with membrane-isolated devices by placing HTS resonators on xxxxxx membranes on Si substrates. Single transition edge sensor bolometers on xxxxxx membranes were demonstrated at JPL in 1995. We are employing an improved micromachining approach to membrane fabrication that is currently used to fabricate large arrays of resonator-based sensors based on low temperature superconductors. Our near-term goals are: (1) xxxxxxment of a suitable fabrication process, including buffer layer and superconductor deposition, microresonator and readout circuit patterning, passivation, and membrane micromachining. (2) DC and microwave device characterization versus temperature and frequency. Follow-on work will concentrate on optical characterization of working detector arrays and extension to 2D arrays.	14659
Design and Preliminary Evaluation of the r-Gamma Display Concept, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	The objective of this proposed xxxxxx I xxxxxx effort is to develop and assess the feasibility of an innovative new flight instrument proposed to replace the traditional Turn xxxxxx (or Turn-and-Slip Indicator) currently found in most general aviation (GA) aircraft.  The primary innovation is the inclusion of climb-dive information and gyroscopic heading, in addition to the turn-rate information now available, in one low-cost display.  In essence, this new ?r-xxxxxx? display concept will ?fuse? flight information on one display that the pilot must now gather and correlate from among five separate indicators whenever the aircraft experiences loss of the Attitude Indicator (AI) and the Heading Indicator (HI) due to vacuum system or gauge failure.  The innovative technology that makes this concept feasible and affordable, with a projected cost similar to that of today?s Turn xxxxxx, is derived from a technique called ?Air-xxxxxx Tracking,? recently developed and flight tested by our firm under an xxxxxx contract that involved tracking the flightpath of a small xxxxxxF sensor vehicle.  We firmly believe this concept has the potential to improve significantly the safety of emergency ?partial-panel? flight operations in GA aircraft.	14660
FIELD EXP EARTH PFES CALIBRATED RDR SPECTRUM V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	Portable Field Emission xxxxxx (PFES) data were acquired on xxxxxxy 15 and 17, 1989. A total of 31 measurements were collected for GRSFE. Of these measurements, 13 were calibrations and 18 were of representative surfaces. The data were collected primarily to support the calibration of the TIMS data and to assist in interpreting spectral mixing in the mid-infrared. Sites were selected for calibration that covered a range of emissivities. On xxxxxxy 15, PFES data were collected at Kelso Dunes and the xxxxxx xxxxxxcanic Field as part of the xxxxxx xxxxxx effort. xxxxxx and SIRIS data were collected over the same sites. For the PFES data, the Kelso Dunes xxxxxx xxxxxx site represented the silica-rich endmember and the xxxxxx basalt tephra xxxxxx site represented the more silica-poor endmember. On xxxxxxy 17, PFES data were collected at two of the modelling sites at xxxxxx (the playa and the cobble sites). Several spectra were also collected at the playa surface next to the xxxxxx thermistor site.	14661
Rodent Research-1 (RR1) NASA Validation Flight: Mouse tibialis anterior muscle transcriptomic proteomic and epigenomic data	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	xxxxxx  s xxxxxxent xxxxxxearch (RR) project is playing a critical role in advancing biomedical research on the physiological effects of space environments. Due to the limited resources for conducting biological experiments aboard xxxxxx (xxxxxx) it is imperative to use crew time efficiently while maximizing high-quality science return. xxxxxx  s xxxxxxxxxxxx project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics systems biology-based approach and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of xxxxxx DNA and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic transcriptomic and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects snap-frozen or xxxxxx-preserved and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to xxxxxxxxxxxx through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the xxxxxx Life xxxxxx xxxxxx Archive and included mouse adrenal glands quadriceps gastrocnemius tibialis anterior extensor digitorum longus soleus eye and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions and thus the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of xxxxxx crew time for rodent research activities.	14662

The OSIRIS concept was used as the starting point to determine specifications and error budgets for the instrument subsystems and to evaluate the science performance. xxxxxx technology issues were then identified to scope the study. The ability of a tensioned wire mesh to serve as a high- precision, high reflectivity and low emissivity antenna reflector surface at low frequencies is a key requirement. The emissivity must be low enough that uncertainties in the emissivity and physical temperature of the reflecting surface do not give rise to excessive thermal noise. The design of the reflector and feedhorns, and the surface shape accuracy of the reflector, must provide antenna patterns that meet the required performance for beam efficiency, gain, sidelobe levels, and cross-polarization. xxxxxx and power requirements must be kept to a minimum, and the rotational dynamics of the antenna and the attitude control requirements and capabilities of the spacecraft must be well understood. The volume of the combined antenna and spacecraft in the stowed configuration and the total mass must be within the capabilities of a low-cost launch vehicle. To address these issues, the specific objectives of the study were outlined as follows:(1) Perform a requirements analysis to validate the baseline instrument design (measurement channels, sensitivities, beam-pointing, sampling, and other system and orbital characteristics) and to assess the geophysical retrieval accuracies and allowable error budgets for the instrument subsystems&nbsp;(2) &nbsp;Perform laboratory measurements of wire mesh samples to determine their microwave emissivity, and evaluate the ability of mesh reflectors to meet the required brightness temperature precision and calibration stability(3) &nbsp;Design lightweight, multifrequency, dual-polarized feedhorns and electronics subsystems, including passive and active channels at L- and S-band frequencies, for a rotating parabolic mesh reflector system, and analyze the antenna pattern characteristics and performance(4) &nbsp;Perform an antenna and spacecraft configuration, integration, and optimization study, including deployment mechanisms, mechanical and thermal modeling, and attitude control analysis of the antenna and spacecraft system.&nbsp;	14665

Metal Digital Direct Manufacturing (MDDM) for Close-Out of Combustion Chambers and Nozzle Fabrications, Phase I	2016-06-01	2018-07-19	Use of additive manufacturing (AM) techniques are of interest as they can be used to create complex shaped rocket components in addition to the potential for multi-material, or functionally graded materials (FGM).  The main technical challenge lies in the ability to deposit various materials at relatively large diameters with the desired properties while maintaining the overall structural integrity of the assembly.  Use of interface materials can also assist in joining these very dissimilar metals ranging from Cu-based to Ni-based alloys.  In response to this need, xxxxxx, in collaboration with MSU, is proposing a xxxxxx STTR project to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the Robotic Pulsed-Arc AM process to fabricate FGM Cu-to-Ni components in support of advanced engines for the xxxxxx Launch xxxxxx (SLS) vehicle. During the xxxxxx the xxxxxx team envisions maturing the processes to AM a 21-inch diameter cooled nozzle for delivery to the xxxxxx for machining and preparation for hot fire testing by the xxxxxx.	14667
COAST Map Sharing Plugin, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	We propose the development of a capability which will allow ecosystem managers to share a map view in terms of location, magnification level, and data layers (to include local data and sources) throughout the community of COAST users. This capability will foster collaboration and allow rapid disseminate data to support operations, research, and analysis.Using a proven methodology (ref: Part 5: Related R/R&D) for gathering user requirements to drive development of appropriate solutions, the initial stage will involve collecting the task and purpose of the Environmental Managers utilizing the COAST software for determining  priorities of work to meet needs.  The creation of xxxxxx will effectively capture this information in a method that can effectively convey scientific purpose into Information xxxxxx (IT) requirements.  These documents will provide an archive of needs that the end user requires while performing their tasks.  From the xxxxxx, working prototypes will be developed as proof of technology.  These prototypes will allow ecosystem managers to provide direct feedback during the development lifecycle.The final product will be a COAST map sharing plug-in which has been defined by the ecosystem managers and refined throughout its development to ensure that it fulfills the needs of the user community.  The effect is a shorter development cycle that meets or exceeds user expectation and provides the framework for further enhancements.	14668
Reclaimable Thermally Reversible Polymers for AM Feedstock, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	CRG proposes to continue efforts from xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx I topic H5.04 Reclaimable Thermally Reversible xxxxxxs for AM Feedstock.  In xxxxxx, CRG will refine the thermally-reversible polymeric materials for function as reprocessable thermosetting matrixes, and evaluate improved reclamation and additive manufacturing (AM) related processing methods for prototype demonstrations.  These materials and processes enable reclamation and repurposing of structural fiber-reinforced composites into new configurations during extraterrestrial missions, such as conversion to xxxxxx (AM) feedstocks or direct fabrication into multipart constructs.  The thermally-reversible thermosets also present the opportunity to generate volumes of AM feedstock through function as a binder matrix, allowing compounding and impregnation/infusion of in-situ resources such as environmentally sourced metallic, mineralogical (i.e. regolith), and desized/milled non-reprocessable composites.  This approach will provide xxxxxx with a means to support in-situ resource utilization with a reduced reliance on pristine raw material payloads.  CRG has already demonstrated the efficacy of thermally-reversible polymer structures in commercial adhesive applications, as well as in previous xxxxxx technical efforts for modifying waste packaging plastics to provide improved compatibility to AM processing (xxxxxx xxxxxx H14.03-9603), and in the feasibility demonstration of the xxxxxx I effort of this project.  The proposed concept not only has the potential to enable resource reclamation and AM capability, but also to advance the state-of-the-art in AM materials technology.  CRG's proposed approach to develop thermally-reversible polymer materials for thermoset polymer reprocessing, and demonstration of reclamation and manufacturing compatibility evaluation, will provide xxxxxx with a material and processing technology readiness level (xxxxxx) of 5 at the conclusion of the xxxxxx effort.	14669
Dynamic Damage Modeling for IRAC Simulations, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxxted xxxxxx xxxxxx Control (IRAC) Project, Preliminary Technical xxxxxx xxxxxx identifies several causal and contributing factors that can lead to loss of aircraft control.  Among these are adverse conditions and uncommanded motions which may be the result of vehicle or propulsion system failures or damage. One possible source of projectile damage is uncontained engine debris.  This proposal focuses on development of a robust methodology for predicting the damage to aircraft structures from uncontained engine debris. The two objectives of this phase of the work proposed are: 1. xxxxxxment of rigorous criteria and methodology for determining projectile sizes, shapes, velocities, and weights resulting from uncontained engine debris. 2. xxxxxxearch and development of techniques to predict realistic damage sizes and shapes resulting from projectile impacts on aircraft structure.The xxxxxx I xxxxxx is intended to be a proof of concept and demonstration of the feasibility of interfacing UEDDAM with LSDYNA.  One of the main products of the effort will be to well prepared plan for proceeding to xxxxxx. Whereas the xxxxxx I product will be a proof of concept, it will not be ready for commercialization.  It will be a prototype that does not have the user-friendly features such as graphical user interface (GUI).  Nor will it have the ability to account for composite materials in the target.  Thus the xxxxxx effort will focus on these two issues.	14670

In addition to the imagery,       anciliary information is stored within the image headers, as well as a   detailed account of all the reference files used for the calibration.    xxxxxx files needed for further processing are archived as a        separate data set.	14672
Multiple Failure Response Procedure System, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	When an ISHM module identifies a single failure, an associated response procedure, developed and validated in advance, can be selected for execution to verify the diagnosis, safe the system, and perform recovery. xxxxxxver, the ISHM system might return a diagnosis that indicates multiple failures.  Or, it might return an ambiguity group that identifies more than one candidate failure. When multiple failures or ambiguous diagnoses occur, it seems attractive to exploit procedures that were developed in advance to handle each of the individual failures. xxxxxxver, simply combining procedures in just any order might not work due to interactions among the procedure goals and effects.  We propose to develop the xxxxxx Failure xxxxxx xxxxxxedure xxxxxx, which will automatically generate and present procedures for responding to multiple failures and ambiguity groups. During this project, we will iteratively design, implement, and evaluate algorithms for generating multi-failure procedures from procedures developed for responding to single failures. Our approach is based on the belief that it is usually easier to develop procedures and plans from existing procedures that serve as large building blocks, compared to search-intensive methods that construct procedures from primitive steps. To identify and resolve procedure interactions, we will translate procedure specifications into planning domain actions, apply automated planning systems to generate a valid plan, and then translate the plan back into a combined procedure. We will design the procedure generation algorithm and user interface, develop a software prototype, and apply it to several scenarios to demonstrate our approach.	14673
Adaptive Augmented Reality enabled electronic Procedure Toolset, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	The proposed research is aimed at investigating the feasibility to provide an integrated tool suite for development of xxxxxxive user interfaces for Augmented Reality (AR) enabled electronic xxxxxxedures. Human xxxxxx program has relied on procedures to operate efficiently and safely any spacecraft systems since its inception. Over the past few years, efforts to enhance these procedures using Augmented Reality has demonstrated the possibility to increase crew autonomy from ground support by providing improved guidance and just in time training. Many challenges persist in the following areas: difficult and time consuming development of the AR material, a range of potential AR hardware devices and software platforms to deploy on, and limited flexibility of the xxxxxx causing underwhelming user experience. Tietronix proposes to develop a toolset that will support the development of robust and adaptive user interface for the electronic procedures that leverages the power of AR technology. The envisioned toolset combines an authoring environment that enables the user to create electronic procedures with adaptive user interfaces which are dependent on their context of-use defined in terms of the user, platform, and environment. The UI can adapt to multiple elements such as the context in which the procedure is executed (workload, stressful conditions), the user skill level, the deployment platform (AR headset type, VR environment, tablet, phone), the type of cues to be provided. The use of this toolset will enable procedure developers to provide to operators enhanced situational awareness during the execution of the procedures by overlaying additional information such as instructions or graphical cues on top of the target system views, and auditory or tactile inputs. The proposed integrated suite of tools will provide critical technologies needed to develop adaptive UI for AR enabled electronic procedures, and execute these within the context of xxxxxx space program.	14674

InGaP DHBT for High Efficiency L-band T/R Module, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	A fully monolithically integrated L-band T/R module using Inxxxxxx/xxxxxx-based HBTs (heterojunction bipolar transistors) for both the transmit and receive functions is proposed. We plan to improve the efficiency by implementing a DHBT (double heterojunction bipolar transistor) Inxxxxxx HBT which is designed reduce the offset voltage. This DHBT design can offer a higher efficiency as well as increasing the safe operation region (SOA), which benefits both the low noise and high power requirements of a T/R module.  The footprint of the device is expected to be reduced by 20-30% by integrating the T/R function using the same device Inxxxxxx DHBT platform.   xxxxxx based devices are critical for the realization of reduced size and reduced power consumption MMIC (monolithic microwave integrated circuits) which provide the fundamental building blocks of T/R modules.

In addition, Inxxxxxx/xxxxxx HBTs have been shown to be inherently radiation hard for both proton and g exposure, and are well suited for use in the space environment.	14680
Utilizing High Fidelity Simulations in Multidisciplinary Optimization of Aircraft Systems, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx design is a complex process requiring interactions and exchange of information among multiple disciplines such as aerodynamics, strength, fatigue, controls, propulsion, corrosion, maintenance, and manufacturing.  A lot of attention has been paid during the past fifteen years in the xxxxxx-disciplinary Design xxxxxximization (MDO) nature of the aircraft design process.  xxxxxxver, a consistent void in aircraft design is the ability to integrate high-fidelity computational capabilities from multiple disciplines within an organized MDO environment.  xxxxxxting high fidelity simulation technology (that has been developed over the years though significant investments) within a MDO environment will constitute a disruptive technological development in aircraft design.  Currently, each high fidelity simulation is rather compartmentalized, and at best a sequential interaction process is exercised.  xxxxxxting the high-fidelity computational capabilities from multiple disciplines within an organized MDO environment will provide the ability to capture the implications that design changes in a particular discipline have to all other disciplines.  It will also be possible to share design variables among disciplines and thus identify the direction that design variables should follow based on objectives and constraints from multiple disciplines.  During the xxxxxx I effort the feasibility of utilizing high fidelity CFD simulations for shape optimization and combining them with a structural finite element simulation for strength considerations within a multi-discipline design optimization environment will be demonstrated.  A wing configuration will be analyzed for showcasing the different steps of this development and the benefits.	14681

GaN Based UV Sensors for Earth Resources Management, Phase II	2008-06-01	2018-07-19	This work represents the exploitation of a unique method of crystal growth -- constrained epitaxy (CE) -- in the manufacture of low-noise, multi-color UV sensors. The sensors developed here are based on the xxxxxx/Alxxxxxx materials system and are sensitive in the wavelength range from 250-400nm. xxxxxx responsivities are > 0.1 A/W throughout the spectral interest range. The first arrays produced under phase 1 were sensitive both to 285 and 315 nm simultaneously. xxxxxxcolor sensitivity improves background noise rejection and provides much more detailed analysis of atmospheric aerosol scattering. Noise is dominated by diode reverse leakage and is less than 10-9A/cm2. The CE manufacturing process is enabled by the recognition that surfaces on which radiation sensitive materials are grown cannot be exposed to plasma etch effluents. To overcome this limitation, a dielectric lift-off-lithography process was developed. In this process, the growth surfaces only come in contact with organic solvents and photosensitive plastics during manufacture. Initial results were obtained on a 10 x 10 diode array. In subsequent work, we intend to produce 100 x 100 arrays. In addition, it the range of attainable spectral sensitivities will be mapped out by studying the range of achievable Alxxxxxx stoichiometries that are practically attainable.	14687

We propose an alternative way to monitor the health or illnessof the crew members that would provide continuous monitoring of bloodanalytes.

Toward Autonomous Stable Energy Management of Hybrid Electric Aircraft Propulsion Systems, Phase II	2018-05-01	2018-07-19	We have demonstrated the ability of our Dynamic xxxxxx and Decision xxxxxxs (xxxxxx) framework to structure a systems approach to the modeling and control of aircraft electric power systems. To begin, we selected two example aircraft power systems and developed dynamic models for those systems within the xxxxxx framework.  Next, we derived optimized sets of control set points for the power systems.  Each set of set points constituted an optimized allocation of resources under an assumed aircraft operating condition.  A separate set of control set points was derived for each assumed operating condition.  To do so the selected aircraft electric power systems were first mapped into equivalent terrestrial power systems. The NETSS optimization software for terrestrial electric power systems was then applied to optimize the aircraft power systems.  Finally, we developed and stabilizing controllers for electric power system operation around each set point set.  To do so, critical, and potentially unstable, aircraft electric power system dynamics were first identified for closed-loop control.  Finally, the required controllers were designed and simulated to show that they indeed stabilized the dynamics around the prescribed set points. All accomplishments were greatly facilitated by the xxxxxx framework.	14690

3D High Density Wave Interconnects, Phase II	2014-05-01	2018-07-19	Nuvotronics has developed and optimized the PolyStrataTM process for the fabrication of intricate microwave and millimeter-wave devices. These devices have primarily been rectangular coaxial transmission lines, although rectangular waveguide and other structures have also been demonstrated. Intricate devices have been demonstrated with insertion loss 5 to 10 times lower than traditional planar circuits; isolation better than 60dB for lines that share separating walls; multiple levels of densely-packed coaxial circuits; and low-parasitic attachment to active devices and traditional circuit boards. In this xxxxxx project, Nuvotronics will optimize and fabricate high density low-loss millimeter backplane circuits to package and interconnect components of future xxxxxx millimeter wave (xxxxxx) radars. The significance of the innovation primarily lies in three areas: reduction of system size, weight and loss in xxxxxx radars.

Electronics Modeling and Design for Cryogenic and Radiation Hard Applications, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	We are developing CAD tools, models and methodologies for electronics design for circuit operation in extreme environments with a focus on very low temperature and radiation effects. These new tools and methodologies will help enable xxxxxx to design next generation electronics. Such capabilities will significantly improve reliability, performance and lifetime of electronics that are used for space applications, including satellites and space travel. This will be achieved through the development of novel physics-based modeling techniques and verified by experiment. The new cryogenic design tools will greatly reduce the chances of error during actual circuit implementation, and thus reduce the number of design cycles, thereby substantially decreasing fabrication times and expenses. xxxxxx and CAD tools are relatively inexpensive as compared to fabrication costs; thus the results of this project should provide a very large return on investment.	14694
Tailorable Porous Ceramics via Freeze Casting	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	Freeze casting of ceramics is a novel technique used to produce porous materials. The process involves solidifying a solvent in a ceramic slurry to produce a frozen network, subliming the frozen solvent, and sintering the remaining porous powder network. xxxxxx for porous ceramics include filters, catalysts, high temperature insulation, and electrodes for energy devices. Yet the pore network, structure and morphology required for each of these applications vary widely. xxxxxxhough recent studies have explored how processing parameters affect pore fraction, size and shape, less attention has been paid to the internal structure and connectivity of the network, both critical components in porous materials performance. The goal of the proposed research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the freeze-casting process sufficient to establish pore structure-property relationships. xxxxxx oxide in slurries made with water and camphene will be used as control materials for the study but other energy-related ceramics of interest to xxxxxx will be included to validate the findings. Characteristics of a pore network include percent porosity, connectivity of pores, pore shape, size and size distribution, specific surface area, and tortuosity. These will be determined using two- and three-dimensional imaging coupled with porosimetry and surface area measurements. An important outcome of the research will be a model which relates processing parameters to the characteristics of the resulting pore network. This model will enable the fabrication of porous ceramics with specific pore network properties for desired applications.	14695
Non-Invasive Environmental Sensing System for Lifecycle Management (NIEL), Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	SDC's Non-Invasive Environmental sensing system for Lifecycle management (NIEL) can be integrated during manufacture of composites making up habitats and space structures to provide up to the minute environmental data on the system over the entire lifecycle of the part from the moment the first ply is laid down to the time when the structure is retired. The NIEL system will include a network of strain, thermal, radiation, and damage sensing fiber optic sensors that are seamlessly embedded at various depths within the composite plies, tows, or weave making up the structure. In this xxxxxx I xxxxxx, SDC will design, analyze, manufacture, and test a non-invasive fiber optic sensor embedding manufacturing process that provides unparalleled manufacturing and performance data at each ply depth within the part. The process will be non-invasive such that the embedding process is an integral component of the composite material, the fiber optic sensors do not induce failure initiation, and the sensor connector ends are ingressed/egressed from the part through a robust capillary compatible with the resin matrix. SDC will evaluate the embedding processes for survivability and performance and test the integrated parts to demonstrate the capability of the NIEL system for space structure lifecycle management.	14696
A Molecular Genetic Basis Explaining Altered Bacterial Behavior in Space	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	xxxxxxl behavior has been observed to change during spaceflight. Higher final cell counts enhanced biofilm formation increased virulence and reduced susceptibility to antibiotics have been reported to occur for cells cultured in space . Most of these phenomena are theorized as being an indirect effect of an altered extracellular environment where the carbon source uptake is inhibited and excreted acidic byproducts buildup around the cell due to the lack of gravity-driven transport forces. xxxxxxver to date neither spaceflight results ground-based studies physical measurement techniques nor computational approaches have provided sufficient evidence needed to confirm this model. xxxxxx expression data from the Antibiotic Effectiveness in xxxxxx (AES-1) experiment however have now allowed us to look into the biomolecular processes behind these observations and showed a systematic activation of glucose starvation and acid resistance genes. These results corroborate the reduced mass transport model proposed to govern bacterial responses to spaceflight. Furthermore the gene expression data suggests that metabolism was stimulated in space which could play a role in causing the observed increase in bacterial cell concentrations in microgravity. Similarly the decrease in extracellular pH may also be involved with the reported increase in virulence in space.	14697

Lightweight Magnetic Cooler with a Reversible Circulator, Phase II	2009-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx future missions to investigate the structure and evolution of the universe require highly efficient, very low temperature coolers for low-noise detector systems.  We propose to develop a highly efficient, lightweight space magnetic cooler that can continuously provide remote/distributed cooling at temperatures in the range of 2 K with a heat sink at about 15 K.  The proposed magnetic cooler uses an innovative cryogenic circulator that enables a lightweight magnetic cooler to operate at a high cycle frequency to achieve a large cooling capacity.  The ability to provide remote/distributed cooling not only allows flexible integration with a payload(s) and spacecraft, but also reduces the mass of the magnetic shields needed.  The circulator has heritage in Creare's space-proven micro-turbomachinery technology which has demonstrated long-life (>10 years) with no-discernable emitted vibrations.  The proposed system will be lighter than current multistage ADRs.  In xxxxxx I, we proved the feasibility of the magnetic cooler by showing its high thermal efficiency, light weight, and high reliability through detailed component design and system performance analysis.  In xxxxxx, we will design, build, and test a prototype circulator module at design conditions.  We will deliver the circulator module to xxxxxx for integration into a prototype magnetic cooler.	14701
Performance Characterization of Alternative Hypergolic Propellants	2017-08-01	2018-07-19	In an effort to expand upon the nation's leadership and excellence in space technology, xxxxxx must continuously innovate. xxxxxxment of a stable, nontoxic hypergolic propellant option will produce more effective, affordable, and sustainable space exploration capabilities on all scales. The efforts described in this proposal will focus on the parallel investigation of new green propellants in both their neat and gelled forms based on parameters important to rocket applications including ignition delay, characteristic velocity, and specific impulse. Drop tests will be performed to identify candidate green propellants. Selected samples will be further evaluated in a rocket test article at pressure up to 200 psia to compare against the state-of-the-art baseline of monomethylhydrazine and red-fuming nitric acid measured in the same article. These findings will allow rapid iteration on alternative liquid hypergols and the potential investigation of gelling options to reduce, and ideally, eliminate instability, toxicity and the performance gap relative to MMH/RFNA. xxxxxxies will most directly further xxxxxxs In-xxxxxx Propulsion xxxxxx xxxxxx (02) by producing green, high energy density liquid and gelled bipropellants. The advancement of safer hypergolic propellants that meet or potentially even exceed the current performance standard will drastically reduce cost and risk currently limiting their implementation while heeding the call for a greener stewardship of Earth.	14702
A Compact Fluorescence Lifetime Excitation-Emission Spectrometer (FLEXEMS) for Detecting Trace Organics, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	In this Small Business xxxxxxovative xxxxxxearch (xxxxxx) effort, Leiden Measurement xxxxxx (LMT) proposes to design and build the xxxxxx Lifetime Excitation Emission xxxxxx (FLEXEMS), a stand-off fluorescence spectrometer that uses multiple light-emitting diodes to excite fluorescence in samples from the deep-ultraviolet through the visible and employs time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) and steady-state photon-counting techniques to quantify the fluorescence properties of the target in order to detect and identify trace levels of organics in-situ. The addition of fluorescence lifetime measurements distinguishes it from other compact, field-portable instruments available. For typical use, the instrument will require no reagents or consumables and by simply placing the instrument on a sample of rock, soil, or ice, or other material it will be able to detect a wide range of organics (at or below the 10-100 ppb-level) including free aromatic amino acids; biomarkers including F420 (specific to methanogens), NADH, and proteins; PAHs; and porphyrins (e.g. chlorophyll). It will be designed with flight in mind so that mass, volume, and power-usage will be minimized as much as possible.	14703
Computational Design of an Additive Manufacturing Process to Produce Tailorable, Multifunctional Gradient Alloys	2016-10-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxweight, multifunctional structural materials technology has been identified as a critical strategic need by xxxxxx and is the highest-priority materials challenge identified by the xxxxxxional xxxxxxearch Council. Additive manufacturing (AM) methods such as laser engineered net shaping (LENS) have unlocked new possibilities for materials design, enabling unprecedented control over the design of bulk materials at the microstructural level and raising the prospect of designing new materials literally from the ground up. This is particularly promising for the novel engineering trade-offs made possible by gradient alloys.A gradient alloy is a material that has a composition that varies continuously along one or more directions. These materials enable the physical properties of a component to be spatially optimized for multiple service functions. The lack of sharp interfaces created by traditional joining operations reduces stress concentrations that could lead to failure. Designing new gradient alloys is a haphazard process for the same reason that the joining of dissimilar metals by laser welding proves challenging, namely the prevalence of brittle intermetallic phases in the intermediate compositions of many desirable gradients such as xxxxxx, xxxxxx and xxxxxx. CALPHAD-based thermodynamic and kinetic models can be used to project arbitrary paths in phase space for systems with any number of components. When the processing conditions are controlled, phase diagrams become maps for navigating the composition design space of gradient alloys.The purpose of this work is to develop a software-based design tool, based on computational thermodynamics and kinetics, for determining optimal thermal processing conditions for producing gradient alloys by additive manufacturing. Because of the prevalence of a requirement to join the two alloys in structural applications, the design of a stainless steel to aluminum gradient alloy will be initially considered. The proposed work will provide an open software framework for the design of gradient alloys by laser-based additive manufacturing methods. Experimental studies of the thermodynamics and transformation kinetics of stainless steel and aluminum will be used to validate the results of theoretical calculations. Finally, the most promising candidate gradient path will be used to make processing recommendations for a prototype stainless steel to aluminum gradient alloy.	14704
Antimony-Based Focal Plane Arrays for Shortwave-Infrared to Visible Applications, Phase II	2018-04-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop antimony-based focal plane arrays (FPAs) for xxxxxx imaging and spectroscopy applications in the spectral band from visible to shortwave-infrared (xxxxxx), viz. wavelengths from 0.5 - 2.5 microns. We will leverage recent breakthroughs in the performance of midwave and longwave infrared FPAs based on the InAs/xxxxxx/AlSb material system in which QmagiQ has played a key part. In these spectral bands, this novel sensor already offers performance comparable to mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) but at a fraction of the cost due to the leveraging of commercial growth and process equipment. Our goal is to extend that benefit into the shortwave infrared. Using the best material currently available and a novel bandgap-engineering design and process, we will fabricate FPAs and measure how the antimony-based sensor compares to state-of-the-art shortwave MCT in terms of quantum efficiency and dark current. In xxxxxx I, we developed the basic building block - a high-performance xxxxxx photodiode. In xxxxxx, we will develop FPAs in a variety of formats and deliver them to xxxxxx for evaluation for its astronomy and planetary missions.	14705
Inductive Monitoring System (IMS)	2010-09-10	2018-07-19	IMS: Inductive xxxxxx xxxxxx The Inductive xxxxxx xxxxxx (IMS) is a tool that uses a data mining technique called clustering to extract models of normal system operation from archived data. IMS works with vectors of data values. IMS analyzes data collected during periods of normal system operation to build a system model. It characterizes how the parameters relate to one another during normal operation by finding areas in the vector space where nominal data tends to fall. These areas are called nominal operating regions and correspond to clusters of similar points found by the IMS clustering algorithm. These nominal operating regions are stored in a knowledge base that IMS uses for real-time telemetry monitoring or archived data analysis.  During the monitoring operation, IMS reads real-time or archived data values, formats them into the predefined vector structure, and searches the knowledge base of nominal operating regions to see how well the new data fits the nominal system characterization. For each input vector, IMS returns the distance that vector falls from the nearest nominal operating region. xxxxxx that matches the normal training data well will have a deviation distance of zero. If one or more of the data parameters is slightly outside of expected values, a small non-zero result is returned. As incoming data deviates further from the normal system data, indicating a possible malfunction, IMS will return a higher deviation value to alert users of the anomaly. IMS also calculates the contribution of each individual parameter to the overall deviation, which can help isolate the cause of the anomaly.	14706

Ground Processing Optimization using Artificial Intelligence Techniques, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx (KSC) has the most complex, enormous, difficult, diverse, distributed, and unique set of integrated scheduling problems in the world and it is only getting more difficult as ground resources need to be shared by different organizations. KSC's scheduling problem is decomposed into many individual but coordinated scheduling problems, each with its own unique set of resources, tasks, constraints, ground rules, and scheduling techniques, resulting in different scheduling processes for each of the individual applications. xxxxxx existing xxxxxx intelligent planning and scheduling system development framework was specifically designed for KSC ground operations scheduling and to be highly adaptable to different domains and has already proven to be adaptable by its successful applications in many dozens of widely varying domains (including multiple KSC scheduling domains).

The proposed vision is to develop one scheduling tool that SMEs in wildly different KSC areas can adapt to create automated scheduling software for different scheduling applications. xxxxxx capabilities need to be added to address the new KSC realities and to make the adaptation process more SME-friendly. Initially the Intelligent Operations xxxxxx xxxxxx (IOSS) would be fielded in a small number of vehicle and payload processing applications.  xxxxxxer SMEs could adapt IOSS themselves. Eventually, IOSS-based automatic scheduling systems might constitute the majority of schedule decision making at KSC. These separate IOSS scheduling applications could automatically interact, providing automated coordination capabilities. These applications will also be able to interoperate with legacy scheduling systems. Ultimately, by automating, replacing, or interfacing to every scheduling function or system, extreme synergies of coordination and manpower savings would result.	14716
Compact Drive System for Planetary Rovers and Space Manipulators	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	The overall purpose of this project is to study the development of a new articulated robotic arm aimed at improving the dexterity, modularity, strength, and torque output of current space manipulation systems. The key enabling technology for the proposed robotic arm is its novel joint, xxxxxx (GBD). The GBD is a newly developed actuation concept based on xxxxxx high-reduction planetary gearbox technology and new brushless “outrunner” motor technology. Due to its unique arrangement of planetary transmission and drive motor, the GBD is able to combine the motor, transmission and position sensing elements into a space that is volumetrically smaller than a human elbow joint. This combination produces ultra-compact actuators with incredible high torque output (more than 100 Nm), micro-precision accuracy, and strong and rugged structural integrity. These unique characteristics of the GBD facilitate the development of high payload-to-weight robots that are otherwise unattainable with traditional actuators.The proposed project, which will focus on the design and fabrication of a six degrees-of-freedom space manipulator using xxxxxx joint technology, is divided into three main milestones. The first milestone involves conducting research and development on the GBD to improve xxxxxx Readiness xxxxxx from proof-of-concept (xxxxxx) into proven full-scale feasibility validation (xxxxxx 6). The second milestone involves designing and developing the space manipulator according to a specific xxxxxx application. The third milestone comprises testing and demonstrating the system capability in aerospace applications and publishing results.The proposed manipulator is expected to bring unprecedented strength and dexterity advantage and deployment modularity to space-based robotic manipulators. The research will shed light on new mechanisms of actuation and introduce a new class of compact powerful actuators with the potential to impact a number of space technology disciplines from space humanoids to powered exoskeletons and planetary rovers drive systems.	14717

Extreme Environment SiC Wireless Sensor Suite for Nuclear Thermal Propulsion Engines, Phase II	2015-03-01	2018-07-19	There are a number of critical telemetry measurements to be monitored under continuous field operation, including temperature data across the reactor chamber and the nozzle, pressure data, neutron flux density and flow rate of the propellant. Real-time monitoring of this data in nuclear thermal engines would greatly improve operational safety and performance, reduce operational costs, and significantly impact maintenance costs and reliability. Even though some extreme environment sensors become available recently, it is still impossible to directly and accurately measure the critical operational parameters of NTP engines due to the lack of extreme environment electronics for those sensors. xxxxxx from extreme environment sensors is delivered via wire-line to an external actively cooled electronics box, where it is processed. This approach presents significant drawbacks such as the need for complex shielded wiring harnesses that not only are heavy but also limit sensor location and signal quality (i.e., signal to noise ratio).  Additionally, these systems suffer from reliability issues due to wiring connections. In this xxxxxx xxxxxx, APEI, xxxxxx. will build on the successful demonstration of high temperature wireless transmitter designs during xxxxxx I, to deliver a set of xxxxxx based, integrated wireless sensor-transmitter suites for extreme temperature operation (450 Deg C)  in NTP engines. These sensor suites will allow for the real&#150;time monitoring of critical engine components, reducing the risk of catastrophic failure and decreasing the inherent risk associated with NTP operation. The final wireless sensor systems will be fully integrated into an autonomous 'drop-in' solution for advanced sensing systems, including wireless energy harvesting.	14719

Robust CCSDS Image Data to JPEG2K Transcoding, Phase II	2009-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx from space satellites are often compressed in a lossy manner to ease transmission requirements such as power, error-rate, and data stream size. These requirements differ from standard computer image processing requirements since storage space, processing speed, and power constraints differ between PCs and satellites. To facilitate use of satellite images in applications such as image analysis, dissemination, storage and retrieval, etc., a method is needed to convert images to a widely supported format. Since lossy formats lose information, too many transcodings, poorly performed transcodings, or transcodings between poorly chosen formats will degrade image quality, sometimes making them useless. xxxxxx such as military photos and deep space objects require high quality, so it is desirable to avoid or minimize loss during transcodings. xxxxxx has requested software transcoding from the CSSDS Image xxxxxx Compression recommendation to JPEG2000 (xxxxxx) with minimal image degradation. In xxxxxx I xxxxxx demonstrated mathematically that the wavelets used in the CCSDS format can easily, quickly, and accurately be transformed to the JPEG2000 format. This mathematical proof was implemented in a GUI software tool. For this xxxxxx proposal, xxxxxx xxxxxxs Corporation will create a robust, end-to-end solution for transcoding CCSDS images to widely supported formats for dissemination, using mathematical techniques developed during xxxxxx This will be done in four stages. First we will evaluate or implement production level CCSDS, in order to provide users with an easy to integrate, small, fast implementation of this image compression standard. xxxxxxond, we will create a toolset for optimal conversion to other image formats, including xxxxxx, minimizing transcoding error. Thirdly, since xxxxxx allows a lot of choice for encoding, we will create an optimal xxxxxx encoder tailored for CCSDS images. Finally, we will integrate these toolsets into existing systems as needed.	14721

Verification and Validation of an Innovative Inflatable Structure Design, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	An inflatable habitat is a pressure vessel with flexible shell. Notable features such as low weight, large inflated operational volume, and small pre-deployment volume offer significant advantages over traditional rigid metallic and composite habitat structures. Conventional designs suffer from indeterminacy of load sharing between meridional and circumferential members as well as the internally rigid metal support structure. The designs must functionally index the meridional and circumferential members to one another to minimize sensitivity to manufacturing, handling and operational trauma, all the while maintaining their independent load carrying roles. This design process results in oversized members to account for load uncertainties.The unique xxxxxx High Performance xxxxxx (UHPV) technology provides the solution to the design and manufacture of robust inflatable structures with exceptional accuracy and dimensional stability. UHPV technology provides high shell load containment architecture with fully determinate load pathways that can be modeled mathematically. The lightweight, low cost inflatable fabric structure, consisting of barrier film layers, carrier cloth containment layers, and pressure restraint tendons can be designed and fabricated to provide an accurate geometry without the need for an internal skeletal frame. Eliminating the need for a rigid internal load-bearing frame allows the collapsed inflatable to be packaged in the smallest possible volume.To bring this innovative inflatable design to use for lunar habitats, airlocks and myriad other space environment and containment applications, a verification and validation plan using both testing and predictive analytical models is proposed to conclusively demonstrate that the fully load-determinate UHPV can meet all structural design requirements for habitable space structures and be accurately and repeatedly manufactured.	14728

The key innovations are the use of a new interferometric modality and a novel non-contact optical probe that together measure high surface slope acceptance angles to nanometer sensitivity. When the probe is integrated with a precision motion, x, y, & z metrology frame (xxxxxx) (see xxxxxxure-1), it will meet xxxxxx need to measure free-form optical surfaces from 0.5 cm to 6 cm diameter ranging from F/2 to F/20, including slopes up to 20 degrees (with potential for 60 degrees), with an uncertainty targeted at 2 nm RMxxxxxx probe operation does not require tilting to measure slopes. This results in this simplified cartesian metrology frame, also critical to achieve 2 nanometer measurement uncertainty. These features: nanometer resolution and 20 degree slope acceptance angle, have up to this time not been found in a single probe or sensor, non-contact or contact.

The exponential pattern of postural recovery was similar to that observed in shuttle astronauts post-flight. GVS adaptation did not occur at the vestibular end-organs or involve changes in low-level vestibulo-ocular or vestibulo-spinal reflexes. Faced with unreliable vestibular input, the CNS reweighted sensory input to emphasize veridical somatosensory and visual information to regain postural and locomotor function. After a period of recovery subjects exhibited dual adaptation and the ability to rapidly switch between the perturbed and natural vestibular state for up to 6 months, analogous to veteran astronauts. GVS trained subjects performed significantly better than untrained controls (p=0.01) on a visuomotor task in a full motion simulator during unpredictable motion, suggesting a protective effect of GVS exposure in novel vestibular environments.	14739
Digital Array Gas filter Radiometer Passive Methane Sensing Instrument	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	As one of the driving greenhouse gases, methane&rsquo;s (xxxxxx) presence in the atmosphere affects the Earth&#39;s temperature and climate system. It is emitted from a variety of anthropogenic (human-influenced) and natural sources, among them biomass burning, fossil fuel combustion, and biogenic sources (including wetlands and rice paddies).&nbsp;xxxxxx is hard to track because it comes from many sources and is chemically oxidized in the troposphere by the hydroxyl radical. It also becomes well-mixed in the atmosphere by meteorological systems and diffusive process as it is transported across continents and oceans. Complicating matters even further is the 9-year methane atmospheric lifetime that allows it to accumulate in the atmosphere. xxxxxxreasing methane not only affects tropospheric ozone pollution levels, but methane also absorbs in the infrared, making it 86 times more potent at trapping heat as xxxxxx over a 20-year period.Recent studies (xxxxxx, 2016) suggest that concentrations of methane in the atmosphere are now rising at their fastest pace in two decades, thus raising the urgency of developing and flying space-based methane measuring instruments.The development of the proposed compact, Digital Array Gas filter xxxxxx instrument (DAGR) will serve as the first step in establishing xxxxxx as the leader in constellation-based, temporally nimble, space-based methane measurements. DAGR possesses a footprint and power requirement that readily enables its flight with the already in development xxxxxx active LHR methane/methane isotope instrument on the same smallsat bus.

Brine Recovery in Containment (BRIC)	2013-09-01	2018-07-19	"The Brine xxxxxxidual in Containment (BRIC) system is a technology that enables recovery of water from concentrated brine wastewater. Recovery of water from concentrated brines is a major technology gap in the closure of a water recovery system.  The BRIC concept aims to address specific challenges associated with designing reliable systems that can approach 100% water recovery from brine. These issues include the collection and handling of sticky and potentially toxic brine solids that tend to foul process equipment and reduce the overall efficiency of heat transfer and solids removal. Year 2 of project:  The project continues the development of a microgravity-compatible BRIC evaporation chamber. The current BRIC system is a low-fidelity system/component breadboard used to demonstrate the basic functionality of an \"in-place\" brine drying process.  Under the current BRIC IR&D project, significant progress has been made in the development of a microgravity-compatible BRIC evaporator design.  These advancements include a number of potential BRIC evaporator design concepts employing novel static phase separation approaches based on capillary and surface tension phenomenon.  These design concepts have been furthered through the design and development of sub-scale test articles and methods for testing these systems under conditions of microgravity.  xxxxxx collected through this test program has highlighted the need to further refine the design and validate the performance of a BRIC system for brine dewatering applications in microgravity.

High Power Density, Lightweight Thermoelectric Metamaterials for Energy Harvesting	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	Thermoelectric energy harvesting utilizes materials that generate an electrical current when subjected to a temperature gradient, or simply, a hot and cold source of heat. The temperature gradient source is irrelevant resulting in an exceptionally diverse energy harvesting device. The efficiency of thermoelectric generators however, is lower than comparable alternative energy sources such as photovoltaics. Efforts to increase the efficiency have focused primarily on creating new materials through solid state chemistry. Some minor advances have been made; however, in order to meet the needs of xxxxxx mission activities, the efficiency of thermoelectric generators needs to be increased substantially. Moreover, future power generation systems should exhibit a high power density (watts per area and watts per mass), reduced weight and become a transformational enabling technology that delivers affordable and abundant power. Consequently, this research proposal encompasses a method to substantially increase the thermoelectric power generation efficiency and power density while simultaneously decreasing the thermoelectric material weight. In conclusion, the primary goal of this proposal is to fabricate and test a lightweight thermoelectric metamaterial designed to exhibit high energy conversion efficiency and power density through engineered control over the thermal properties. Additional research goals include the advancement of theoretical understanding of thermoelectric metamaterials, development of computational capabilities for optimization and testing of an actual thermoelectric metamaterial module. The objective of this project is to precisely control the flow of thermal, electrical and thermoelectrical energy by advancing the development of a new class of thermoelectric (TE) materials. The goals of this project are to (1) optimize metamaterial structure so power generation efficiency can be increased; (2) synthesize high power factor materials once deemed inappropriate for efficient thermoelectrical operation due to their large thermal conductivity; (3) assemble and test a thermoelectric module with an optimized TE metamaterial; and then finally, (4) characterize, on a micron scale, the thermal behavior of the metamaterial. Thermal behavior must be experimentally characterized, under a variety of operating conditions, using a research grade infrared (IR) camera. The results will enable validation studies with finite element models.	14749
Model-Based Torque Control of Piezoelectric Ultrasonic Motors, Phase I	2005-01-01	2018-07-19	Piezoelectric ultrasonic motors (PUMs) are ideal actuators for a variety of spaced-based robotics applications. These motors replace conventional drive systems consisting of motor, gear train, and brake with a rugged and reliable actuator containing one moving part. It is not currently feasible to fully exploit the capabilities of PUMs due to the lack of model-based torque control systems. This research will eliminate the barrier to PUM adoption and lead to model-based torque control algorithms and driver hardware. The key result of the xxxxxx I STTR will be demonstration of the feasibility of model-based torque control of PUMs using a passive inertial load. This result will provide assurance that the overall project result, development of model-based torque control hardware and software, is both feasible and attainable. This result will be achieved via the development of a mathematical model relating motor input parameters and speed to output torque and experimental validation of the model.

Active Combustion Control Valve, Phase II	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	Over the past decade, research into active combustion control has yielded impressive results in suppressing thermoacoustic instabilities and widening the operational range of gas-turbine combustors. xxxxxx Combustion Instability Control (ACIC) controls the combustion process such that the heat release profile is modulated to dampen the naturally occurring thermoacoustic instabilities. A major challenge to effective implementation of active combustion control is the availability of valves and actuators that provide adequate flow modulation control authority. The majority of the published work revolves around valves designed to modulate the main combustor flow. At present these valves are not designed to operate in a harsh environment and as such are required to be located outside the main flow path, reducing their control authority. To effectively meet the challenge, valves and sensors that are smaller, more responsive and robust must be developed. Ultimately the control valves are co-located with the fuel injection manifold. The trade-off for the harsh environment operation is the ability to maximize the flow modulation control authority. The objective of this research is to integrate the required control authority into an operational environment. This research continues the development of a light weight fast-acting fuel control valve for harsh environment operation. In the xxxxxx effort, the valve demonstrated the ability to modulate fluid flow at 1,000 Hz.  This demonstrated the valve will allow the precise time dependent fuel control required for lean-burn combustor operability. In this xxxxxx research a Prototype valve is designed, fabricated and flow tested using commercially-available driver circuitry to  demonstrate valve operation in harsh thermal environments.	14752

Evidence-based Metrics Toolkit for Measuring Safety and Efficiency in Human-Automation Systems	2015-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx NOTE: Principal Investigator moved to xxxxxx xxxxxxersity in mid-2015. Project continues at xxxxxx with the same title (Evidence-based xxxxxx for Measuring Safety and Efficiency in Human-Automation /xxxxxxs--NNX15AR28G), period of performance 8/1/2015-7/31/2017, grant #NNX15AR28G. See that project for continued reports.     JULY 2015 PROGRESS xxxxxx    The second year of the project involved extending our qualitative literature review for identifying factors and metrics utilized for assessing human-automation system performance and safety. Additionally, a collaborative workshop was hosted by the xxxxxxersity of Central xxxxxx (UCF) research team to provide an opportunity for experts to share their insights regarding automation design and measurement, as well as to obtain feedback regarding our methods and findings from the project. Current efforts involve preparing to conduct subject matter expert interviews to obtain recommendations from potential end users to optimize the effectiveness and usability of the web-based metrics toolkit. Studies will be the focus of future efforts after the transition of team members to xxxxxx xxxxxxersity during the end of Year 2.    AUGUST 2014 PROGRESS xxxxxx    There is a heavy reliance of automation systems to complete tasks and sustain habitability in the spaceflight context. xxxxxxver, past research has shown that certain risks associated with human-automation interaction can have an impact on performance and safety. In order to design and integrate automation systems effectively, it is important for designers, evaluators, and operators to monitor and assess certain factors associated with human-automation performance and safety. In order for effective monitoring, access to valid metrics and resources to properly assess various conditions of the human-automation system can benefit in the design and application process for a variety of contexts, including spaceflight.    The purpose of the research project is to conduct efforts in developing a metrics toolkit that can be practically utilized for evaluating design and applications of human-automation systems. In this case, a metrics toolkit is defined as a set of resources and metrics that can be used for determining what conditions in the human-automation system can impact performance and safety. Our project involves several phases in order to meet this objective: (1) theoretical framework development, (2) systematic literature review of metrics used to assess human-automation systems, (3) experimental validation of selected metrics.    Year one efforts have been dedicated to the development of a theoretical framework to delineate how various factors can impact human-automation system performance, efficiency, and safety. The framework was guided by an initial literature review about critical factors that have been of interest regarding human-automation interaction. xxxxxx on our initial review, we have categorized and identified factors into three separate facets: (1) inputs, (2) processes, and (3) outcomes. xxxxxx involve the traits of the operator (e.g., personality, expertise), the automation system (e.g., reliability, level of automation), and context (e.g., environmental factors, nature of the task, task complexity). xxxxxx of each of these elements are not impacted by their interaction with one another, but can play a role in how the operators interact with the task environment and automation system during taskwork. xxxxxx are variables that emerge from the interaction between the operator, automation agent, and the environment, and are considered the attitudinal, behavioral, and cognitive factors experienced by the user (e.g., trust, workload, situation awareness) that can impact the performance of the entire system. The outcomes are the dependent variables of interest, such as performance, safety, and efficiency. xxxxxx on our framework, it is theorized that the inputs and processes play a role in the outcomes, and that metrics that capture these critical factors can aid in the assessment of performance and safety in system integration.    xxxxxx on our theoretical framework, the research team has also conducted a systematic literature in order to identify metrics utilized in assessing human-automation interaction, and extract key information that can be used to develop guidelines for measuring these systems. While the literature review is still currently ongoing, we have discovered a wide variety of types metrics used to assess human-automation system performance. Insights based on our literature review will play a role in the development of a metrics toolkit for further phases of the research project.    Additionally, the research team has initiated efforts in hosting a collaborative workshop with measurement and automation experts to (1) gain feedback and insights into our initial work, and (2) provide recommendations and guidelines for applying metrics. Expert outreach is also involving the development of an expert panel that will review our work and provide guidance for metrics selection and validation testing during the future phases of our research project.    After the work conducted in year one, efforts in year two will involve initializing the experimental study to investigate the validity and properties of selected metrics for the proposed toolkit. It is expected that this work will help in identifying which metrics are accurate in their assessment of identifying changes in factors associated with human-automation system performance and safety based on experimental manipulations set to impact critical factors outlined in our theoretical framework.	14755
GaN Bulk Growth and Epitaxy from Ca-Ga-N Solutions, Phase II	2013-05-01	2018-07-19	The innovations proposed here are xxxxxx (38 GHz) group xxxxxx-nitride power FETs and the dislocation density reducing epitaxial growth methods (LPE) needed for their optimal performance and reliability.xxxxxx power transistors with >60% xxxxxx Added Efficiency (PAE) are not commercially available.

Hexavalent-Chrome Free Coatings	2016-03-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx&rsquo;s earlier cooperative efforts with the Department of Defense (xxxxxx) and industry have shown some promising alternatives for specific applications and substrates, but alternatives that meet future program qualifications within xxxxxx have not yet been realized. xxxxxx jointly with the xxxxxx, xxxxxx Centers, industry and the European xxxxxx Agency (ESA), this project will continue to focus on screening testing of hexavalent chrome free coatings that have either been approved for use within the xxxxxx or private sector on aerospace equipment or have shown promise in previous testing by one or more of the project stakeholders. The replacement of hexavalent chrome [Cr (VI)] in the processing of aluminum for high-reliability electronics applications in the aviation and aerospace sector remains a goal of great significance.&nbsp; xxxxxx is the major structural manufacturing material used for avionics type packages both the aircraft (military and commercial) and space flight arena.&nbsp; The processing and maintenance of this material against degradation and corrosion is of prime importance to the electronics community in preserving our defense and space operations capabilities.&nbsp; This includes preserving the integrity of the structure and electronics components within, maintaining proper electrical conductivity, and minimizing impact on radio and electromagnetic interference qualities of the electronics package.xxxxxx to the operability and preservation of aluminum substrates for electronic housings and avionics has been the use of chromated coatings, typically conversion coatings on interior spaces and coating systems (conversion coatings, primers) for exteriors and sometimes hard-chrome plating. Hard chrome plating on components is accomplished through an electrochemical process; the electrochemically adhered chrome provides barrier protection to the substrate by forming a dense self-healing oxide layer on the surface.&nbsp; Though some electronics applications may use hard-chrome plating, it is outside of the scope of this project.&nbsp; Conversely, with applied coatings, the high corrosion resistance offered by chromated films is attributed to the presence of both hexavalent and trivalent chromium in the coating.&nbsp; The trivalent chromium is present as an insoluble hydrated oxide, whereas the hexavalent chromium imparts a &ldquo;self-healing&rdquo; character to the coating during oxidative (corrosive) attack.&nbsp; Hexavalent chrome coatings also play a critical role in supporting and enhancing the adhesion of the primer coating to the substrate.Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) studies have determined that hexavalent chromium poses significant medical risks to users.&nbsp; Hexavalent chromium is considered a potential lung carcinogen.&nbsp; Studies of workers in the chromate production, plating, and pigment industries consistently show increased rates of lung cancer.&nbsp; It has also been shown that direct eye contact with chromic acid or chromate dusts can cause permanent eye damage.&nbsp; Hexavalent chromium can irritate the nose, throat, and lungs and repeated or prolonged exposure can damage the mucous membranes of the nasal passages and result in ulcers.&nbsp; In severe cases, exposure causes perforation of the septum (the wall separating the nasal passages).&nbsp; It has also been proven that prolonged skin contact can result in dermatitis and skin ulcers. Some workers develop an allergic sensitization to chromium and kidney damage has been linked to high levels of dermal exposures.	14759
Adaptive Liners for Broadband Noise Reduction, Phase II	2017-07-01	2018-07-19	This project will combine the advantages of adaptive materials with the simplistic passive design of state-of-the-art acoustic liners to provide the ability to tune them for specific operational frequencies (ex. take-off/cutback, cruise, and approach). Many proposed solutions are not practical from a manufacturing/cost perspective: too complex or add weight to the aircraft that is not justifiable. The requirements for aircraft noise are becoming more stringent with greater emphasis on improvements in performance efficiency and lower fuel consumption. CRG has demonstrated feasibility in implementing adaptive technologies into acoustic liners. The next step is to develop increased understanding at more relevant size scales to demonstrate repeatable liner control performance supported by more extensive acoustic testing runs to understand the initial shifting and increased suppression behaviors that have been observed. Automated cyclic testing of a given adaptive liner parameter will be executed on the order of hundreds of thousands of times to demonstrate the durability of the adaptive material for this application. CRG has focused adaptive liner design on demonstration of tuning reactance to xxxxxx 3-4 in xxxxxx CRG will develop multiple integrated prototype demonstrators with flow duct testing to achieve a xxxxxx at the end of xxxxxx.	14760
Cost-Effective Powder Metallurgy TiAl-Based Components For Aerospace Use, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx titanium aluminide (xxxxxx) alloys with their low density (~3.9g/cm3), good elevated temperature strength, stiffness, creep resistance and acceptable burn and oxidation resistance have excellent potential for use in high temperature aerospace applications at temperatures between 500oC to 1000oC instead of the currently used high density (~8.9g/cm3) Ni-based superalloys. xxxxxxver, its poor intermediate and room temperature ductility cause conventional manufacturing operations such as rolling, forging or drawing to be difficult for titanium aluminides, thus leading to very high cost of xxxxxx components (currently up to $10,000 per 30? by 12? by 0.04? sheet from an offshore source, xxxxxx in xxxxxx).

This low cost approach, which allows flexibility in gauge product, a hot pressing approach, microstructure and mechanical properties of the products as well as formability and joining/diffusion bonding capabilities will be evaluated with the goal of achieving the requirements for structural use. These components can be used in next generation launch vehicle airframe (experiencing extensive aerodynamic heating) and engine applications.	14761
Magnetic Logic Circuits for Extreme Environments, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	The program aims to demonstrate a new genre of all-magnetic logic circuits which are radiation-tolerant and capable of reliable operation in extreme environmental conditions including low temperatures and wide temperature swings.  The circuits are based on tunneling magnetoresistive technology, and are expected to have a greater single-event latchup immunity than semiconductor-based CMOS logic.  Recent breakthroughs in magnetic tunnel junction technology have resulted in magnetoresistive responses in excess of 200%.  With these developments adequate current gain may now be realized to implement practical multi-stage logic circuits.  This work will seek to prove novel gate designs and explore the magnetic thin-film tunneling structures necessary to realize them.	14762

The thruster has been built and run through a burn-in procedure, but a performance characterization is the vital next step in its development. This characterization will include gathering thrust measurements, a detailed analysis of the plasma plume of the thruster, calculating efficiencies, a study of the interactions between multiple discharge channels running at one time, and an investigation of the effect of magnetic field shape on thruster performance. The characterization will occur at multiple points across the entire operating envelope of the thruster, ranging from 2 kW to over 200 kW of discharge power. The discharge power levels of the X3 cause unique facility issues that will be addressed by testing at two different facilities during this characterization. The low half of the performance envelope of the thruster will be investigated inside the xxxxxx at PEPL. At higher power levels, the X3 will be investigated in xxxxxx (VF-5) at xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx. VF-5 offers the ideal facility in which to run the X3 in the upper half of its performance envelope. This has been planned since the genesis of the project, and much of the infrastructure related to the X3 was designed with testing at VF-5 in mind.  The thrust measurements will be collected using an inverted-pendulum thrust stand. Thrust measurements are an important metric on their own, but also are used to calculate a number of important parameters including anode specific impulse. The analysis of the plasma plume will be done with an array of probes, including a Faraday probe, a xxxxxx probe, an ExB probe, and a Retarding Potential Analyzer. The data from these probes additionally will be used to calculate a number of thruster efficiencies. These efficiencies are indicators of thruster performance, and will be used as a comparative tool across multiple operating points. The work proposed here is important on its own, but has further-reaching implications as well. The two biggest technical challenges with xxxxxx, as identified by xxxxxx, are increasing discharge power and increasing lifetime. The X3's main contribution is its power level, but what is proposed here with it will also have influence on thruster lifetime. xxxxxxic shielding has shown great promise in the area of extending lifetimes, and the data collected in this work can be used to explore the possibility of designing the world's first magnetically-shielded NHT. The X3 is a monumental step forward for the field of electric propulsion. Goals stated by xxxxxx put targeted discharge power levels in the 100s of kW, and this thruster should achieve that. xxxxxxver, if future, flight-qualified thrusters are to be built, the X3 must be interrogated fully. Understanding not only the performance values but the phenomena from which they come is essential engineering knowledge to apply to future thruster designs.	14763
Iodine Hollow Cathode, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx, LLC will develop an iodine compatible hollow cathode for use in xxxxxx-effect thrusters. Materials in current state-of-the-art electron emitters, and many of the materials used in mounting hardware, are not compatible in a high-temperature iodine environment. This includes cathodes that use inserts made from porous tungsten impregnated with ceramics containing barium oxide, which can be susceptible to rapid decomposition of the ceramic by iodine, and lanthanum hexaboride-based inserts, which are subject to rapid surface decomposition by iodine. The work function of both types of inserts increases in the presence of iodine, and the temperature of the cathode increases, which further exacerbates the decomposition processes. We will use a materials science based approach to evaluate the chemical interactions between iodine and a range of potential materials at elevated temperature. We will construct and experimentally test candidate cathodes in relevant iodine environments to identify robust, safe-to-handle, chemically-stable material systems. In follow-on work, we will (1) perform long duration wear tests to demonstrate adequately long lifetime capability and (2) integrate the cathodes into iodine storage, feed, and thruster systems through industry and government partnerships.	14764
Snow Water Equivalent SAR and Radiometer	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	After nearly four decades of international effort developing remote sensing techniques, measurement of land surface snow remains a significant challenge. xxxxxxing the tools needed to remotely measure Snow Water Equivalent (xxxxxx) is a&nbsp;priority, as xxxxxx is currently sparsely sampled in-situ, and there is no remote sensing product available for mountainous regions, while spatial xxxxxx estimates are required for current water resource management and climate studies.Snow Water Equivalent xxxxxx and xxxxxx (xxxxxxxxxxxxR)&nbsp;is&nbsp;a tri-band synthetic aperture radar (xxxxxx) and a tri-band radiometer. The radiometer&nbsp;has been in development through ESTO-IIP funds since 2010.&nbsp;xxxxxxxxxxxxR&nbsp;radar&nbsp;system development is the focus of current efforts to provide a state-of-the-art microwave snow measurement system. Both the active and passive bands utilize&nbsp;a highly novel current sheet array (CSA) antenna feed. A combination of radar and radiometric measurements spanning this 8-40 GHz spectrum shows great promise for quantifying the geospatial distribution of surface snow.&nbsp;SnowEx is a multi-year airborne snow campaign that tries to answer a fundamental question:&nbsp;How much water is stored in Earth&rsquo;s terrestrial snow-covered regions? The SnowEx research community wants to fully understand the various techniques, focusing on the challenges presented by forests is the perfect opportunity to collect a unique dataset that will help address the science questions and enable snow mission design trade studies. The goal of this project is to prepare xxxxxxxxxxxxR&nbsp;to participate in the upcoming SnowEx flight campaigns.&nbsp;xxxxxxxxxxxxR is an triple band xxxxxx and radiometer developed through xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Office (ESTO) xxxxxxent xxxxxxubator Program (IIP), and xxxxxx&#39;s Internal xxxxxxearch and xxxxxxment Program (IRAD).&nbsp;The main objective of the proposed work is to develop and demonstrate a tri-band dual-pol xxxxxx sensor; and 2) improve the calibration of xxxxxxxxxxxxR&nbsp;radiometer for snow-water-equivalent (xxxxxx) inversion. The main objective of this proposal is to do the underlying work to get xxxxxxxxxxxxR ready for SnowEx flights in years 2019-2021.&nbsp;Futhermore a&nbsp;new feed is being designed by xxxxxx Corp.&nbsp;and Nuvotronics as a part of an ESTO effort which&nbsp;is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2017. Upon completion, the antenna will be tested at xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx&nbsp;Center. The new feed and reflector antenna will be integrated to the rest of the radar and radiometer system. Once the integration is complete, the full system will be tested inside the anechoic chamber at xxxxxx. An important aspect of this effort is the development of several processing steps to assist in going&nbsp;from raw radar echoes to scientific&nbsp;observations.&nbsp;	14765
Spacesuit Multigas Monitor, Phase I	2016-06-01	2018-07-19	Southwest xxxxxxs xxxxxx. (SWS), in collaboration with the Southwest xxxxxxearch Institute (SwRI), will develop a reliable, ultra compact, low power diode laser multigas sensor to measure carbon dioxide (xxxxxx), ammonia (xxxxxx), oxygen (O2) and water vapor (xxxxxx) concentrations in the presence of saturated and condensable water concentrations appropriate for xxxxxx portable life support system (PLSS). A high sensitivity optical absorption technique known as wavelength modulation spectroscopy will be used in the sensor.The system will be light weight (<1 kg), low power (1 W), and fast (minimum 1 Hz measurement rate). The specifications of the proposed multigas sensor will provide reliable gas concentration measurements to ensure extended operation of the PLSS during extravehicular activities (EVA). The combined xxxxxx I and xxxxxx project will provide xxxxxx with a prototype sensor that will provide the same gas concentration data with equivalent or better accuracy as the current GS-300 and GS-322 sensors with the addition of an ammonia measurement not currently available in the PLSS.	14766
ODYSSEY MARS MARIE CALIBRATED DATA V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	The MARIE (xxxxxx Radiation Environment Experiment), aboard the 2001 xxxxxx spacecraft, was launched on April 7, 2001, and arrived at xxxxxx on October 24, 2001. xxxxxx were collected intermittently during the cruise phase, starting in late April and ending in late xxxxxxy. A problem with MARIE's onboard computer occurred in early August, and the instrument was turned off until early xxxxxxh, 2002, after Odyssey's mapping orbit had been established. xxxxxx have been collected from that time to the present without major interruption. Routine minor interruptions of up to 36 hours have occurred during the orbital phase the instrument's data is erased from local storage (after having been downloaded). MARIE is oriented to point in the direction opposite Odyssey's velocity vector. xxxxxx radiation is for the most part isotropic, so the orientation of Odyssey is usually not critical and references to external coordinate systems are not a part of the data returned by MARIE. There is one exception to the statement that space radiation is isotropic: During the early stages of solar particle events, there can be directionality in the particle flux.	14767
Hydrogen Wave Heater for Nuclear Thermal Propulsion Component Testing, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx has identified Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) as a propulsion concept which could provide the fastest trip times to xxxxxx and as the preferred concept for human space travel. The current xxxxxx Strategic xxxxxx xxxxxx Investment xxxxxx states NTP is a high priority technology needed for future human exploration of xxxxxx. In order to perform component testing in support of NTP engine development, an efficient means for delivering high-flowrate, high-temperature hydrogen is required. Non-nuclear generation of the desired hydrogen flowrates and temperatures for ground test of NTP components and subsystems is problematic.  ACENT xxxxxxoratories is proposing development xxxxxx Wave Heater (HWH) for this application. The HWH is an innovative embodiment of a wave rotor. Wave rotors can be used as a primary compressor/heater or as a topping compressor/heater to multiply the temperature and pressure of an existing compression or heating process. These highly-scalable continuous-flow devices are capable of flow rates upwards of 100 lb/s and temperatures over 5000 F.	14768

Design and Control of a Twelve-Bar Tensegrity Robot	2020-08-01	2018-07-19	A tensegrity (tensional integrity) robot is a lightweight, compliant system consisting of rods suspended in a network of cables. It can absorb large loads on impact, and it can move by actuating its cables. Thus a tensegrity robot can act as both a lander and rover, which is unique from traditional rovers that require separate, complex landing systems. The functionality of tensegrity robots will drastically reduce the cost and complexity of surface exploration missions. Prior work between xxxxxx xxxxxx and the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx, xxxxxx, on tensegrity robotics has utilized a six-bar structure. This work revealed shortcomings to the six-bar structure, such as limited payload-to-deadweight mass ratio, impact orientation sensitivity, and high actuation effort. I propose to develop a twelve-bar tensegrity robot as a solution to these shortcomings. I will approach this research by conducting simulations, constructing a rapid prototype, and then creating two high-fidelity prototypes of the twelve-bar tensegrity robot. This work advances the efficacy of surface exploration missions in support of TA 4, xxxxxx and Autonomous xxxxxxs, and the TAB 4.2, Mobility.	14772

This weather information service will supply information to UAS xxxxxx Control Stations (GCSs) from the Next xxxxxxration Air Transportation xxxxxx (xxxxxx) 4D Weather xxxxxx Cube, the Single Authoritative Source (SAS) for aviation weather information, and associated modules which will determine the impacts that weather will have on the UAS. A centralized distribution system, based on a Service xxxxxxd Architecture (SOA), provides weather and constraint information to airlines and pilots (including UAS operators) - the design follows JPDO guidelines.   In xxxxxx, the design goal is for all aircraft flying in the NAS (including UASs) to have a consistent set of weather constraints.	14773
A high performance, electric pump-fed LOX / RP propulsion system, Phase II	2016-03-01	2018-07-19	To-date, the realization of small-scale, high-performance liquid bipropellant rocket engines has largely been limited by the inability to operate at high chamber pressures in a regeneratively-cooled environment using on-board pumps for propellant pressurization. xxxxxx seeks to fulfill this critical need by using a novel fabrication scheme that builds on previously-demonstrated technologies (under DAxxxxxx and xxxxxx sponsored efforts) to design, fabricate and hot-fire test a pump-fed, 3,000lbf LOX/RP propulsion system.	14774

This new architecture includes a powerful new ISRU method we call “xxxxxxical Mining”. Our anidolic optical mining technique is orders of magnitude faster, lighter, and cheaper than electrically-based ISRU process and avoids robotic augers, harpoons, and asteroid landing systems that will not work due to the dust-rich, micro-g, friable, and heterogeneous nature of asteroids.	14778
An Inferential System for Determination of Candidate Crash Sites for Search and Rescue Operations, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop, test, and prove the feasibility of a methodology for an inferential system for the generation of crash site likelihood maps. These maps will assist in the prioritization of candidate aircraft crash sites to be searched by Search and xxxxxxcue (xxxxxx) operations. The crash site likelihood maps will be created by the fusion of the knowledge and experience of experts in aircraft crash site identification, together with, among others,  knowledge about weather condi-tions, terrain information, and aircraft models.  These maps will indicate the most likely areas where an aircraft may have crashed, and will allow xxxxxx operations to focus their resources in these areas first, leading to faster and more efficient rescue operations.  The proposed work di-rectly and innovatively addresses xxxxxx Search and xxxxxxcue (xxxxxx) mission, by targeting the improvement of xxxxxx operations.  This proposed approach offers the innovation of the intelligent fusion of a variety of data, information and knowledge sources to generate crash site likelihood maps.	14779

Integrated Inflatable Ballute for Planetary Entry, Phase II	2014-05-01	2018-07-19	CFDRC and xxxxxxA are proposing to develop, design and test a highly scalable, mass-optimized inflatable structure that makes maximum utilization of materials in providing tailored stiffness and rigidity for hypersonic entry vehicles. The proposed inflatable structure is a hybrid pressure restraint vessel employing an impervious cloth-reinforced barrier structure enveloped by an integrated array of high-tenacity tendons. The external grid of cordage tendons provides mass- and load pathway-optimized containment of the structure's global pressure loads. In xxxxxx I, the conceptual model was designed and the materials were evaluated for their stiffness. The feasibility of the model was demonstrated for typical xxxxxx trajectory point. xxxxxx efforts will focus on fabricating and testing a prototype of the proposed inflatable structure to validate the design robustness and capability for larger payload masses. Pre and post testing multidisciplinary integrated fluid-structure-thermal simulations will be conducted to provide insight into the aerodynamic, material stress and dynamic characteristics of the model and to verify/optimize the developed design. Wind tunnel testing as well as dynamic aerostructural simulations will be conducted to verify the stability of the model. The developed inflatable concept will be fabricated complete with flexible TPS, multiple protection layers and sensors and will be tested to demonstrate the prototype folding, packaging, and deployment.	14781

A Novel Electrode Material for Thermionic Power Generation, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	The conversion of heat to power has proven to be vital in flight missions where solar power generation is not an option. Radioisotope thermoelectric generators that converted heat produced by a decaying nuclear source to power have been used on missions such as xxxxxx, xxxxxx, Galileo, xxxxxx and xxxxxx.  xxxxxxhough never flown by xxxxxx, thermionic converters have also been investigated for space applications.  Their improved efficiency over thermoelectric generators makes them an attractive option, but the high operating temperatures required have thus far been a significant obstacle to their use.  Thermionic generators convert heat energy directly into electrical power.  An emitter electrode on a heat source emits electrons across a vacuum gap to a cold electrode.  The generated current is pumped through a load where it can do useful work before it is returned to the emitter.  Thermionic generators do not use any moving parts or working fluid, which results in highly reliable devices that do not need frequent maintenance.  Unlike thermoelectric generators, which have exhibited efficiencies only up to about 8%, state-of-the-art thermionic generators operate with efficiencies approaching 20%.  This proposal seeks to study the use of the nanomaterial C12A7 electride as an electrode material.  C12A7 electride has been shown to emit stably at temperatures in excess of 1600 degrees C and has a measured work function between 0.8-2.1 eV.  Due to its low work function, C12A7 electride has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of the state-of-the-art in thermionic energy conversion as well as enable device operation at much lower temperatures than is currently possible.  xxxxxx previously has investigated C12A7 electride in thermionic emission configurations for space propulsion hollow cathode applications.  In the proposed work, xxxxxx will evaluate the potential benefits of a C12A7 electride thermionic converter electrode.	14784
High Thrust Efficiency MPD Thruster, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxxoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters can provide the high-specific impulse, high-power propulsion required to support human and robotic exploration missions to the asteroids, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and the outer planets. MPD thrusters, however, have traditionally been plagued by poor thrust efficiencies due primarily to power lost into the anode caused by the xxxxxx effect. We propose to combine three innovative techniques to create a high thrust efficiency MPD thruster.  The first is an unconventional applied magnetic field geometry that counter the xxxxxx effect near the anode surface, the second is shaping of the electrodes to optimize current uniformity, and the third is \"through-anode\" propellant injection to prevent depletion of the anode plasma.  In prior experiments we demonstrated elimination of the anode fall using these novel magnetic fields, and in recent simulation efforts we developed novel magnetic nozzle designs that succeed in counteracting the current concentrations and plasma starvation effects that cause the anode fall.  These magnetic nozzles also showed the ability to increase the amount of axial thrust extracted from the accelerated plasma by over 50%.  In the xxxxxx I, we will test the effect of a prototype 'optimized' magnetic nozzle on the thrust efficiency of a MPD thruster; both the magnetic nozzle prototype and thruster test article are already constructed.   Additionally, we will develop technology for through-anode propellant injection, and evaluate its performance through tests and simulations."	14785
Electride Hollow Cathode, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx, LLC will develop hollow cathode electron sources based on a novel inorganic electron emitting material. Current state of the art cathodes include barium oxide based cathodes, which are susceptible to contamination, and lanthanum hexaboride cathodes, which must be operated at very high temperatures. In contrast, electride cathodes may provide equivalent emission to existing hollow cathode insert materials at lower working temperatures and lower powers, possibly extending cathode life and simplifying cathode construction and operation. In addition, a modified hollow cathode design will be used to facilitate rapid plasma ignition.	14786

Prognostics for Ground Support Systems: Case Study on Pneumatic Valves	2013-06-19	2018-07-19	Prognostics technologies determine the health (or damage) state of a component or sub- system, and make end of life (EOL) and remaining useful life (RUL) predictions. Such infor- mation enables system operators to make informed maintenance decisions and streamline operational and mission-level activities. We develop a model-based prognostics method- ology for pneumatic valves used in ground support equipment for cryogenic propellant loading operations. These valves are used to control the ow of propellant, so failures may have a signi cant impact on launch availability. Therefore, correctly predicting when valves will fail enables timely maintenance that avoids launch delays and aborts. The approach utilizes mathematical models describing the underlying physics of valve degradation, and, employing the particle ltering algorithm for joint state-parameter estimation, determines the health state of the valve and the rate of damage progression, from which EOL and RUL predictions are made. We develop a prototype user interface for valve prognostics, and demonstrate the prognostics approach using historical pneumatic valve data from xxxxxx refueling system.	14793
Miniature HD6D Navigation and Rendezvous LIDAR & Software, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxs & xxxxxx xxxxxxing Corporation and xxxxxx A&M xxxxxxersity propose a miniature, long range, LIDAR for navigation and rendezvous. The xxxxxx imaging consists of high resolution, rapid framing 3D LIDAR and RGB camera images fused to give an HD resolution image.  The LIDAR output and RGB camera output feed TAMU feature tracking algorithms which give 6DOF relative pose information to all bodies in the FOV.  The images are fused into rigid bodies continuously updated as the imaging continues.  The 6DOF relative pose information simplifies navigation and rendezvous activities and greatly reduces xxxxxx image transmission, as the up dated xxxxxx (volume pixels) of each body can be sent at longer intervals.  xxxxxx resolution for the xxxxxx is 3mm at close range, 28mm at acquisition range.  xxxxxximum range for the xxxxxx LIDAR is 30Km.   The 32 channel receiver 3D imaging rate is range fold over limited to 12.8xxxxxx to 375m varying to 160Kpps at longest range.  The laser transmits a phase coded pulse train which allows a 13/1 pulse compression increasing signal to noise level by 13x and reducing peak power by13x for a given joule transmit.  This lower peak power avoids nonlinear effects in the gain fiber allowing higher joules.	14794

The WK47031 effort (Item 5) constitutes the bulk of the present focus and capitalizes on momentum created by the release of the FY14 Nondestructive Evaluation of xxxxxx State-of-the-xxxxxx xxxxxx (xxxxxx-TM-218560) [10]. The ultimate goal vis-&agrave;-vis WK47031 is to determine the effect-of-defect of specific seeded flaw types while determining detection thresholds using controlled embedded features. A portion of this effort also dovetails with the xxxxxx xxxxxxing and Safety Center (NESC) xxxxxxersal ECT-UT-Profilometer xxxxxx project. Background:&nbsp; One of the main obstacles slowing the acceptance and use of advanced materials (e.g., xxxxxxs, xxxxxx and AM parts) in xxxxxx and commercial space applications is the lack of a broadly accepted materials and process quality systems, including sensitive NDE procedures with well-defined accept-reject criteria. Matching VCO standards are also needed to ensure process and equipment control, finished part quality and consistent inspection methodologies for finished parts after manufacturing and after installation of parts in service. In AM, the possibility to &lsquo;design to constraint&rsquo; offers a paradigm shift opening the door to make parts with shorter production lead times, less waste, improved cost, maximized properties, and reduced weight.&nbsp; xxxxxxver, to fully realize the merits of this and other advanced processing technologies, and to ensure parts of the highest quality end up in xxxxxx/aerospace applications, new approaches to for in-situ monitoring NDE used during manufacturing, post-process NDE used on as-build and finished parts are needed. In AM, for example, NDE procedures must be able to detect flaw types (xxxxxxure 2), many of which are not found in cast, wrought or conventionally welded parts (xxxxxxure 3). xxxxxxply embedded porosity, complex part geometry, and intricate internal features (e.g., lattice structures) impose additional challenges on conventional NDE.&nbsp;Technical xxxxxx: &nbsp;In the WK47031 effort (xxxxxxure 4), a xxxxxx-led interlaboratory study (ILS) is currently being conducted to identify and refine NDE for inspection of AM aerospace parts. This effort is spread across government, industry, academia, the US, Europe, and xxxxxx. A variety of promising NDE methods are being survey such as in-situ infrared thermography, computed tomography, process controlled resonance testing, neutron radiography and structured light metrology. The draft ASTM Guide will be balloted and approved using the ASTM voluntary consensus approval process. A key component will be xxxxxx peer review, in addition to ASTM member-based and industry-focused peer review. The AM processes being examined are Powder Bed Fusion (includes Direct Metal xxxxxx Sintering (xxxxxx), Selective xxxxxx xxxxxxing (SLM) and xxxxxxn Beam xxxxxxing (EBM)); and Direct Energy Deposition (includes xxxxxxn Beam Free Form Fabrication (EBF3)). xxxxxxment of NDE and AM parts best practices through ASTM Committees F42 and E07 will be accomplished during biannually-scheduled ASTM committee week meeting and coordinated with related ISO TC 261 effort.

Radiation Hard Multi-Layer Optical Coatings, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	Next generation space telescopes require advanced optical coatings to provide low loss transmission of light in a variety of spectral ranges and protect optical components from damage in a space environment.

Psychophysiological Monitoring of Aerospace Crew State	2021-08-01	2018-07-19	As next-generation space exploration missions necessitate increasingly autonomous systems, there is a critical need to better detect and anticipate astronaut interactions with these systems. In line with xxxxxx xxxxxxs, 6.3 Human Health and Performance and 4.4 Human-xxxxxx Interaction, the success of present and future autonomous technology in exploration spacecraft is ultimately dependent upon safe and efficient interaction with the human operator. xxxxxx state may be affected by a number of variables including impairment, like fatigue or stress, attention failures, like channelized or diverted attention, and decision failures. I hypothesize that I can objectively classify continuous crew state using psychophysiological monitoring of an aerospace crew. Non-obtrusive monitoring techniques including heart rate and eye tracking will allow for minimalistic instrumentation that could be integrated into future spacecrafts and space habitats. xxxxxx testing and data training will be performed, ideally in a simulated or analogue space environment, to develop task-specific population-based classifiers of crew state. These population-based classifiers could then, in theory, be improved with crew member-specific classifiers. Ultimately, this research aims to develop a non-obtrusive sensor suite and algorithm to detect a suboptimal crew state. Once a crew state is determined, further research into specific countermeasures would be necessary to potentially alter the automation and improve crew state. Combining resources and expertise from xxxxxx and xxxxxx, through the visiting technologist experiences, would be extremely important for the proposed crew state monitoring and countermeasure research.	14802

VCHP Radiators for Lunar and Martian Environments, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	Long-term xxxxxx and xxxxxx systems present challenges to thermal control systems, including changes in thermal load, and large changes in the thermal environment between xxxxxx (or xxxxxx) day and night. The xxxxxx thermal environment typically includes long periods in extremely cold thermal environments.  A variable conductance heat pipe (VCHP) radiator will be developed that passively accommodates the changing thermal load and environment.  In a VCHP, a non-condensable gas is added that blocks a portion of the condenser.  The gas charge blocks more of the condenser as the heat pipe evaporator temperature changes.  This allows the heat pipe evaporators (and any attached heat exchanger) to remain at an almost constant temperature. In addition to passively controlling the thermal load, the gas allows the fluid in the heat pipe to freeze in a controlled fashion as the heat pipe is shut down, avoiding damage.  In addition, the gas in the VCHP will help with start-up from a frozen condition.	14804
Design and fabrication of strain-balanced nBn dual-band LWIR/LWIR focal plane arrays based on InAsSb/InAsType-II superlattices, Phase I	2016-06-01	2018-07-19	The infrared spectral range is of particular interest for remote planetary sensing of gaseous molecules, such as xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, CO, xxxxxx, and many other compounds. xxxxxx thermography can also be used to accurate measure minute variations in surface temperatures. High performance infrared focal plane arrays (FPAs) allow rapid acquisition of a 2D surface maps--indispensable in planetary sciences. By using two different cut-off detectors integrated into a single FPA to simultaneously image a planet we can avoid atmospheric effect and much more accurately map minute variations in the surface temperature, or gain a clearer picture of the atmospheric composition. In recent years, xxxxxx-II InAs/xxxxxx superlattices have experienced significant development&#151;we have played a pioneering role in the rapid development of that technology.  xxxxxxver, the full potential of xxxxxx-II superlattice has not been fully explored and alternate superlattice architectures hold great promise; one of the most promising is gallium free xxxxxxxxInAs xxxxxx-II superlattices. In this project, we propose to study strain-balanced nBn InAs1-xSbx/InAs xxxxxx-II superlattice-based photodetectors and mini-arrays for xxxxxx/xxxxxx dual-band detection. Using this new superlattice structure, it is expected to achieve longer minority carrier lifetime. xxxxxx minority carrier lifetime results in lower dark current, lower noise, higher operation temperature, and higher quantum efficiency. xxxxxxlying this superlattice design to dual-band xxxxxx/xxxxxx FPAs, it is expected to achieve higher quantum efficiency, lower dark current, higher specific detectivity (D*) and reduced Noise Equivalent Temperature Difference (NETD).    This work will form the basis of the xxxxxx work in which we will use this new superlattice structure to develop and deliver xxxxxx/xxxxxx dual-band FPAs for planetary sciences.	14805

This dataset includes xxxxxx from the East xxxxxxs (HIEs) which comprise a global map of I/F measured by the NAC or WAC filter 7 (both centered near 750 nm) during the the Extended Mission at high incidence angles to accentuate subtle topography, photometrically normalized to a solar incidence angle (i) = 30 degrees, emission angle (e) = 0 degrees, and phase angle (g) = 30 degrees at a spatial sampling of 256 pixels per degree. The HIE data set is a companion to the Map Projected High-xxxxxx Illluminated from xxxxxx (HIW) data set. Together the two data sets are intended to detect and allow the mapping of subtle topography. They complement a Basemap xxxxxx Record (BDR) data set also composed of WAC filter 7 and NAC images acquired at moderate/high solar incidence angles centered near 68 degrees (changed to 74 degrees in the final end-of-mission data delivery), and a Low xxxxxxidence xxxxxxle (LOI) data set also composed of WAC filter 7 and NAC images acquired at lower incidence centered near 45 degrees, analogous to the geometry used for color imaging. The map is divided into 54 'tiles', each representing the NW, NE, SW, or SE quadrant of one of the 13 non-polar or one of the 2 polar quadrangles or 'Mercury charts' already defined by the USGS. Each tile also contains 5 backplanes: observation ID; BDR metric, a metric used to determine the stacking order of component images, modified for the higher incidence angle centered near 78 degrees; solar incidence angle; emission angle; and phase angle.	14806
Augmented Reality to Enhance Crew Medical Training	2012-04-01	2018-07-19	Due to the large and diverse set of possible medical conditions, crew medical training focuses on the most likely medical scenarios that may occur in the current mission profiles, with less emphasis on rarer, or unforeseen health related events. The need for good training and the access to large amounts of documentation areconditions making the use of Augmented Reality (AR) techniques most promising.  One of xxxxxx strategic goals is to extend and sustain human activities across the solar system. With time delays and potentially sparse communications back to Earth, astronauts may have to perform life-saving surgery without support from the Earth based flight control team. Medical crew training is a complex and labor-intensive process. Due to the large and diverse set of possible medical conditions, crew medical training focuses on the most likely medical scenarios that may occur in the current mission profiles, with less emphasis on rarer, or unforeseen health related events. The need for good training and the access to large amounts of documentation areconditions making the use of Augmented Reality (AR) techniques most promising. Also, the use of medical AR for crew training could enhance effectiveness, and expand the repertoire of available on-mission aids while minimizing resource utilization saving time, money and potentially improving outcomes.	14807
Moisture Resistant Primer for Composite Bonded Repairs, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	Aging and durability of aircraft in both the military and civilian sectors are becoming major issues as the existing fleet continues to age.  Additionally, the increased use of composite structures in the civilian fleet, such as in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A380, make the understanding and/or improvement of composite durability, particularly durability of repairs, even more critical.  Several areas have been identified as targets for improvement in composite aircraft repair.  These include the development of rapid, low temperature repair methods and associated materials as well as development of the quality of repairs when they are made.  Adhesion of bonded repairs is one area that needs to be addressed. Adherent Technologies, xxxxxx. is proposing a novel moisture-resistant primer system for use in repairs of standard carbon/epoxy composites used in many subsonic aircraft.  Our proprietary chemistry comprised of a reactive coupling agent and a carrier resin compatible with standard aerospace epoxy resins bonds directly to the prepared aircraft composite surface while retaining residual functionality that can be cured directly into the matrix of the repair leading to a covalently bound repair, thereby strengthening the repair interface.  Proper selection of the coupling agent structure and carrier resin can serve to further enhance the moisture resistance and thereby durability of the composite repair.	14808

Development of a Mechanically Versatile Bioreactor System as a Cellular Microgravity Countermeasure for Regenerative Medicine Applications	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	The primary objective of this research project is to develop a compact, mechanically versatile bioreactor capable of producing desired local mechanical environments to stimulate optimal cell proliferation, differentiation and tissue formation for a wide range of regenerative medicine applications in microgravity. Specifically, I aim to develop a novel strategy using time-varying magnetic fields to manipulate magnetic “handles” embedded within a deformable substrate or scaffold, thereby allowing a wide range of local mechanical environments to be produced using a single device with minimal moving parts. Mechanical unloading due to microgravity has detrimental effects on a range of cellular behaviors, and the lack of appropriate cell- and tissue-level stresses is expected to impair healing of musculoskeletal injuries as well as reduce the viability and effectiveness of native stem cells that normally participate in repair and regeneration. The proposed system will facilitate the development and refinement of countermeasures to maintain the endogenous population of stem cells required for normal tissue renewal and healing in space and could constitute a primary component of an astronaut stem cell replacement mechanism to be used during missions.xxxxxxy stages of the project will focus on the integration of magneto-mechanical stimulation to produce a highly robust loading system that can produce mechanical environments optimized for various cell types. An initial line of work will involve embedding small magnetic “handles” into a layered, paper-based scaffold and developing a properly-shielded magnetic control system to manipulate the scaffold to produce a range of time-varying loading states. xxxxxx approaches will be used to determine the optimal placement of the handles and optimal activation patterns for external magnetic fields to achieve loading modes hypothesized to be necessary for healthy cell behavior. xxxxxxer stages of the project will focus on packaging the bioreactor system for integration into existing space vehicle confines and common power consumption limits as well as integrating it with existing bioculture systems, to promote a constant sterile environment for the cells.	14810

High-Speed, Low-Power ADC for Digital Beam Forming (DBF) Systems, Phase II	2013-05-01	2018-07-19	In xxxxxx, xxxxxx Group designed a high-speed, yet low-power silicon germanium (SiGe)-based, analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to be a key element for digital beam forming (DBF) systems that will be used in xxxxxx future radar applications. The ADC will employ a novel combination of time interleaving, high-speed silicon-germanium BiCMOS technology and low-power techniques, such as the double-sampling technique, providing exceptional sampling speed of 500 xxxxxxS, 1.5 GHz analog bandwidth,12 bits of resolution, and below 500 mW power dissipation, exceeding xxxxxx requirements. Ordinarily, ADC design requires large trade-offs in speed, resolution, and power consumption. The significance of this innovation is that it simultaneously provides a high-speed, high-resolution, and low-power ADC that is well ahead of the state of the art. These three characteristics are needed for DBF systems that contain large ADC arrays. The power consumption of existing ADC chips prohibits implementation of large DBF arrays in space. xxxxxx's innovative design leverages newer semiconductor process technologies that combine silicon and germanium into a compound semiconductor.xxxxxx has identified two xxxxxx 2 objectives, which are:1.Design, fabricate and characterize Test xxxxxx 1 that contains critical ADC subcircuits. 2.Design, fabricate and characterize Test xxxxxx 2 that contains the complete radiation tolerant, digitally calibrated, time-interleaved ADC design.

Sensitive, selective nanoantenna-based biosensor platform for compact, in-situ exo-life detection and astronaut life support	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	We aim to develop a new nanotechnology-enabled sensing platform exceeding the sensitivity and selectivity of the current state-of-art (SOA) in portable, low-mass, low-complexity biochemical sensors. This system is a new capability for space exploration/science applications, e.g. exo-life detection in challenging cryogenic environments, including multiplexed arrays in planetary probes, distributed sensor swarms for use with xxxxxx, and other platforms, and builds upon our existing efforts at both xxxxxx xxxxxx (GRC) and Dartmouth College.  Localized surface plasmon resonances (xxxxxxRs) – the collective electron oscillations excited in nano-sized metallic particles (‘nanoantennas’) by incident optical light – have been utilized extensively as sensitive, label-free optical probes for the study of biochemical interactions in both gas and liquid phase, due to their highly confined electric fields and extreme sensitivity to changes in their local environment (e.g. the presence of a target biomolecule.)  The ultimate limit of detection – single molecule detection – has been demonstrated with such sensing platforms, and will form the basis of our sensing approach. Yet, the selective capture of rare targets from a complex background near these transducers remains both a challenging problem and necessary step to advance this technology out of the lab and into the field. Therefore, we aim to close this critical knowledge gap in the current proposal, through the development of the tailored nano-recognition elements coupled to sensitive plasmonic nanoantennas. We will primarily focus on exo-life applications – as these are currently the most challenging and least understood – but with further application to astronaut life support, pathogen detection, and water quality monitoring.  Field-deployable xxxxxxR-based sensors are currently being explored for terrestrial point-of-care (POC) medical applications by other groups, including our external collaborator for this award at Dartmouth College. These devices are also conducive to the demanding requirements of space exploration, owing to their low-mass, volume, and power consumption, and ruggedization/simplicity in operation. Further, their small size, and relatively low cost with high sensitivity provide capabilities not possible with larger, more complex, centralized instruments (e.g. mass spectrometer). xxxxxxver, xxxxxxR-based sensors (and mass spectrometers) are limited in their demonstrated ability to selectively capture and uniquely identify the target analytes in-situ (in possibly challenging environments), with minimal processing/contamination. This proposal is aimed at enabling this critical step towards a new class of chemical/biochemical measurements for space exploration applications.  The goal is to advance the SOA in selective capture and sensitive detection of rare biomarkers in-situ, using small, portable, deployable biosensor platforms, with a particular focus on exo-life detection, and possible extension/application to in-flight astronaut life support (including water quality monitoring, health diagnostics, and pathogen detection).	14813

This proposal will investigate the assembly of solar array modules to a backbone truss. The general process will use up to 6 IPJRs to grapple, precisely precision, and align a solar array module relative to a backbone truss and hold the module in place while xxxxxxghtweight xxxxxx Manipulation xxxxxx (LSMS) completes joining operations. FY16 xxxxxx benchmark will be a teleoperated assembly experiment that does not include simulated errors, disassembly, or reassembly. It will incorporate a xxxxxx algorithm for state estimation, but use high level commands given by human operators.

PVO VENUS ONMS BROWSE SUPERTHERMAL OXYGEN 12 SECOND V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	The instrument has detected superthermal, energetic or fast ions whose energy exceeds 36 eV in the spacecraft frame of reference. These ions were observed in early orbits during measurements of the neutral density near periapsis, have an erratic and unpredictable signature, and occur at too high an altitude to be due to the neutral atmosphere. When the altitude of periapsis increased above the point where sensible neutral density measurements could be made, the instrument was configured specifically to detect superthermal ions. In general, for orbit numbers 1 to 645, data were taken from the xxxxxx mode. The gas background signal with the filament on is about a factor of 10 less in this mode than in xxxxxx mode, resulting in a lower detection threshold. For orbit numbers above 923, the instrument was deliberately configured with the filament off and xxxxxx mode data was used. For mass 16 the xxxxxx voltage is about xxxxxx volts.	14820

An Estimation Algorithm for Detecting and Reconstructing Optimal Maneuvers from Measurement Residuals	2016-01-01	2018-07-19	This proposed research addresses the problem of optimal maneuver detection and reconstruction with regards to an astrodynamics application. Maneuver detection and reconstruction are processes by which an independent observer may determine when and how a body is moving in a dynamical system under the influence of unmodeled active control. This research shall specifically address the problem of how one can determine and reconstruct orbital maneuvers assuming they are performed optimally with respect to fuel expenditure. This assumption is valid due to limited availability of fuel for space-based missions and how important fuel is to a successful mission.The inevitable goal of this research is produce an estimation algorithm that accounts for the influences of unmodeled optimal control. Essentially, this research is uniting the fields of estimation and optimal control in an algorithm that is applicable to various disciplines. xxxxxx development will involve merging current research in maneuver detection with lessons from various fields of study including astrodynamics, estimation, optimal control, information fusion, and xxxxxx Situational Awareness. The work will primarily be simulation-based, and actual mission data would likely be used to help quantify the algorithms accuracy. Initial work will start by investigating linear estimator algorithms, but eventually the work will be pushed to higher order, xxxxxx filters.Understanding the dynamics of xxxxxx orbital environment is of paramount concern. With the increase in orbital debris from recent collisions, and the increase in launch activity this environment is becoming increasingly crowded. Overcrowding in this environment increases the hazards associated with it due to increased potential for collisions. By gaining a better understanding of the dynamics (both natural and active) associated with this environment we can better pinpoint these potential hazards. xxxxxx such as the one proposed in this paper help reduce the hazards associated with space-based missions, which is imperative to ensuring continued access to xxxxxxorbit and beyond.	14826

Investigating an Instrument for Measurement of Hyperspectral Backscattering in Natural Waters, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	The remote sensing reflectance signal measured by an ocean color satellite is to first order proportional to the ratio of backscattered to absorbed light. Therefore in situ measurements of absorption and backscattering, as functions of wavelength, along with in situ and satellite radiometery, are key to refinement and calibration of legacy ocean color algorithms, as well as development of next generation ocean color products such as phytoplankton functional type. Currently, commercial instruments exist for in situ measurement of the hyperspectral absorption coefficient, but no instrument exists for measurement of the hyperspectral backscattering coefficient.We propose to develop an active sensor for in situ measurement of the hyperspectral backscattering coefficient. We are considering a design based on a broadband white source (chopped), monochromator for varying the source beam wavelength, and hyperspectral detectors (receiving at 2-3 angles) using spectrometers that track the monochromator. There are several configurations of the source, monochromator, spectrometer, and detector that can be considered the aim of the proposed work is to simulate a number of instrument configurations and assess technical and commercial feasibility of such hyperspectral backscattering instrument.The proposed instrument addresses a critical gap in the field of currently available systems for measuring hyperspectral IOPs in situ, in support of hyperspectral ocean color missions.	14829

Rapid Concentration for Improved Detection of Microbes in ISS Potable Water, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	Providing a reliable supply of safe drinking water is a critical requirement for space exploration. xxxxxxs that provide recycled, treated water aboard xxxxxx, & that will supply water aboard future spacecraft, are inherently complex and can be susceptible to biofilm formation and microbial contamination.  Further, it has been noted that pathogenicity and virulence of microbes can increase in microgravity environments. These factors, along with the high consequence of sickness in the remote space environment, make rapid & reliable methods of detecting microbes at low levels a critical need.xxxxxx microbiological detection systems have taken dramatic steps forward in the last two decades and today detection of even a single organism is possible in less than one hour. Unfortunately, development of rapid detection methods has far outpaced development of sample concentration techniques, which are necessary to enable detection of low microbial concentrations in drinking water. Currently, without sample concentration, rapid detection techniques alone produce results that are hundreds to thousands of times less sensitive than the minimum desired detection limit for microbial water contaminates.xxxxxxovaPrep proposes development of a rapid microbial concentration system designed for use aboard xxxxxx. The system will concentrate microbes from up to 5 xxxxxxrs of potable water into volumes as small as 200 &#956;L &#150; providing concentration factors as high as 15,000X.  It will be based on technologies developed and commercialized by xxxxxxovaPrep, but will contain innovations to allow for operation in microgravity. Large volumes of potable water are processed through a hollow fiber membrane filter concentration cell as microbes are captured within the lumen of the fibers. Following capture, the microbes are efficiently eluted using a novel xxxxxx process and then delivered to a rapid detection system for analysis.	14832

SWIFT-nanoLV Avionics Platform, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	With the increased demand for and utility of nano- and micro-satellites, the demand for responsive, low-cost access to space has also increased. To meet this demand, multiple private companies are pursuing the development of nano- and micro-launch vehicles (NMLV). xxxxxxver, NMLV builders lack suitable avionics platforms for both development and operational needs. Traditional launch vehicle avionics platforms exceed the SWaP requirements of an NMLV due to their use of redundant, aerospace grade components. To service the needs of NMLV builders, TUI proposes to develop the SWIFT-nanoLV avionics platform by leveraging its existing portfolio of SWIFT software-defined radios and other small satellite component technologies. Through the careful use of COTS components, modular design techniques, and software-defined architectures, the SWIFT-nanoLV avionics platform will not only meet the SWaP requirements of an NMLV, but will also help minimize the operating costs of xxxxxx. After developing a concept design and testing brassboard prototypes in the xxxxxx I effort, TUI will build and test a fully functional avionics platform in the xxxxxx effort.	14837

The primary capabilities of these products have remained largely unchanged since their initial release. In the analysis and design of modern aerospace vehicles, the deficiencies of these legacy tools are becoming increasingly clear.

Very Low-Cost, Rugged, High-Vacuum System for Mass Spectrometers, Phase II	2012-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx, the DoD, DHS, and commercial industry have a pressing need for miniaturized, rugged, low-cost, high vacuum systems.  Recent advances in sensor technology at xxxxxx and other government laboratories, in academia, and in industry have led to the development of very small mass spectrometer detectors, as well as other analytical instruments needing high vacuum, such as scanning electron microscopes.  xxxxxxver, the vacuum systems to support these sensors remain large, heavy, and power hungry.  To meet this need, Creare proposes to build a miniaturized vacuum system based on a very small, rugged, and inexpensive-to-manufacture, molecular drag pump (MDP).  The MDP is enabled by the development of a miniature, very high-speed (200,000 xxxxxx), rugged, low-power, brushless, DC motor which will be optimized for wide temperature operation and long life during this project.  The vacuum pump has performance that is well matched to the needs of the new generation of miniature analytical instruments.  The pump represents an order-of-magnitude reduction in mass, volume, and cost over current, commercially available, state-of-the-art vacuum pumps.  The new pump will form the heart of a complete vacuum system optimized to support analytical instruments in terrestrial applications as well as on spacecraft and planetary landers.  Furthermore, the miniature high-speed motor will be designed so that it can be used in a wide range of high vacuum pumps, including pure molecular drag, pure turbomolecular, and hybrid turbomolecular/molecular drag pumps that can be tailored to the requirements of specific missions and applications.	14849

Increasingly Autonomous Traffic Flow Management Under Uncertainty, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	Today, traffic managers largely rely on their intuition for making Traffic Management Initiative (TMI) decisions due to lack of decision aids. As a result TMIs are often inefficient and there is a lot of variability in their application across similar situations. xxxxxx 'Similar xxxxxxs in xxxxxx xxxxxx (NAS)' research addresses this issue, but, the research tools produce not a single recommended TMI choice but an array of choices, with the final decision again left to the manager's intuition. The proposed xxxxxx research provides a capability for down-selecting to the most effective TMI choice by developing a what-if analysis functionality for exploring multiple TMI options by realistically simulating NAS-wide operations under the influence of individual TMI options. This what-if analysis capability achieves accurate modeling of NAS traffic flows under uncertainty by creatively integrating two innovations. The first is a traffic flow modeling framework for enabling fast and accurate simulation of individual aircraft transits through the NAS network. This traffic flow modeling framework, which we call the Hybrid Traffic Flow model combines desirable features of trajectory-based models with aggregate traffic flow models to allow fast, near real-time NAS performance evaluation under multiple candidate TMI options. Each option is evaluated under multiple scenarios to capture the whole range of possibilities as per the underlying real world uncertainties,. The second is xxxxxxs for modeling variations caused by underlying NAS uncertainty factors with explicit encoding of human reasoning behind multiple influencing decisions (e.g., Center MIT restriction impositions, airline cancellations), this enables realistic traffic demand and capacity forecasting for feeding the traffic flow model-based TFM evaluations.	14851

In terms of handling hydrogen, conventional rotating mechanical pumps and compressors require extensive modification and have limited reliability. xxxxxxchemical pumping and compression of hydrogen occurs without any moving parts and is highly reliable and efficient. xxxxxx has demonstrated up to 6,000 psi of compression using electrochemical cell hardware. xxxxxxver, for high flow applications, such as a 6 CFM hydrogen pump for xxxxxx, a departure from traditional electrochemical cell hardware designs is needed. Our work in xxxxxx I demonstrated an Expandable xxxxxx Architecture cell design, that allows a large footprint for the electrochemical stack. This is achieved using modular cell parts to create large active area cells. The modular parts are inexpensive to manufacture and can achieve the high tolerances need for large active area cells. The proposed xxxxxx activity will leverage the key developments in xxxxxx I and demonstate the scalability of this device for critical xxxxxx and commercial applications.  This will include increasing the active area/capacity of the electrochemical cell stack by a factor of 5, and to increase pressure capability from 200 psi to 750 psi.  The resultant unit will be utilized to actuate pneumatic tools that could be used in space.	14852
Hybrid Electric Propulsion System for a 4 Passenger VTOL Aircraft, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The advancement of hybrid-electric propulsion systems for rotorcraft enables vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicles to take advantage of aerodynamic efficiencies that can reduce fuel consumption and emissions compared to conventional rotorcraft vehicles.   Unlike conventional internal combustion engines or high speed turbine engines, the high power-to-weight ratio and energy efficiency of electric motors is conserved when the motor is scaled to a smaller size.  A distributed electric propulsion system for a VTOL aircraft can exploit aerodynamic benefits increasing the lift to drag ratio by 4 to 5 times (xxxxxx, Intl xxxxxxed xxxxxx Conf., Aug 2013) compared to that of convectional helicopters.  This can yield a 4x increase in range while maintaining the VTOL and hover capabilities of a conventional helicopter.  Using LaunchPoint Technologies' brushless electric motor optimization software, controller expertise, and battery technology, LaunchPoint proposes to design a hybrid propulsion system for a VTOL aircraft that has an extremely high power-to-weight ratio, to demonstrate the validity of a concept VTOL vehicle.  LaunchPoint Technologies will seek robust system solutions for this hybrid electric propulsion including specifications for motor (propeller) distribution, motor power, lift, drag, a heavy-fuel combustion engine, alternator, battery pack, vehicle range and hover duration.  LaunchPoint will then produce a detailed design of the Auxiliary xxxxxx xxxxxx (combustion engine and alternator), motors, electrical systems, and power control systems for the aircraft.  LaunchPoint will also further develop their dual-xxxxxx array brushless motor technology by building and testing a carbon fiber composite rotor to increase the specific power density of this propulsion system.	14853
Extraterrestrial Metals Processing, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	The Extraterrestrial Metals xxxxxx (EMP) system produces ferrosilicon, silicon monoxide, a glassy mixed oxide slag, and smaller amounts of alkali earth compounds, phosphorus, sulfur, and halogens from xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and asteroid regolith by carbothermal reduction. These materials, in some cases after further processing with other in-situ resources, are used for production of high-purity iron and magnesium metals (for structural applications), high purity silicon (for photovoltaics and semiconductors), high purity silica (for clear glass), refractory ceramics (for insulation, thermal processing consumables, and construction materials), and fertilizer (from phosphorus recovered from carbothermal reduction exhaust gases). xxxxxxthermal reduction also co-produces oxygen at yields on the order of 20 percent of regolith feed mass when integrating downstream processes to recover and recycle carbon. Many of the EMP products can be prepared in a fashion suitable for casting or additive manufacture methods and have broad application in support of advanced human space exploration. The EMP methods are based on minimal reliance on xxxxxxbased consumables; nearly all of the gases and reagents required for processing can be manufactured from xxxxxx in-situ resources or can be recovered and recycled for applications using xxxxxx or asteroid resources.	14854
Precision Foreground Removal in Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization Maps	2020-08-01	2018-07-19	The most promising method for detecting primordial gravitational waves lies in the B-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background, or CMB. A measurement of these B-modes would reveal the first evidence for quantum gravity and determine the energy scale of inflation. xxxxxxver, polarized foreground emission from synchrotron radiation and dust in our galaxy's magnetic field are sources of significant contamination for CMB B-mode polarization maps. I propose to develop high-precision photometric calibration technology in order to make the highest possible quality foreground-cleaned polarization maps of the CMB. I will build and characterize a precision xxxxxx Transform xxxxxx (FTS) with a novel optical coupling scheme that will enable on-site measurements of xxxxxxanced xxxxxxPol's detectors' spectral responses. I will develop new xxxxxxreflection coating technology for optical systems to ensure precise calibration. With my calibration in hand, I will then produce foreground-separated polarization maps which will be used to place constraints on inflation, neutrinos and dark energy. The technology I develop will be applicable to all suborbital and space-based CMB, millimeter wave, and submillimeter wave experiments. My work aligns with xxxxxx goals outlined in the xxxxxx xxxxxxents, Observatories, and xxxxxx xxxxxxs xxxxxx (TA08.1.4 and TA08.2.2), Materials, xxxxxx, Mechanical xxxxxxs, and xxxxxx (TA12.1.4), xxxxxxics of the Cosmos Program, and xxxxxx Program.	14855
640 GHz Heterodyne Polarimeter, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	This proposal is responsive to xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx S1.02: xxxxxx Technologies for xxxxxx, specifically the interest in the development of a 640 GHz xxxxxx with I, Q, U Channels. Suitably compact, light-weight and power efficient heterodyne instruments are required to enable polarimetric measurements for microphysical parameterization of ice clouds applicable to xxxxxx planned xxxxxx, xxxxxx and Ecosystems (ACE) mission. Through the xxxxxx effort, VDI demonstrated the feasibility of an integrated 640 GHz polarimetric receiver. This included the demonstration of a 670 GHz LNA module and an OMT, each being compatible with full integration with the mixer diode based down-convertor. Goals of the xxxxxx include optimization of the OMT, development and evaluation of a fully integrated 670 GHz polarimeter, development of evaluation procedures to ensure the polarimeter meets xxxxxx requirements, and development of a second prototype at 325 GHz to demonstrate the scaling of the technology. The estimated specifications of the 670 GHz prototype include receiver noise temperature ~6,000K (SSB at the horn aperture), power requirement 6W, volume ~1.5 x 1.5 x 0.75. The goal isolation between polarizations is 20 – 25 dB. Both integrated polarimeters will be delivered to xxxxxx GSFC. xxxxxx, VDI will ensure that the technology is extended throughout the frequency range of interest for xxxxxx atmospheric missions, roughly 100 GHz through about 1 THz.	14856
Reduced Order Aeroservoelastic Models with Rigid Body Modes, Phase I	2012-08-01	2018-07-19	Complex aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic phenomena can be modeled on complete aircraft configurations, generating models with millions of degrees of freedom. xxxxxxd order models are used for systems and control analysis.	14857
Frequency-Locked Single-Frequency Fiber Laser at 2 Micron, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx on our proprietary fiber technology and extensive experience in fiber laser development, a new single-frequency 2μm fiber laser source will be developed. The source includes advanced frequency-locking schemes for both center-line locking and offset-frequency locking, so as to address the bandwidth issue associated with airborne and space-borne coherent lidar, i.e., xxxxxx Sensing of xxxxxx Emissions over xxxxxxs, xxxxxxs, and xxxxxx.	14858
Spirally Stowed Architecture for Large Photovoltaic Arrays, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	"Proposed is an architecture for large (>200 m2 surface area) photovoltaic (PV) arrays, deployable from compact stowage with one single, continuously smooth sweep of motion and directly scalable to sizes at least an order of magnitude larger to provide surface areas beyond 4000 m2 -- the area associated with 1 MW power production, the upper limit of projected solar electric propulsion (SEP) needs in 10-20 years.  In particular, examined is the integration of a version of the \"spiral fold\" (an origami-like surface mechanism to wrap without stretching a tessellated sheet on a hub) and wrap rib technology (supporting ribs that also wrap around the hub when stowed) with some additional concept elements to increase stiffness when deployed and the robustness of deployment.  Kinematic conflicts between components with geometric mismatch in a real-life hardware context re resolved, metrics for stowage and structural performance are assessed, and a streadmlined concept design is defined to satisfy all targeted specifications.  xxxxxx level is advanced from 1 to 3."	14859
>1,000 W/kg Rad-Hard, High-Voltage PV Blanket at < $50/W IMM Cell Cost, Phase II	2017-05-01	2018-07-19	The innovation is a new Stretched Lens Array (SLA) with a thinner, lighter, more robust xxxxxx lens (with thin glass or polymer superstrate or embedded aluminum mesh). The new lens enables a blanket-level specific power > 1,000 W/kg, including lenses, PV cell circuit (including cells, encapsulation, high-voltage insulation, and heavy radiation shielding), and waste heat rejection radiator. The new SLA array is cost-effective, with the most expensive array cost element, the IMM solar cell, contributing only $50/W to the array cost. The new lens is novel in configuration, enabling single-axis tracking for the array even in the presence of large beta angles (e.g., 50 degrees) between the array and the sun. For future high-power arrays (e.g., > 100 kW), including xxxxxxar Electric Propulsion (SEP) missions, the new SLA will offer a unique combination of high efficiency (e.g., >35%), ultra-low mass, high-operating voltage (e.g., >300 V), and low cost. SLA technology is a direct descendant of the SCARLET array used to power xxxxxx xxxxxx SEP mission in 1998-2001. SLA recently completed a flight test on TacSat 4 in a very high radiation orbit, and the lessons learned from TacSat 4 led to the new SLA, the subject of this proposal. The new SLA is scalable to multi-hundred-kW array sizes using blanket deployment and support platforms such as DSS's Roll-Out xxxxxxar Array (ROSA). The new SLA will typically operate at 4X concentration, saving substantially on solar cell area, cost, radiation shielding mass, and dielectric isolation mass. The new SLA will enable the early use of state-of-the-art cells, such as inverted metamorphic (IMM) cells with 4 or 6 junctions, and will enhance the production capacity of cell vendors (e.g., 100 kW per year of 1 sun cells = 400 kW per year of 4X cells). The feasibility of the new SLA was firmly established in xxxxxx I, and fully functional prototype hardware will be developed and tested by MOLLC, DSS, xxxxxx, and CFE in xxxxxx.	14860

Reduced Order Modeling for Aeroservoelastic Control and Analysis (RACA), Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx and other government agencies have been plagued by aeroelasticity of aircraft structures for a long time. The traditional approach has been to build stiff structures for suppressing aeroelastic effects. xxxxxxver, the increase in computational technology has enabled a careful analysis of aeroelastic effects, and design of lightweight structures. xxxxxxver, a direct CFD-CSD coupling is still too expensive to be used for control simulations and design. To address this critical need, IAI is developing reduced order models to capture the necessary physics, while enabling much more efficient computation. Our RACA approach will systematically study ROM technology and develop the appropriate methods for our particular application of interest – supersonic low-boom aircraft. We will develop a full-fledged aeroelastic analysis framework as well, to provide simulation-based verification results. The ROMs developed will then be used for control system design and demonstration of adaptive control technologies for advanced flexible aircraft.	14862
Efficient Composite Repair Methods for Launch Vehicles, Phase I	2018-06-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx matrix composites are increasingly replacing traditional metallic materials in xxxxxx launch vehicles.   xxxxxxver, the repair and subsequent inspection methods for these materials are considerably more complicated.  Typically, a composite laminate patch must be manually fabricated and bonded or co-cured to the damaged structure.  To ensure high quality patches with sufficient compaction and low void content, significant time, preparation and equipment is required.  Current surface preparations require time consuming labor and can be a risk for further damage.  The ideal repair methodology would allow for a rapid structural repair to be performed on-site in locations with minimal access and without the need for extensive tooling, surface prep, cure times and complicated inspection techniques. xxxxxxs at Luna have developed a number of technologies that have the potential to enable high performance composite repair and inspection during pre-launch ground processing. Luna's comprehensive system will realize improvements via facile surface preparation, reduction of specialized fabrication equipment, rapid-on-demand curing resins and utilization of Luna's unique fiber optic measurement capability for monitoring repair state. This xxxxxx I program will focus on developing these methods for composite damage that can be performed during ground processing of the launch vehicle without the need for full replacement	14863
Improvement in Space Food Packaging Methods	2012-08-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx Food xxxxxxs xxxxxx&#39;s (SFSL) current Bulk Overwrap Bag (BOB) package, while simple and effective, leaves room for improvement. Currently, BOBs are sized&nbsp;to fit in Cargo Transfer Bags (CTB). On orbit, however, the pantry setup utilizes several Collapsible US Food Containers (CUFC). In addition, the entirety of the menu must be overwrapped with an aluminum laminate package in order to meet the oxygen and water vapor permeability requirements of an 18 month shelf life requirement. The development of a xxxxxx BOB could alleviate several or all of these issues in a cost, mass, and volume sensitive manner by changing the size and shape of the BOB as well as potentially finding an alternative material with sufficient barrier properties to eliminate the secondary overwraps.	14864
Development of a Cathode Liquid Feed Electrolyzer to Generate 3,600 PSI Oxygen for Both Lunar and Space Microgravity Environments, Phase II	2013-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxxchemical xxxxxxs (GES) proposes to develop a cathode liquid feed, proton-exchange membrane electrolyzer stack and system capable of producing 3,600 psi oxygen.  We propose to subcontract xxxxxx-xxxxxx Human xxxxxx xxxxxxs (H-S) to share unique state-of-the-art technologies that provide the best path to meeting program objectives.  GES will share their data and expertise with high balanced pressure electrolyzers and H-S will contribute their data and expertise in high differential pressure electrolyzer systems. xxxxxx on the high pressure anode design concept developed in xxxxxx I, GES will further develop the electrolyzer cell and stack design.  In parallel, H-S will develop the key subsystem and control components for a brassboard balance of plant.  The program will culminate in the fabrication, assembly, and demonstration of a brassboard high oxygen pressure generation system.	14865
VOYAGER 2 SAT LOW ENERGY CHARGED PARTICLE CALIB. BR 15MIN	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	THIS BROWSE DATA CONSISTS OF RExxxxxxLED DATA FROM THE LOW ENERGY CHARxxxxxx PARTICLE (LECP) EXPERIMENT ON VOYAGER 2 WHILE THE SPACECRAFT WAS IN THE VICINITY OF xxxxxxURN. THIS INSTRUMENT MEASURES THE INTENSITIES OF IN-SITU CHARxxxxxx PARTICLES (>26 KEV ELECTRONS AND >30 KEV IONS) WITH VARIOUS LEVELS OF DISCRIMIxxxxxxION BASED ON ENERGY, MASS SPECIES, AND ANGULAR ARRIVAL DIRECTION. A SUBSET OF ALMOST 100 LECP CHANNELS ARE INCLUDED WITH THIS DATA SET. THE LECP DATA ARE GLOBALLY CAxxxxxxTED TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE (SEE BELOW) AND THEY ARE TIME AVERAxxxxxx TO ABOUT 15 MINUTE TIME INTERVALS WITH THE EXxxxxxx BEGINNING AND ENDING TIMES FOR THOSE INTERVALS MATCHING THE LECP INSTRUMENTAL CYCLE PERIODS (THE ANGULAR SCANNING PERIODS). THE LECP INSTUMENT HAS A ROTATING HEAD FOR OBTAINING ANGULAR ANISOTROPY MEASUREMENTS OF THE xxxxxx ENERGY CHARxxxxxx PARTICLES THAT IT MEASURES. THE CYCLE TIME FOR THE ROTATION IF VARIABLE, BUT DURING ENCOUNTERS IT IS ALWAYS FASTER THAN 15 MINUTES. FOR THIS BROWSE DATA SET ONLY SCAN AVERAGE DATA IS GIVEN (NO ANGULAR INFORMATION). THE DATA IS IN THE FORM OF 'RATE' DATA WHICH HAS NOT BEEN CONVERTED TO THE USUAL PHYSICAL UNITS. THE REASON IS THAT SUCH A CONVERSION WOULD DEPEND ON UNCERTAIN DETERMIxxxxxxIONS SUCH AS THE MASS SPECIES OF THE PARTICLES AND THE LEVEL OF BACKGROUND. BOTH MASS SPECIES AND BACKGROUND ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED FROM CONTEXT DURING THE STUDY OF PARTICULAR REGIONS. TO CONVERT 'RATE' TO 'INTENSITY' FOR A PARTICULAR CHANNEL ONE PERFORMS THE FOLLOWING TASKS: 1) DECIDE ON THE LEVEL OF BACKGROUND CONTAMIxxxxxxION AND xxxxxx THAT OFF THE GIVEN RATE LEVEL. BACKGROUND IS TO BE DETERMINED FROM CONTEXT AND FROM MAKING USE OF SECTOR 8 RATES (SECTOR 8 HAS A 2 mm AL SHIELD COVERING IT). 2) xxxxxxIDE THE BACKGROUND CORRECTED RATE BY THE CHANNEL GEOMETRIC xxxxxxxxxxOR AND BY THE ENERGY BANxxxxxxS OF THE CHANNEL. THE GEOMETRIC xxxxxxxxxxOR IS FOUND IN ENTRY 'channel_geometric_ factor' AS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH CHANNEL 'channel_id'. TO DETERMINE THE ENERGY BANxxxxxxS, ONE MUST JUDGE THE MASS SPECIES OF THE OF THE DETECTED PARTICLES (FOR IONS BUT NOT FOR ELECTRONS). THE ENERGY BAND PASSES ARE GIVEN IN ENTRIES 'minimum_instrument_parameter' and 'maximum_instrument_ parameter' IN TABLE 'FPLECPENERGY', AND ARE GIVEN IN THE FORM 'ENERGY/NUCLEON'. FOR CHANNELS THAT BEGIN THEIR NAMES WITH THE DESIGxxxxxxIONS 'CH' THESE BANxxxxxxSES CAN BE USED ON MASS SPECIES THAT ARE xxxxxxED INTO THAT CHANNEL (SEE ENTRIES 'minimum_instrument_parameter' and 'maximum_instrument_ parameter' IN TABLE 'xxxxxx', WHICH GIVE THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM 'Z' VALUE xxxxxxED -- THESE ENTRIES ARE BLANK FOR ELECTRON CHANNELS). FOR OTHER CHANNELS THE GIVEN BANxxxxxxS REFERS ONLY TO THE LOWEST 'Z' VALUE xxxxxxED. THE BANxxxxxxSES FOR OTHER 'Z' VALUES ARE NOT ALL KNOWN, BUT SOME ARE GIVEN IN THE LITERATURE (E.G. KRIMIGIS ET AL., 1979). THE FINAL PRODUCT OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE THE PARTICLE INTENSITY WITH THE UNITS: COUNTS/(CM**2.STR.SEC.KEV). SOME CHANNELS ARE SUBJECT TO SERIOUS CONTAMIxxxxxxIONS, AND MANY OF THESE CONTAMIxxxxxxIONS CANNOT BE REMOVED EXCEPT WITH A REGION-BY-REGION ANALYSIS, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN DONE FOR THIS DATA. THUS, TO USE THIS DATA IT IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL THAT THE CONTAMIxxxxxxION TYPES ('contamination_id' , 'contamination_desc') AND THE LEVELS OF CONTAMIxxxxxxION ('data_quality_id' CORRESPONDING TO THE DEFINITIONS 'data_quality_desc') BE CAREFULLY EXAMINED FOR ALL REGIONS OF STUDY. A DEAD TIME CORRECTION PxxxxxxEDURE HAS BEEN APPLIED IN AN ATTEMPT TO CORRECT THE LINEAR EFFECTS OF DETECTOR OVExxxxxxIVE (PULSE-PILEUP). THIS PxxxxxxEDURE DOES NOT FIX SEVERELY OVExxxxxxIVEN DETECTORS. A PxxxxxxEDURE IS AVAILABLE FOR CORRECTING VOYAGER 2 LECP ELECTRON CONTAMIxxxxxxION OF LOW ENERGY ION CHANNELS, BUT ITS EFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN EVALUATED ONLY FOR THE URANUS DATA SET. THUS, CORRECTIONS HAVE BEEN APPLIED ONLY TO THE URANUS DATA SET.	14866

Novel Ultra-Miniature LIDAR Scanner for Launch Range Data Collection, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	LIDAR (xxxxxx xxxxxxion and xxxxxx) technology plays important roles in xxxxxx space missions. Specifically in KSC's launch vehicles operations, break-through in LIDAR technology could provide ability to economically measure incremental ballistic wind velocities along the predicted trajectory of launch vehicles at remote.  The most critical component in a LIDRA is its laser scanner, which delivers laser pulse to target with desirable field of view (FOV).  Most of existing LIDARs uses rotating or oscillating mirror for scanning, resulting in several drawbacks:• Large size of moving parts (mirrors and motors), limiting scanning speed to hundreds HZ; • Difficult to meet stringent requirements on size, weight, and power for space uses;• Difficult to control FOV of scanning motion;• Un-evenness of data point distribution due to inherent acceleration of scanning mirror;• xxxxxx points at the swath borders of scanning mirror.       In this xxxxxx, we propose a revolutionary LIDAR scanning technology  that could eliminate these drawbacks and achieve very high scanning speed, with an ultra-miniature size, much lighter weight and much compact size. This novel technology promises at least a 10x performance improvement in these areas over existing LIDAR scanners.xxxxxxovations of the proposed ultra-miniature LIDAR scanner include:• xxxxxx miniature size of scanner: it is possible to make the entire scanner in <2 mm in diameter;• Very high scanning speed (e.g. 5~20 kHz, contrast to several hundred Hz in existing scanners);• Ideal structure to meet stringent requirements on size, weight, power, and compactness for various space applications;• The scanning speed and field of view (FOV) can be dynamically adjusted: suited for obtaining high image resolutions of targeted areas and for diversified uses.	14869

A high-fidelity &ldquo;brassboard&rdquo;, or proto-flight packaged version of the xxxxxx-proposed Precision xxxxxx Molecular Analyzer (PRISMA) deep UV laser required for the xxxxxx-funded LITMS (xxxxxxar Ion Trap xxxxxx xxxxxx) instrument as well as at least one xxxxxx instrument proposal, laser will be built and tested in this effort; lessons learned from our FY14 IRAD will be incorporated into the design of the optical train implemented between the pump fiber and output window, based on our lessons learned in FY14 breadboard, and other flight laser efforts, where costs, complexity, and risks will be held to the absolute minimum. &nbsp;The PRISMA LITMS laser consists of three sections:&nbsp; a Q-switched oscillator, an electro-optic (EO) attenuator, and a nonlinear frequency conversion stage.&nbsp; Like the MLA, LOLA, and GLAS oscillators, PRISMA LITMS will utilize xxxxxxYAG as the gain medium with a xxxxxx passive Q-switch to achieve high peak power (~1 MW) pulsed output.&nbsp; The laser is end-pumped by a fiber-coupled diode laser, which allows for a compact laser cavity (&lt;5 cm) and remote location of the pump diode and associated control electronics to be placed virtually anywhere on the instrument deck.&nbsp; The xxxxxxYAG laser crystal has a 2 mm undoped YAG chip, diffusion-bonded to one end to minimize pump-induced thermal distortions, enhance alignment stability, and reduce the total part count.&nbsp; The oscillator stage produces 1064 nm laser pulses (&gt;1.3 mJ) in short temporal widths (&lt;3 ns) in bursts of up to 100 Hz.&nbsp; These 1064 nm pulses are sent through a pair of specialized non-linear conversion crystals to produce a final output exceeding 250 uJ at 266 nm and ~ 1ns.&nbsp; This is the radiation to be directed to the xxxxxx soil sample for a LDMS measurement.&nbsp; xxxxxxver, something yet to be demonstrated, (to our knowledge) is the ability to produce these pulses in a burst-mode fashion, as well as adjust the individual pulse energy, with no effect on pointing or beam quality.&nbsp; We will achieve this precision 266 nm pulse, as required by the PRISMA MSLITMS science, with an EO attenuation stage ilocated after the laser oscillator and the frequency conversion section.&nbsp; This EO Attenuator (EOA) consists of an RTP Pockel&#39;s cell and polarizing beam splitter (PBS) cube, which are used in concert as an active throttle for the 1064 nm pulses entering the nonlinear conversion stage.&nbsp; Finally, all the components and materials are selected from the published or demonstrated list of&nbsp; &ge;xxxxxx.The oscillator, currently in laboratory breadboard state, is operating to specifications and will be repackaged into a proto-flight engineering unit for mission performance testing and optimization.&nbsp; The initial hardware enclosure design concept is complete, seen in xxxxxxure 1, and will be optimized for mass and size reduction.&nbsp; Due to the extreme impact mass has on cost for any xxxxxx rover hardware, we will focus intently on demonstrating an extremely compact design for environmental testing.&nbsp;	14871
Novel Catalyst Development for Synthetic Endothermic Fuels, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxical xxxxxxs xxxxxxorporated (PSI) and xxxxxxed Technologies xxxxxx (xxxxxxC) propose to develop, characterize, and evaluate the performance of innovative nanocatalysts that are homogeneously dispersed (0.01 % - 0.1 % by wt.) within a synthetic endothermic hydrocarbon fuel for ramjet, scramjet, and xxxxxx-xxxxxx xxxxxxd-Cycle (RBCC) applications.  Coke build-up will be significantly reduced since the catalyst will be expelled with the product gases and liquids from the cracking system into the combustion zone.  xxxxxxreased cracking efficiencies will result using the nanocatalyst due to the higher surface area/volume and dramatically enhanced settling times compared to conventional microcatalysts.  As a result, higher heat sinks due to endothermic cracking will be obtained.  The reaction product distribution and efficiencies of the nanocatalytic hydrocarbon cracking reaction will be measured using standard chromatography methods.  Use of the alternative synthetic fuel is advantageous due to its low sulfur content, high thermal stability, high endotherm, and production through a non-petroleum based reaction.  In xxxxxx, new nanocatalysts will be synthesized, characterized, and tested. Catalytic efficiency will be optimized.  The implications of the nanocatalyst on combustion performance will be evaluated.  This program comprises xxxxxxs 1 through 3 within xxxxxx.	14872
Hybrid Direct Drive PPU for Deep Space CubeSat Propulsion System, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx proposes to develop an innovative, hybrid direct-drive (HDD) xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx (PPU) for CubeSat electric propulsion (EP) systems. The technological approach is an adaptation of a xxxxxx patented technology, US patent number 8,550,405, entitled \"xxxxxxar xxxxxxed xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx for a xxxxxx xxxxxx.\" This technology will immediately benefit the deep space 6U CubeSat currently being developed under xxxxxx \"xxxxxxCube\" program, which is equipped with xxxxxx's groundbreaking, iodine-fueled RF ion thruster BIT-3.  The HDD concept will take advantage of the solar array's raw voltage, which is much higher than the conditioned voltages typically supplied by the spacecraft's electrical power system (xxxxxx), and directly feeds it into the propulsion system's PPU to minimize efficiency losses during high-voltage conversion.  The end result is increased available power for thruster utilization, which in turn can help maximize the vehicle's thrust, specific impulse (xxxxxx) and delta-V maneuverability during the continuous-thrusting phase of the mission.  Operating the ion thruster at higher power will ultimately help reduce time spent on trajectory transfer, thus saving mission operation costs and lessening burden on electronics in high radiation environments.In typical Cube-Sat systems the bus voltage is quite low.  This requires additional power conditioning using step up DC/DC converters when high voltages are needed (such as the grids on the BIT-3 RF ion thruster).  In the proposed approach the HDD unit conditions the high voltage directly from the solar array and passes it to the PPU, thus eliminating redundant power processing of step up converters and improving system efficiency.  This topology also offers the novel feature of thruster dependent peak power tracking, providing direct control of the power flow from the arrays to the PPU by throttling the thruster."	14873

Networked ATM for Efficient Routing, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx in weather forecasts and traffic congestion sometimes result in inefficient planned flight paths for aircraft operating in xxxxxx xxxxxx (NAS). Over the past several years, xxxxxx developed two decision support tools to identify opportunities for efficient re-routes. The Dynamic Weather Routing (DWR) system uses information generated on the ground to identify candidate flights for re-routing and the airline operations center (AOC) sends the proposed change to the flight deck for subsequent negotiation with air traffic control (ATC). The Traffic Aware Strategic Aircrew Requests (TAxxxxxx) system is flight deck-based, using information available on the aircraft and software in the electronic flight bag (EFB) to suggest alternative routes. DWR successfully completed operational tests at ZFW and xxxxxxn Airlines and TAxxxxxx will soon begin operational evaluations at xxxxxx Airlines and Virgin xxxxxx.Our concept proposes a more capable architecture that can take full advantage of emerging communications technologies to integrate AOC and flight deck capabilities. This approach offers a more robust, extensible architecture that can be tailored to an individual airline's operational model while simultaneously offering an upgrade path for adding more capability over time. Our solution aims to combine the best features of DWR and TAxxxxxx and adds more capability via enhanced data communications. Our solution fully integrates with the AOC but retains full access to the superior information from the flight deck. This enables our architecture to use the best available data, allocate data processing and analytical functions to where they can be performed most efficiently, and allows the airline to choose where it wants decision making to occur.	14877
Printable Spacecraft: Flexible Electronic Platforms for NASA Missions	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	Is it possible to print a spacecraft on a sheet of paper? This study fuses several existing technologies to enable printable spacecraft, including printable batteries, electronics, and sensors. Atmospheric confetti. xxxxxxhworm crawlers. Blankets of ground penetrating radar. These are some of the unique mission concepts which are enabled by a printable spacecraft. Flexible printed electronics is a wide-ranging technology that can enhance or even enable many engineering applications. Our concept is to utilize the commercial technology of printed electronics to design and fabricate an entire end to end functional spacecraft. The novel advancement (and therefore the technical challenge) of the concept is to apply printed electronics in a multi-functional platform by implementing every subsystem that a spacecraft might need from the scientific sensor through the data downlink and have it survive and function in a space environment. These requirements push the current state of the art for functionality as well as introduce design and manufacturing compatibility challenges among the functional subsystems. Current industry growth and commercial investment is expected to advance the functionality of available basic building blocks and components synergistically with xxxxxx&rsquo;s needs.	14878

A Comprehensive CFD Tool for Aerothermal Environment Around Space Vehicles, Phase II	2012-11-01	2018-07-19	The goal of this xxxxxx project is to develop an innovative, high fidelity computational tool for accurate prediction of aerothermal environment around space vehicles. This tool will be based on the Unified Flow xxxxxxver (UFS) developed at CFDRC for hybrid simulations of rarefied, transitional and continuum flows. In this project, UFS will be enhanced to include: radiation transport, non-equilibrium chemistry with real gas effects, and weakly-ionized plasma. The unique strengths of our proposal are: (i) smart software with self-aware physics and adaptive numerics for hypersonic flows with non-equilibrium chemistry, (ii) direct Boltzmann solvers for charged and neutral particles in rarefied regimes, and (iii) a high-fidelity multi-scale radiation transport model that can handle orders of magnitude variation of optical thickness. During xxxxxx, we evaluated the relevant physical models and numerical algorithms, and started initial implementation and demonstration of the new capabilities. In xxxxxx 2, these capabilities will be fully developed, validated and demonstrated for selected benchmark problems of interest to xxxxxx. The proposed tool will significantly upgrade the modeling fidelity of high-speed weakly-ionized flows of molecular gases, and enable computational investigation of innovative hypersonic plasma technologies.	14881
Magnetic Active Radiation Shielding System Using Helmholtz Coil Lattices	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	The objective of this proposal is to investigate whether a magnetic active radiation shielding systems can be designed from an optics perspective, where Helmholtz coil lattices act as a magnetic lenses that deflect high energy particles away from a spacecraft. Preliminary calculations show that a unidirectional magnetic field generated with Helmholtz coil lattices can be optimized to achieve the minimum level of deflection required to effectively shield against particles of normal incidence within the GCR energy spectrum. Unfortunately this preliminary analysis is far from complete, and doesn’t incorporate multiple angles of incidence. It does, however, beg the question of whether extremely large magnetic fields are required to provide an adequate level of deflection. With this idea in mind, this proposal aims to address the following research questions:1) What is the optimal magnetic field configuration for use in a radiation shielding2) Can this optimal magnetic field configuration be implemented using Helmholtz coil lattices3) Can a magnetic active radiation shield be optimized to an extent that it no longer requires the use of high temperature superconductorsThis is different from previous active shielding approaches in that it isn’t contingent upon the use of high temperature superconductors and large magnetic fields. With that said, its purpose isn’t intended to be in direct opposition to high temperature superconductor approaches. Determining an optimal field configuration would be beneficial regardless of whether its implemented with superconductors.	14882
Compact Laser for In-Situ Compositional Analysis, Phase II	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	In response to xxxxxx solicitation for light-weight and power efficient instruments that enable in situ compositional analysis, xxxxxx in partnership with the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx proposes to develop a compact, robust, and efficient instrument to combine all laser based spectroscopies capable of performing imaging, xxxxxx, xxxxxx Induced Breakdown, xxxxxx Induced xxxxxx and LIDAR  The main advantage in using this suite of instruments is the collection of information from imaging to elemental composition of rock samples by simply directing a laser beam on remote targets of interest.  xxxxxx on the success of the current xxxxxx rover instrument ChemCam, the first ever laser-based spectrographic system to be selected as an instrument on a xxxxxx spacecraft, the xxxxxx Institute of xxxxxxics and xxxxxxetology (HIGP) has developed and tested a prototype instrument. This new instrument is capable of at least 10,000 times greater sensitivity than the ChemCam instrument, allowing faster measurements up to 8 m away with a focused laser beam. This integrated, compact remote instrument is called the Compact integrated instrument for xxxxxx xxxxxxscopy xxxxxx (xxxxxx). Replacing the existing laser with the xxxxxx proposed laser will reduce xxxxxx's weight by 30 % and volume by 20 %.In xxxxxx, xxxxxx will design, develop and build a laser that will produce 5 mJ of energy in < 2 ns pulse duration at 523 nm and our partner HIGP will further develop compact and high resolution spectrograph.  Both laser and spectrograph will be integrated into the xxxxxx instrument to make it lightweight, compact and efficient.  We will detect organic and inorganic sample at 10 m standoff distance in xxxxxx environment, earth atmospheric pressure, daylight.	14883

Ultra-low Noise, High Bandwidth, 1550nm HgCdTe APD, Phase II	2007-01-01	2018-07-19	To meet the demands of future high-capacity free space optical communications links, a high bandwidth, near infrared (NIR), single photon sensitive optoelectronic receiver will be designed, manufactured, and demonstrated. The unique vertical charge transport electron avalanche photodiode (EAPD) exploits the bandgap properties of xxxxxx to achieve high quantum efficiency and avalanche multiplication that preferentially ionizes electrons to achieve nearly noiseless gain exceeding 1000 with an excess noise factor approaching 1.0 and bandwidths greater than 500 MHz. In xxxxxx, a segmented 1 mm x 1 mm back-illuminated detector will be integrated with a low noise CMOS integrated circuit to realize a photoreceiver capable of both single photon detection and photon number discrimination. Unlike xxxxxx detectors, the receiver can operate at 77K, without the limitations of afterpulsing, so that dark current can de reduced and bit errors rates reduced. A cold laser line filter is used to select the spectral response anywhere within the 1064-2400 nm spectral band. xxxxxxical communications has been identified as a critical technology for future xxxxxx missions, and the innovation satisfied the currently unmet need for a single photon sensitive, large area, high bandwidth NIR photoreceivers that is not served by contemporary approaches.	14886

Combining our data with the data from Rousselot et. al. 2003, we derive a synodic period of 15.382+/-0.001hr in agreement with the period from Rousselot et. al. 2003. Our observations show no evidence of a coma.	14888
Use of the Mars Atmosphere To Improve Performance of Supersonic Retropropulsion	2017-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxs and rovers have been critical for the exploration of xxxxxx. While past missions have been successful, we are reaching the extent of what we can land on xxxxxx using incremental advances of Viking-technology, placing limitations on the mass, landing location and accuracy of the entry vehicle. In order to send more massive rovers to xxxxxx it is necessary that we develop new technologies to increase our atmospheric entry and landing capabilities. This is needed in order to enable future human-precursor and human-scale missions to xxxxxx possible technology to enable future high mass missions to xxxxxx is the use of Supersonic Retropropulsion (SRP). SRP involves using thrusters directed in opposition to the oncoming airflow to decelerate the entry vehicle while it is traveling at supersonic speeds. Because of the propellant and oxidizer mass required for the additional thrusters, currently proposed SRP configurations require a significant increase in performance and efficiency before they can be considered an effective solution for xxxxxx missions. A possible means to improve SRP performance and mass-efficiency is the use of an atmospheric-breathing propulsion system for the SRP thrusters. An atmospheric-breathing propulsion system, unlike a conventional rocket propulsion system, does not carry the oxidizer within the craft itself. It instead ingests the oxidizer from the surrounding atmosphere and combines it with the fuel carried onboard to create thrust. Because the oxidizer is not carried within the vehicle this significantly reduces the mass and volume requirements of the entry system. In the case of a xxxxxx lander, this oxidizer would have to be carried throughout the entirety of the mission (from Earth departure until xxxxxx descent); as such, its elimination from the vehicle may result in a significant performance advantage. A significant challenge with using an atmospheric-breathing propulsion system on xxxxxx is that the xxxxxx atmosphere consists largely of xxxxxx, not air. Thus, traditional oxygen combustion is not possible. Instead, innovative combustion techniques need to be developed that allow for combustion using xxxxxx as an oxidizer. The initial feasibility of such systems has been demonstrated such as the production of thrust from the combustion of xxxxxx powder and other fuels with xxxxxx. These initial efforts demonstrate that an atmospheric-breathing SRP system on an xxxxxx, xxxxxx and xxxxxxding (EDL) vehicle may be possible. The objective of this project is to design and demonstrate the feasibility of an atmospheric-breathing supersonic retropropulsion descent system for use on a xxxxxx entry vehicle. The resulting descent system would effectively integrate three technological developments: supersonic retropropulsion, atmospheric-breathing propulsion and xxxxxx based combustion in an integrated vehicle design process. xxxxxxment of the integrated system will involve propulsion and vehicle design to first develop a feasible atmospheric-breathing propulsion system utilizing the xxxxxx atmosphere and second, integrate that system within an entry vehicle as a cohesive and robust EDL system. This involves designing a configuration that is able to efficiently collect the xxxxxx atmosphere and transport it to the thrusters while maintaining a thruster configuration that provides sufficient deceleration and control throughout the descent. Supporting the system design will be computational analysis in addition to small-scale experimental work. The advantage of this integrated EDL solution is to increase the current capabilities of xxxxxx landers so that they can achieve a wider range of landing sites, land with greater precision and land higher mass payloads The descent system will be designed to support high mass payloads and enable future human-scale missions to xxxxxx.	14889

Wrapped-MLI: Thermal Insulation for Cryogenic Piping, Phase II	2013-05-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxx vehicles (EDS, xxxxxxn, landers & orbiting fuel depots) need improved cryogenic propellant transfer & storage for long duration missions.  Current cryogen feed line xxxxxx-xxxxxx Insulation (MLI) performance is 10X worse per area than tank MLI insulation.   xxxxxxgenic piping heat leak is 50  80% of cryotank heat leak, and 40  50% of xxxxxx is lost - about 150,000 gallons ($300,000) - during transfer, chill down & ground hold during each STS launch.   xxxxxx Product xxxxxxment, teaming with xxxxxx, proposes to continue development of an innovative advanced insulation system, xxxxxx, which could provide improved thermal insulation for cryogenic feed lines.xxxxxx (wMLI) is high performance multilayer insulation designed for cryogenic piping that uses xxxxxx's innovative discrete spacer technology to control layer spacing/density and reduce heat leak. The xxxxxx I program successfully proved wMLI feasibility by designing, building and testing a wMLI prototype with a measured heat leak 3.6X lower than spiral-wrapped conventional MLI widely used for piping insulation. A wMLI prototype had a heat leak of 7.3 W/m2, or 27% of the heat leak of conventional MLI (26.7 W/m2). xxxxxx estimates the thermal performance of wMLI could be further improved by 3-fold, leading to a heat leak of 0.7 W/m2 (20 layers, 77K to 295K), and even larger advantages over conventional MLI piping insulation. In a xxxxxx program we would further develop wMLI technology with custom, molded polymer spacers, and advance the product toward commercialization via a rigorous testing program including developing advanced vacuum insulated pipe for GSE application. wMLI could provide advanced cryogen transfer line insulation and be the basis of a superior xxxxxx Insulated Pipe technology.	14892
High-Fidelity Prediction of Launch Vehicle Lift-off Acoustic Environment, Phase II	2018-03-01	2018-07-19	Launch vehicles experience extreme acoustic loads during liftoff driven by the interaction of rocket plumes and plume-generated acoustic waves with ground structures. Currently employed predictive capabilities are too dissipative to accurately resolve the propagation of waves throughout the launch environment. Higher fidelity non-dissipative analysis tools are critically needed to design mitigation measures (such as water deluge) and launch pad geometry for current and future xxxxxx and commercial launch vehicles. This project will develop and deliver breakthrough technologies to drastically improve acoustic loads predictions. An innovative hybrid CFD and Computational Aeroacoustics (CFD/CAA) method will be developed where established RANS/LES modeling will be used for predicting the acoustic generation physics, and a high-order accurate unstructured discontinuous xxxxxx (DG) method will be employed to propagate acoustic waves across large distances using ideally suited high-order accurate schemes. This new paradigm enables: (1) xxxxxx fidelity over linear methods; (2) Greatly reduced numerical dissipation and dispersion; and (3) xxxxxx acoustics modeling for attenuation, diffraction, and reflection from complex geometry. A proof-of-concept was developed and successfully demonstrated during xxxxxx I for benchmark applications as well as SLS prototype model launch environments. xxxxxx will deliver production CFD/CAA predictive capabilities with 4th-order spatial and temporal accuracy for near lossless acoustic propagation throughout the launch environment, which will provide xxxxxx engineers with more than a two-fold increase in the range of resolvable frequencies over current methods.	14893
Development of SuperHERO readout electronics	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	Next-generation solar hard X-ray (HXR) imagers will make high-sensitivity, high-dynamic-range observations of the signatures of accelerated electrons in solar eruptive events.&nbsp; Accordingly, their detectors, with associated readout electronics, must meet the requirements of spatial resolution, spectral resolution, and count rates for observing high-energy X-ray emission emitted from accelerated electrons.&nbsp; We will build off of ongoing development efforts to design readout electronics that can be used in flight. The SuperHERO balloon mission concept is the next step in solar hard X-ray (~20&ndash;80 keV) instrumentation following the successful HEROES balloon mission, which launched in xxxxxxember 2013.&nbsp; As with HEROES, SuperHERO is a collaboration between GSFC and MSFC, and uses grazing-incidence hard X-ray optics to focus X-rays onto position-sensitive detectors.&nbsp; HEROES used gas proportional scintillation counters, but the improved angular resolution of the optics on SuperHERO and the scientific benefits of increased effective area and throughput motivates a switch to state-of-the-art pixelated solid-state detectors.The High Energy X-ray Imaging xxxxxx (HEXITEC) pixelated xxxxxx detectors developed by the xxxxxxor xxxxxxment Group at xxxxxx (RAL) are uniquely capable of satisfying all the requirements for solar X-ray imaging.&nbsp; They provide pixel sizes 2x smaller than any other comparable energy-sensitive detectors (250x250 um pixel pitch), have large numbers of pixels per detector (80x80, can be tiled to 160x160), and can handle 10,000 counts per second per pixel while maintaining an energy resolution of ~0.5 keV down to soft X-ray energies of 3 keV.We are building off of ongoing development efforts to design readout electronics that can be used in flight, such as for SuperHERO.&nbsp; This effort is the next stage in an ongoing effort to build a hard X-ray detector system that can be used on future sub-orbital or spacecraft missions.&nbsp; The ongoing development efforts have been funded by the IRAD program in collaboration with MSFC and RAL.&nbsp; The developed and tested design for the readout electronics design can then be used on the next funded mission (e.g., balloon or sounding rocket instrument).	14894
Removing Mid-Spatial Frequency (MSF) Errors Using Stress-Polishing	2013-10-01	2018-07-19	After diamond-turning aluminum aspheric mirrors, we will develop a stressed polishing process to improve surface figure and finish.This IRAD proposes to evaluate how stress polishing can be used to extend the application of super-polishing to fast aspheres and freeforms, removing sub-aperture MSF errors, such as tool marks, from diamond-turned aluminum optics.  It will leverage an old technique for manufacturing aspheres—stress polishing with a large tool. The aspheric surface will be generated using small tool manufacturing techniques. After the asphere is generated, a mechanical load will be placed onto the optic to deform the asphere into a sphere, using an interferometer to fine tune the deformation.  After the asphere is deformed into a sphere, the sub-aperture tool marks can be removed by post-polishing using the xxxxxx super-polishing process, a process limited to spheres and flats due to the fact that it requires the use of a tight fitting large polishing tool.	14895

Novel Design of Orifice Type Control Element for Mitigating Instabilities, Phase II	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	An orifice element is commonly used in liquid rocket engine test facilities to provide a large reduction in pressure over a very small distance in the piping system.  Orifice elements are used in propellant lines, feed systems, plume suppression systems and steam ejector trains. While the orifice as a device is largely effective in stepping down pressure, it is also susceptible to a wake-vortex type instability and cavitation instability that propagate downstream and interact with other elements of the test facility resulting in structural vibration. In this proposal a new proprietary instability mitigation device has been developed that steps down  the pressure, straightens the flow and suppresses all instability modes. The device is scalable and can be used for different mass flow rates and varying levels of de-pressurization conditions. It is relatively inexpensive to manufacture, easy to fabricate and install, and can be tailored to meet the performance requirements of a given facility. In xxxxxx I, the device has been successfully demonstrated in a sub-scale cryogenic test facility. In xxxxxx the performance of the device will be calibrated  for full-scale operation in a cryogenic test facility and a water test facility.	14897

Real-Time Adaptive Algorithms for Flight Control Diagnostics and Prognostics, Phase II	2009-11-01	2018-07-19	"The overall objective of this research program is to improve the affordability, survivability, and service life of next generation aircraft through the use of ADAPT --- an integrated adaptive diagnostic and prognostic toolbox. The specific focus of the research effort is adaptive diagnostic and prognostic algorithms for systems with slowly-varying dynamics.  xxxxxx-based machinery diagnostic and prognostic techniques depend upon high-quality mathematical models of the plant.  xxxxxx uncertainties and errors decrease system sensitivity to faults and decrease the accuracy of failure prognoses.  xxxxxxver, the behavior of many physical systems changes slowly over time as the system ages.  These changes may be perfectly normal and not indicative of impending failures; however, if a static model is used, modeling errors may increase over time, which can adversely affect health monitoring system performance.  Clearly, one method to address this problem is to employ a model that adapts to system changes over time.  The risk in using data-driven models that learn online to support model-based diagnostics is that the models may \"adapt\" to a system failure, thus rendering it undetectable by the diagnostic algorithms.  An inherent trade-off exists between accurately tracking normal variations in system dynamics and potentially obscuring slow-onset failures by adapting to failure precursors that would be evident using static models.   The proposed ADAPT will feature an innovative new parameter estimation algorithm and new adaptive observer / xxxxxx filter techniques designed specifically for health monitoring.  The research team of Barron Associates, xxxxxx., the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx, and xxxxxx Aeronautics Company will demonstrate ADAPT using a high-fidelity electro-hydrostatic actuator simulation."	14899

Non Intrrusive, On-line, Simultaneous Multi-Species Impurity Monitor in Hydrogen, Phase I	2009-01-01	2018-07-19	The purity of hydrogen fuel is important in engine testing at SSC. The hydrogen may become contaminated with nitrogen, argon, or oxygen. The hydrogen from the fuel tanks or feed lines is analyzed beforehand. Therefore, there is a need for a non-intrusive, on-line, near real-time monitor for H2. The analytical technique should measure various impurities (molecular and atomic) simultaneously and be easy to implement in the field. The objective of this proposed research is to develop an analytical technique based on xxxxxx Induced Breakdown xxxxxxscopy (LIBS) to measure simultaneously the concentrations of nitrogen (N2), argon (Ar) and oxygen (O2) contaminants in hydrogen (H2) gas storage tanks and supply lines. xxxxxxanced sensors for monitoring multiple species in H2 feed-lines and storage tanks will be useful before engine testing and will increase understanding of engine performance. xxxxxx I will provide necessary information to build an improved prototype in xxxxxx, with better sensitivity and ease of implementation at xxxxxx/SSC. In xxxxxx, a prototype LIBS system will be developed to measure impurities in H2 fuel at different places in the H2 feed line. This system will be delivered to xxxxxx/SSC at the end of xxxxxx.	14902
MonitAR, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop MonitAR, an Augmented Reality (AR) system that provides procedure completion guidance to astronauts. MonitAR will replace guidance from mission control during periods of long time delay or when communication with Earth is not possible. xxxxxxs using AR glasses will receive feedback from MonitAR via visual cues as they progress through procedures on the spacecraft. The visual cues will be provided when MonitAR determines the astronaut is executing a task (a specific step in the procedure) that deviates from the current procedure. MonitAR will then guide the astronaut back to completing the task in a way that fits with the procedure. During execution, the current and upcoming tasks are proactively displayed to the astronaut in a readable form. The key innovation is to apply Case-xxxxxx Reasoning (CBR) to enable MonitAR to predict the task the astronaut is beginning to execute rather than recognize it when completed. This look-ahead capability enables guidance to be provided early enough to avoid procedure/task failure. Moreover, CBR takes advantage of the astronaut?s extensive training to capture how procedures/tasks are completed and, thereby, avoid a cumbersome and brittle modeling effort. xxxxxx procedures will be represented as tasks in a plan using Action Notation xxxxxx xxxxxxuage (xxxxxx), a planning language already being used to represent astronaut procedures. By representing the procedures as plans, the different ways a procedure can be correctly executed will be captured directly from the existing procedures.	14903
High Input Voltage Hall Thruster Discharge Converter, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	The overall scope of this xxxxxx I/II effort is the development of a high efficiency 15kW (nominal) xxxxxx thruster discharge converter.  In xxxxxx I, xxxxxx Co. xxxxxx. will design, fabricate and test a nominal 7.5kW breadboard discharge converter module.  xxxxxx proposes a converter topolgy called the xxxxxxing Edge xxxxxx (LEAPS) Bridge, which is a modification of the standard phase shifted bridge that uses an energy-recovering auxiliary circuit to force the transition from output inductor freewheel to power flowing through the main transformer.  xxxxxx on preliminary measurements with this topology the converter module demonstrated >97% efficiency at reduced power.  A 300V line input and 300-xxxxxx output range are the benchmark for the discharge converter in xxxxxx.  The most reasonable path with higher input voltage for higher power converters involves the use Wide Band Gap FETs.  MOSFETS represent the greatest payoff in terms of efficiency improvements and are a primary focus for a discharge converter to achieve an efficiency of 98% or greater.  With the design maturity gained from the xxxxxx I breadboard, the xxxxxx objective will be the production of a 15kW brassboard PPU in a flight-like form factor that incorporates conductive cooling.	14904
A New Ablative Heat Shield Sensor Suite	2013-10-01	2018-07-19	A new sensor suite is developed to measure performance of ablative thermal protection systems used in planetary entry vehicles for robotic and human exploration. The new sensor suite measures ablation of the thermal protection system under extreme heating encountered during planetary entry. The sensor technology is compatible with a variety of thermal protection materials, and is applicable over a wide range of entry conditions. The project has developed a reliable sensor that measures recession of an ablative thermal protection system used by a planetary entry vehicle. The sensor prototype has been built and tested in an arc jet facility in a flight relevant environment. The sensor suite includes optical sensors that sense existence of ultraviolet emission from high temperature gases in front of the vehicle. &nbsp;As the surface of the thermal protection system recedes, it progressively exposes each sensor and provides timed locations of the moving ablation front. The sensor data does not rely on elaborate data analysis procedure which simplifies interpretation. The sensor suite can also be integrated in a sensor plug that can be readily embedded in a variety of thermal protection materials using proven installation procedures.Using data from the sensor, it is envisioned that the design of entry systems will significantly improve by reducing mass of the thermal protection system. The thermal protection system accounts for 5-50% of the entry vehicle mass, depending on the mission, which could be traded for increased efficiency and performance.

The light source will be solar simulator with a wide spectrum of emitted light. On xxxxxx wavelengths of light down to 190 nm reach the surface (compared to Earth where only 300 nm and above reaches the surface). The soil will be the JSC.xxxxxx 1 stimulant which is known to contain 10% TiO2 (in partial reduced forms) and is supposed to be a good analog for the surface soils on xxxxxx. We will consider two possible sources of xxxxxx: first water flowing as liquid from below the surface of the soil and second water deposited as condensate on the surface of the soil. Additional two types of photocatalysts will be evaluated for methane conversion efficiencies: off shelf low cost TiO2 (P25), and doped TiO2 nanostructures (nanotubes and nanowires) for broader solar wavelength absorptions.	14906
Fiber Coupled Pulse Shaper for Sub-Nanosecond Pulse Lidar, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	This Small Business xxxxxxovation xxxxxxearch xxxxxx I effort will investigate the feasibility of using electro-optic (EO) beam scanning element to control coupling into a fiber as a fiber coupled pulse shaper.  The goal of the pulse shaper is to reduce a 4-6ns pulse to 0.4-0.6ns pulse at 1064nm and/or 532nm at input powers at the 2mJ level.   The highest utility of the proposed pulse shaper is its programability allowing it to deliver different pulse widths and different pulse shapes.  xxxxxxhough this approach to pulse shaping inherently truncates the power of the input pulse, the shaper will find its greatest value in investigating the optimal pulse shape and parameters in a given optical system.  As an added benefit, this technology can be directly morphed into a new type of Q-switch for solid state lasers requiring fewer optics, lower drive voltage and high damage threshold.  The proposed effort is broken down into 3 primary tasks: 1) fabricate EO scanning elements, 2) assemble a benchtop pulse shaper for characterization and 3) xxxxxx drive electronics with sub ns rise times and moderately high voltage.	14907

Improving Distributed Diagnosis Through Structural Model Decomposition	2013-07-29	2018-07-19	Complex engineering systems require efficient fault diagnosis methodologies, but centralized ap- proaches do not scale well, and this motivates the development of distributed solutions. This work presents an event-based approach for distributed diagnosis of abrupt parametric faults in continuous systems, by using the structural model decompo- sition capabilities provided by xxxxxx. We develop a distributed diagnosis algorithm that uses residuals, computed by extending xxxxxx, to build local event-based diagnosers based on global diagnosability analysis that gen- erate globally correct local diagnosis results. The proposed approach is applied to a multi-tank sys- tem, and results demonstrate an improvement in the design of local diagnosers. Since local diag- nosers use only a subset of the residuals, and use subsystem models to compute residuals (instead of the global system model), the local diagnosers are more efficient than previously developed dis- tributed approaches.	14910

High-performance 1024x1024 MWIR/LWIR Dual-band InAs/GaSb Type-II Superlattice-based Camera System, Phase II	2017-06-01	2018-07-19	High performance xxxxxx detectors are highly needed. In order to image from long distance, it is important that imagers have high sensitivity, high resolution, and very low dark currents. This leads to technical goals of having low noise, low dark current in small size pixels in large arrays. While saturated performance levels of traditional systems based on bulk semiconductors have not quite met the requirement of applications, it is expected that novel quantum systems will bring new development stage for infrared imagers. In recent years, xxxxxx-II InAs/xxxxxx superlattice (T2SL) has experienced significant development, from theoretical modeling, material growth to device processing and packaging. Performance of xxxxxx detector based on T2SL has become comparable, even better than that of xxxxxx. xxxxxxver, xxxxxx T2SL devices have been shown to be limited by surface leakage, especially at lower operating temperature. This proposed effort will investigate gating of xxxxxx-II photodiodes as a means to suppress this bottle neck of T2SL technology. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an effective method to completely suppress the surface leakage current in xxxxxx type-II superlattice photodiodes that is compatible with the development of high performance gated FPAs in xxxxxx.	14912

These particulates would be delivered to instruments on a spacecraft or lander for continual analysis. Therefore, instead of recording data from one pass of an orbiter or being at the mercy of a solid sample inlet, scientists could choose their targets over a wider range, bringing significantly more value to planetary missions.	14914

Woven TPS – A Revolutionary Approach to Tailorable TPS Design & Manufacturing for Thermal Management Systems & Entry, Descent & Landing Systems	2013-01-01	2018-07-19	The thermal protection material system (TPS) is the barrier that protects the space vehicle from atmospheric entry heating. Woven TPS is a concept that leverages the mature weaving technology that has evolved from the textile industry to design TPS with tailorable performance by varying a material's composition and properties by the controlled placement of fibers within a woven structure.    The woven TPS approach that is being proposed has the capability to address two of the major challenges faced by xxxxxx TPS community: 1. The inability to optimize a TPS material for a given mission due to the high costs and long schedules associated with material development and certification. This drives xxxxxx to utilize unoptimized TPS materials for a given mission which can result in significant weight penalties; 2. The typical scenario wherein xxxxxx TPS materials have no other government or commercial applications and do not utilize manufacturing processes leveraging common commercial processes. Given that there are few xxxxxx missions, and that these missions are years apart, this results in xxxxxx incurring high costs to maintain manufacturing infrastructure or incurring the cost and risk of restarting manufacturing. The woven TPS approach has the potential to tailor a material's properties by the accurate placement of fibers of different composition with different spacings utilizing commercially available weaving technology, including equipment, modeling and design tools to optimize the weave. This allows for the control of material composition and density in three dimensions, resulting in tailored material performance. Given that the constituent properties of the fibers are known, in the future with modified tools it should be possible to predict the material's performance. This should result in a material that can be optimized for a given mission, and although some testing will still be required to certify the final product for the mission, it should substantially reduce the overall testing requirements and hence reduce the cost and schedule.	14920
A Bayesian Framework for Remaining Useful Life Estimation	2013-05-13	2018-07-19	The estimation of remaining useful life (RUL) of a faulty component is at the center of system prognostics and health management. It gives operators a potent tool in decision making by quantifying how much time is left until functionality is lost. This is especially true for aerospace systems, where unanticipated subsystem downtime may lead to catastrophic failures. RUL prediction needs to contend with multiple sources of error like modeling inconsistencies, system noise and degraded sensor fidelity. xxxxxxian theory of uncertainty management provides a way to contain these problems by integrating out the nuisance variables. We use the xxxxxx (RVM), for model development. RVM is a xxxxxxian treatment of the well known xxxxxx (SVM), a kernel-based regression/classification technique. This model is next used in a xxxxxx Filter (PF) framework. Statistical estimates of the noise in the system and anticipated operational conditions are processed to provide estimates of RUL in the form of a probability density function (PDF). xxxxxx of this approach on experimental data collected from xxxxxx batteries is presented.	14921
Automated Robust Maneuver Design and Optimization	2019-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx is seeking improvements to the current technologies related to Position, Navigation and xxxxxx. In particular, it is desired to automate precise maneuver planning and optimization and gradually implement the technologies with increasing levels of autonomy. Typically, maneuvers are designed on the ground and uploaded to operating spacecraft (SC) when a communication channel is open. This works well with avoidance maneuvers regarding SC in Earth orbit or trajectory correction maneuvers in deep space with a generous link budget. In justification for automation, quick decisions may need to be made when a communication channel is not available or precious time in a link budget will be used for maneuver planning instead of scientific pursuit. To compound issues, the optimality of a non-robust maneuver for a particular scenario may break down in the presence of uncertainty, which possibly reduces SC lifetime or increases risk. For these reasons, it is important to achieve automated, robust maneuver design with optimization.Design optimizations that do not include stochastic processes are not desensitized to random perturbations in the state or other parameters and therefore are not suitable for robust autonomous applications. On the other hand, comprehensive processes such as MC are computationally intractable for on-board use. Without information such as mean values, standard deviations or probability of failure, the reliability of an optimization may not be known. Because astrodynamic systems and flight hardware contain many uncertainties, any autonomous optimization must take uncertainty into account.It is proposed that, by building on the work of Polynomial Chaos (PC), utilizing separated representations (SR) to estimate the state and maneuver of a SC will allow autonomous planning and optimization. Similar to PC, SR uses a polynomial surrogate model to produce an accurate PDF of a state without xxxxxx assumptions and with a fast convergence time. The difference is that the theoretical computation costs of SR are lower than that of PC. Whereas PC computation costs increase exponentially with respect to stochastic dimension, SR costs increase only quadratically. It has been shown that polynomial surrogates are computationally efficient for optimization when compared to traditional techniques and it has also been shown that polynomial surrogates benefit greatly from multi-core processing. These increases in efficiency, along with decreasing costs relative to PC, are hypothesized to enable autonomous, on-board optimization and planning, which is a current target in xxxxxx technology road-map.A systematic analysis of increasing dimensions for varying ODEs will be enforced in order to determine the computation times of SR. Afterward, the goal is to estimate a maneuver PDF with SR. The approach will involve adding three more stochastic dimensions of delta velocity to the input dimensions in order to replicate a maneuver. Instantaneous or continuous burns will be investigated using this method.The second phase of research will involve implementing an optimization routine within the developed SR framework. Robust optimization has also been accomplished with other polynomial surrogates such as PC, as well as traditional methods such as MC. Therefore, there are baselines of performance to compare to. It is a high priority to compare the performance of SR with these other methods. The last significant portion of research will deal with implementation. Specifically, the performance of SR on relevant multi-core processors will be compared to that of existing benchmarks. After initial multi-core implementation, work at xxxxxx centers will help narrow the field of possibilities and allow for the programming of SR with available flight hardware in mind. The performance of maneuver planning and optimization for these systems will be studied and maximized for potential future use in xxxxxx missions.	14922

This novel instrument will record concentration measurements of multiple gases including CO and xxxxxx with ultrahigh sensitivity, stability, and accuracy in real time with low power consumption and without external calibration.  By increasing the measurement sensitivity of CO and xxxxxx, the proposed device will allow reliable, gravity-independent monitoring of ecological stability in environments at arbitrary gravity range.

Dust Mitigation Strategies for High Pressure Oxygen QDs, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	As human spaceflight once again moves toward planetary exploration, space suit hardware must be ready to face the harsh environmental conditions of these surfaces. This is especially true for High Pressure xxxxxx Quick Disconnects. These systems are critical life support items that enable the flow of breathing gas, water, and electrical & communication signals from the suit to the vehicle or habitat. xxxxxx and xxxxxx dust and regolith can have a detrimental effect ranging from an annoyance during mate & demate, to a severe hazard through contamination of the breathing gas lines.The work proposed in this effort will focus on dust mitigation strategies that can be used in a variety of High Pressure xxxxxx Quick Disconnects.

After a variety of dust mitigation options are developed, the third step in this process will be implementation of the strategies into the connector designs. The final step in this process will be testing of the strategies through samples and mock-ups in a simulated dirty environment.	14932
Unstructured Mesh Movement and Viscous Mesh Generation for CFD-Based Design Optimization, Phase II	2007-12-01	2018-07-19	The innovations proposed are twofold: 1) a robust unstructured mesh movement method able to handle isotropic (xxxxxx), anisotropic (viscous), mixed element (hybrid) and generalized polyhedral unstructured grids for CFD applications, particularly, CFD-based design optimization, and 2) a robust method to automatically insert high quality anisotropic prismatic (viscous boundary layer) cells into any existing CFD mesh. All objectives in xxxxxx I were met and all tasks were completed as proposed. The methods worked very well for both 2D and 3D geometries, for tetrahedral, hexahedral, and general polyhedral element types, and for the simple viscous meshes. In xxxxxx, we will extend the software into a general purpose package for use by xxxxxx, other Government agencies, and commercial customers.  We will implement our 3D viscous mesh generation method including a general solution-adaptive meshing capability. We will develop the software necessary to compute sensitivity derivatives of the mesh operations. Two important software design goals for our final xxxxxx software are ease-of-use and convenient access to its functionality. We will develop two types of user interfaces: graphical access (for the end-user) and programming access (for integration with flow solvers). We will assemble all of the methods developed in xxxxxx into a single, coherent, design-oriented, product-version code with extensive focus on incorporating a parallel processing capability into the software.  The verification & validation plan will follow the industry-standard approach now used by commercial software houses and will include an extensive set of xxxxxx-relevant test cases.  The software will be documented and delivered to xxxxxx. xxxxxx software has significant potential for commercialization and sales in the non-Government sector.	14933
Miniature Optical Isolator, Phase II	2018-04-01	2018-07-19	To address xxxxxx need for compact optical isolators, xxxxxxical xxxxxxics Corporation (POC) proposes to continue the development of a new Miniature xxxxxxical Isolator (MOI). The novel optical isolator design is based on enhanced magneto-optical (MO) effects in magnetic photonic crystals. The innovation in the technology is its capacity to engineer MO effects not only by choosing the right material but also by adjusting the lattice parameters of 1 dimensional photonic crystals. While occupying a very small volume (~0.1 cm^3), a MOI device will achieve high optical transmission (2 dB or less forward loss) and excellent optical isolation (40 dB) at target wavelengths at a low cost. Therefore, the MOI technology directly addresses xxxxxx requirements for a compact, robust optical isolator for applications in cold atom systems. In xxxxxx I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of the MOI technology through modeling and analysis, as well as fabrication of a proof-of-concept prototype with basic performance parameters characterized. In xxxxxx, POC will further optimize the device and fabricate prototypes for validation of key performance metrics, as well as evaluate life cycle and environmental performance.	14934

Large-Scale Molded Silicon Oxycarbide Composite Components for Ultra-Low-Cost Lightweight Mirrors, Phase II	2018-04-01	2018-07-19	Next-generation telescopes need mirrors that are extremely stable, lightweight, and affordable. Semplastics has developed a novel, innovative ceramic material which is lightweight, low-cost, and ideal for application as a mirror substrate. High-thickness, high-stiffness objects with excellent dimensional stability, low density, and low coefficient of thermal expansion can be manufactured in one piece through our energy-efficient process. Semplastics is proposing to extend prior research and manufacturing process development to produce larger-scale circular mirrors. This innovation will reduce mirror costs per square meter by an order of magnitude over current approaches based on glass or glass-ceramic solutions. As a part of the xxxxxx effort, Semplastics will deliver to xxxxxx four large mirrors (up to 0.6m in diameter), sealed to address the residual surface porosity using one of two different coating systems, with ground and polished surfaces. At the end of xxxxxx, we will have matured and developed our production processes such that we are ready to establish the capability to produce mirrors of one meter diameter or larger.	14937
Self-Powered Magnetothermal Fluid Pump, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	The ability to successfully manage thermal loads is increasingly a primary design constraint for many emerging engineered systems.  xxxxxxs ranging from military aircraft to computational platforms to photovoltaic (PV) power generation all generate unwanted heat and traditional methods for transporting and removing this heat are often heavy, cumbersome, power hungry, or lack adequate heat removal capacity.  Excess heat can result in reduced efficiency in PV systems, limit duty cycles for pulsed power applications, and ultimately cause failure of critical components if not managed properly.  Similar problematic scenarios exist for many power generation systems, high power radio frequency (RF) devices, portable electronics, and lasers, to name a few.A host of thermal management techniques are currently available including heat pipes, liquid immersion, jet impingement and sprays, thermoelectric coolers, and refrigeration.  While these techniques are adequate in some cases, none of these methods alone can meet the needs of future high power thermal management without incurring large penalties of weight, power, or volume.  The technology proposed here overcomes these limitations through autonomic, self-powered, and self-cooling functionality by directly converting the unwanted thermal energy into useable mechanical energy for use in coolant pumps or refrigeration compressors.	14938
Experimental Evaluation of Geopolymer and ‘Lunamer’ Binders as Radioactive Shielding Materials for Space Applications	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxs are inorganic cementitious binders produced by polymeric reaction between an aluminosilica rich material and an alkali metal hydroxide/silicate liquid, forming a binding gel, which can be used to encapsulate fine and coarse aggregates to produce concrete. While earth-based applications utilize commonly available materials, such as metakaolin, fly ash, or even rice husk, researchers have reproduced lunar regolith to make geopolymer concrete specimens ('xxxxxx') by activating the regolith with alkali liquid. xxxxxx binder technology presents superior mechanical and thermal performance, and has been shown to be compatible with an abundantly available lunar resource (lunar regolith).  The highly conductive geopolymer has been enhanced further for use  in electromagnetic (EMI) shielding and electrostatic discharge (ESD) applications. Conductive filler materials (carbon fibers and/or carbon black) were added to the geopolymer matrix. xxxxxx measurements were performed to determine the conductivity value of different conductive composite formulations. xxxxxxults indicated that conductive geopolymer matrices are very effective in blocking electromagnetic waves of frequencies greater than 1 GHz. Therefore, to understand space-based applications, next steps should include characterizing radiation shielding effectiveness of geopolymer and 'xxxxxx' concrete.The purpose of this project is to develop lunar regolith based geopolymer concrete and perform differential shielding studies on various geopolymer formulations to determine if sufficient protection from radiation in space environments can be enabled. For the initial testing of these concrete matrices, a variety of locally-available radiation sources will be used. As part of the proposed work, geopolymer and 'xxxxxx' concrete matrices will be constructed and their ability to shield radiation will be evaluated. The geopolymer matrices will be prepared using fly ash as the pre-curser, barite (BaSO4) and hematite (xxxxxx) as the aggregate and metallic chips, representing the state-of-the-art in xxxxxxbased construction practices. The 'xxxxxx' concrete matrices will be made using geopolymerized lunar regolith with entrained carbon fibers and carbon black for EMI shielding and metallic chips. These will include radiation energies within this range of biological interest, but will also include those of lower energies. While such low energy sources cannot be used to correlate the biological impact of high energy radiation, they do provide a useful tool to quantify the relative shielding behavior of different materials.                   	14939

Novel Ultralow-Weight Metal Rubber Sensor System for Ultra Long-Duration Scientific Balloons, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxSonic proposes to develop an innovative, ultralow mass density, and non-intrusive sensor system for ultra long duration balloons that will operate in the most extreme environmental conditions.  Specifically, the sensors would be integrated onto the load bearing seams and/or outer balloon mesh surface of the pressurized balloon system to accurately and continually measure axial loads.  Large axial load forces and wide/extreme temperature ranges (-90oC to >450oC) are typical for planetary balloon missions, therefore a durable, flexible, and thermally stable sensor material.  xxxxxxSonic would use its highly flexible, low-modulus Metal RubberTM (MRTM) materials as strain/pressure sensors that are capable of large cyclic deformation without failure.  MRTM is a free-standing nanocomposite material produced by the layer-by-layer combination of high performance polymers and electrically-conducting metal nanoparticles that provide durability and recoverability for sensor transduction, and a wide thermal operation range.  Importantly, MRTM can behave like a rubber band in that it can be folded and compressed for stowage and then can be deployed and continually pressurized and stretched without failure during operation.  Also, because of the very low amount of metallic nanoclusters in the system (<0.02 volume %), the sensor system is extremely low-weight and would not alter the performance of the balloon.	14947
Earth/Mars Landing Impact Attenuation Using Foam	2013-06-01	2018-07-19	Used results from extensive foam testing performed on a previous JSC xxxxxxovation Charge Account (ICA) project to develop material models in MSC/xxxxxx commercial finite element analysis code. This will enable accurate landing impact load attenuation modeling of foam sandwiches, foam cut to match irregular shaped hardware, and foam cut in specialized shapes to customize attenuation performance.  xxxxxxs & xxxxxx:  * A correlated MSC/MARC material database for four popular flight / shipping foams: Polyfoam , xxxxxx, xxxxxx and xxxxxx.  A condensed list of modeling best practices.  * xxxxxxology to convert test data to MSC/MARC materials database for any foam.  Infusion Potential  * The database and modeling techniques may be utilized to design landing load attenuation for crew seats and other hardware in xxxxxxn;  for better designed foam packaging to ship critical flight hardware to launch facilities throughout the world.  On a previous ICA, a test correlated excel based software tool was developed using the innovative Stress‑Energy method to better model impact attenuation using foam. This pioneering tool was used to design packaging foam for impact attenuation of xxxxxx flight hardware during ground shipment and of sensitive avionics in xxxxxxn parachute landing tests.  The xxxxxxn project has reported no avionic damage during drop tests since the implementation of foam attenuation. This tool was limited to modeling flat foam pieces of uniform section with hardware center of gravity (CG) centered over the foam. xxxxxxver, the hardware being protected were not necessarily flat and many assumptions need to be made that affect accuracy of the 'G' load and foam compression estimations. xxxxxx may be modeled using a commercial nonlinear finite element codes available at JSC such as MSC/xxxxxx. It is proposed that results from the extensive testing done to develop the aforementioned ICA funded excel tool, now be used to develop accurate MSC/xxxxxx material models and establish a methodology to convert test results into material models. This will enable the rapid design of foam configurations cut to match the irregular shaped hardware to be protected. xxxxxx may be cut in pyramidical shapes to provide flexibility in designing load reduction curves to match hardware attenuation needs. xxxxxx sandwiches may also be designed containing layers of different foam types. Attenuating xxxxxx/Earth landing impact loads are considered critical for mission success and this technology will considerably reduce risk.	14948
Development of Strained-Layer Superlattice (SLS) IR Detector Camera	2013-10-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx (SLS) detectors are a new class of detectors which may be the next generation of band-gap engineered, large format infrared detector arrays with substantially higher quantum efficiencies than existing quantum well infrared photodetectors (xxxxxxs) and provide a competitive alternative to the current state-of-the-art mercury cadmium telluride and xxxxxx detector arrays. The anticipated advantages of SLS detector technology over existing IR detectors are: high sensitivity, band-gap tunable wavelength response (similar to xxxxxxs), warmer operating temperatures, array spectral uniformity (yet to be realized), high temporal stability, relatively low cost of manufacturing, scalability (to very large format arrays) and multiple vendor sources all contributing to higher performing scientific instruments. Previously, (in our FY12 IRAD \"xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxor Array Characterization\") we verified that these devices exhibit a dramatic increase in quantum efficiency (QE) over quantum well infrared photodetectors (xxxxxxs) and are approaching QE values comparable with mercury cadmium telluride and indium antimonide detectors.   This a major technological breakthrough, yet before we embark on an expensive in-house program to design and fabricate SLS detectors it would be very valuable to build an IR camera system using the existing SLS array we currently have and perform experimental field tests.xxxxxx (SLS) detectors are a new class of detectors.   In our FY12 IRAD \"xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxor Array Characterization\" we verified that these devices exhibit a dramatic increase in quantum efficiency (QE) over quantum well infrared photodetectors (xxxxxxs) and are approaching QE values comparable with mercury cadmium telluride and indium antimonide detectors.   The anticipated advantages of SLS detector technology over existing IR detectors are: high sensitivity, band-gap tunable wavelength response (similar to xxxxxxs), warmer operating temperatures, array spectral uniformity (yet to be realized), high temporal stability, relatively low cost of manufacturing, scalability (to very large format arrays) and multiple vendor sources all contributing to higher performing scientific instruments.  Warmer and more stable focal planes lead to simpler instrument designs which result in higher reliability, longer mission lifetimes and reduced costs.   In our FY12 IRAD we obtained a test SLS array and performed extensive tests to ascertain the veracity of researcher claims, as well as to assess the potential applications to xxxxxx missions from a practical infusion standpoint.   The most important result of that investigation was the verification of the (unexpected) very high QE.  xxxxxxver, along with the dramatic improvement in QE we measured much higher dark current and the array was quite non-uniform.

Phobos L1 Operational Tether Experiment (PHLOTE)	2018-01-01	2018-07-19	A sensor package that “floats” just above the surface of xxxxxx, suspended by a tether from a small spacecraft operating at xxxxxx 1 (L1) Point would offer exciting opportunities for science (SMD), for human exploration (HEOMD) and for advancements in space technology (STMD). xxxxxx information on the xxxxxx moon xxxxxx is limited even though it is considered an important destination for near term human exploration. A PHLOTE spacecraft would perform fixed point station keeping at the xxxxxx/xxxxxx L1 point to allow a tethered sensor package to “float” just above the moon’s surface and also park instruments on the surface for in situ science measurements. This can include ground penetrating radar for subsurface composition measurements to determine how thick the layer of fine grained regolith is for future landings. Other key instruments would be dosimeters for understanding the radiation environments for future human missions, cameras, and a spectrometer for surface mineral analysis. If deployed after a human landing, a PHLOTE spacecraft could provide a constant “eye in the sky” for ground controllers to monitor mission deployments and operational activities. The PHLOTE mission concept has only now become feasible due to recent technology advances, many of which have been supported by xxxxxx STMD. xxxxxx technologies that make this mission concept feasible include: The Navigation xxxxxx (NDL) xxxxxx for the providing precise spacecraft position and rate knowledge relative to xxxxxx. This high precision is needed to maintain position at the L1 point; xxxxxx (CNT) braided yarns for a structurally strong tether that doubles as a power and data conduit, xxxxxxlightweight solar arrays, and highly efficient electrospray micro-propulsion thrusters for long term “hover mode” station keeping.xxxxxx offers a key waypoint toward enabling human surface landings on xxxxxx. In particular xxxxxx, which always faces xxxxxx due to xxxxxx’ synchronous rotation, provides an excellent stepping stone destination as a precursor to a human xxxxxx landing. There is very limited information on the composition and the environments at xxxxxx on xxxxxx. Since xxxxxx has a composition similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, it is believed that it could provide minerals that can be used for xxxxxx xxxxxxource Utilization (ISRU) to recover key elements such as xxxxxx for use as return trip propellant. The mission concept below would answer many of these questions as well as provide xxxxxx advancement in key technology areas for human exploration.This mission concept is a synthesis of new technologies that would provide a unique platform for multiple sensors directed at xxxxxx as well as xxxxxx. Since the xxxxxx/xxxxxx L1 point is only ~3.1 km from the surface of xxxxxx, the PHLOTE tether length only needs to be a few kilometers long. A tether configuration with its Center of Gravity at the xxxxxx/xxxxxx L1 point can place a sensor package on the moon’s surface or float it just above. Due to xxxxxx’ very low gravity, the tether will be under very low tensile loads.Using a longer tether, this concept can be similarly used for other missions such as xxxxxx/xxxxxx or at xxxxxx L1 point where both bodies are tidally locked which means a PHLOTE spacecraft with a much longer tether could descend into xxxxxx tenuous atmosphere and sample its chemistry at all elevations unlike a traditional probe.If selected, a feasibility study for the xxxxxx L1 Operational xxxxxx Experiment (PHLOTE) mission would be performed that will define the PHLOTE mission, determine the technology needs and assess the technology readiness. The study would also model the system, identify risks, as well as explore new science opportunities that could be done with this unique sensor platform.	14960
Roving in the Permanently Shadowed Regions of Planetary Bodies	2018-08-01	2018-07-19	The existence of volatiles in the polar regions of airless planets has recently been verified by the LCROSS and Messenger missions. These polar volatiles are dry ices of water, methane, and ammonia. After processing, it is possible to breathe, drink, burn, fuel, and create with these volatiles. The production of resources external to Earth will allow for space vehicles and outposts to utilize the local resources of a planet to supply space exploration missions, rather than being dependent on resources launched from Earth. The majority of the volatiles on the xxxxxx and Mercury exist in or near the permanently shaded craters at the polar regions. Existing rover technologies are incapable of the types of perception, navigation, and planning required by the challenges of a dark environment that restrict the rover's ability to perceive its surroundings, tread upon cryogenic regolith, tolerate communication interruptions, and overcome inherent uncertainty. Due to these technical challenges, rover missions have not yet operated at polar latitudes. xxxxxxovative technologies to address these challenges are essential for exploring for volatiles and operating in these polar regions. The proposed technology, for instance, could enable xxxxxx 2018 RESOLVE mission to explore polar volatiles. Operations in illuminated and benign climates are well understood. This research proposes to examine and produce novel methods for sensing, mapping, and localization in and around the permanently dark regions of planetary bodies. The research will enable the exploration of previously inaccessible dark environments including pits, cold traps, and subterranean voids such as lava tubes and caves on the xxxxxx and xxxxxx. This research will additionally have impacts on the operation of robots at night, in subterranean cavities, and other dark environments.The proposed research will allow robots to perceive their surroundings in the absence of sunlight by developing innovative methods in passive sensing, computational imaging, and active lighting. The approach is to build a better representation of the scene by capturing and combining multiple images of the same scene while modulating the imaging parameters (e.g. lighting, focus, exposure, etc.). The produced images can then be transformed and used with digital elevation maps, pre-existing multi-spectral orbital imagery, and simultaneous localization and mapping methods to map the robot's terrain and iteratively estimate its position in the dark. The research will develop methods of sensor fusion and domain considerations to enhance the rover's perception abilities and build high-resolution 3D models of the rover's environment with graphical models like xxxxxx and Belief Propagation.Sensing methods will be characterized and evaluated on artificial and analog terrains under planetary lighting conditions. Comparative studies will be performed to determine the optimal sensors and possible areas of novel development. Localization and mapping algorithms will then be developed and tested with simulated data on pre-existing data derived from the xxxxxx and xxxxxxs. Small scale testing will then be conducted in analog terrain under relevant lighting conditions and by collecting overhead imagery. Once the methods have been validated in simulation and small scale testing they will be field-tested in several relevant environments including subterranean mines and outdoor sites during darkness.	14961

High Fidelity Multi-Scale Regolith Simulation Tool for ISRU, Phase II	2011-02-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx has serious unmet needs for simulation tools capable of predicting the behavior of lunar regolith in proposed excavation, transport and handling systems.  Existing discrete element method (DEM) or finite element (FE) models lack adequate fidelity for fine cohesive powders comprised of friable particles with irregular shapes and exhibiting substantial bulk dilation upon initial excavation.  As such, they are inadequate for assessing the reliability of regolith excavation and handling systems, and even less so for evaluation of engineering trade-offs between total system mass, power and energy consumption.  Also, current simulation tools do not include the effects of triboelectric and photo-ionization-induced charges on regolith particles.xxxxxxing on the successful xxxxxx-1development of a new charge-patch electrostatic model and a comprehensive cohesive particle interaction model for DEM, Grainflow Dynamics proposes to develop a high-fidelity predictive calculational tool, in the form of a DEM module with calibrated interparticle-interaction relationships, coupled with a FE module utilizing enhanced, calibrated, constitutive models which, together, are capable of mimicking both large deformations and the flow behavior of regolith simulants and lunar regolith under conditions anticipated in ISRU operations. This will not only provide unparalleled fidelity but also will leverage the computational efficiency of the continuum FE codes to drastically reduce the simulation time and resources necessary to perform engineering analyses on regolith systems. In addition, the modules will be parallelized to maximize their usefulness in multi-core and cluster computing environments. This work will lead to an improved engineering design tool that can be used by xxxxxx engineers and contractors developing designs for ISRU equipment to evaluate both the reliability of various configurations as well as the trade-offs of system designs.	14964

Surround Visual & Sensory Feedback for Robotic Arm Pilots, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	Robotic systems in space carry a lower risk tolerance than robotic systems on earth. Humans require faster learning curves for introduction of more complex robotics in space, but the only way to accomplish this is to acquire open source software on easily adaptable hardware. This will enable astronauts to perform multiple design cycles while they are in space, such as on the xxxxxx.

Using 360 degree cameras, LIDAR, and a xxxxxx armband, the robotic pilot will be able to quickly adapt to any environment from anywhere, including mission control. The key is that all of this work is being built from open source platforms so that nothing becomes overly proprietary, and astronauts can perform design cycles in space quickly and efficiently.	14967

Interfacing the Paramesh Computational Libraries to the Cactus Computational Framework, Phase II	2010-01-01	2018-07-19	"Our proposal and the xxxxxx I work completed under it addressed these xxxxxx-identified needs by providing software infrastructure that provides physical scientists a \"plug-and-play\" architecture in which they can insert their \"physics kernels\" and exploit very large existing code bases for the computer science aspects of the problem.  In particular, our STTR product provides cutting-edge adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) capabilities, and our xxxxxx I results demonstrate the ability of our software architecture to run existing physics code with the newly incorporated AMR driver.

Both of these software packages have large user bases in the areas of computational fluid dynamics and numerical general relativity, and both had existing users at xxxxxx GSFC.  Prior to our xxxxxx I work, there was no way these user communities to collaborate directly, leading each user group to redevelop software already available in the other user community."	14969

An Airborne Particulate Monitor for Spacecraft, Phase II	2018-04-01	2018-07-19	A compact instrument will be develop to provide long-term monitoring of the number concentration and approximate size of airborne particles in microgravity environments such as found aboard spacecraft cabins. xxxxxx as small as 10 nm will be detected by a self-sustaining, tippable, water-based condensation particle counter. This will be coupled to an optical sizing instrument to provide particle concentration and approximate sizing from 10 nm to >20 micrometers.xxxxxx of the concentration and size of airborne particles on manned spacecraft is needed to assess environment to which astronauts are exposed, and to provide early warning of on-board fire.  Especially important are those in the submicrometer size range.  Yet to date there is no zero-gravity technique for long-term monitoring these fine particles at the low concentrations generally present.    Our innovation, a tippable, self-sustaining, water-based condensation particle counter, will provide this measurement.  Individual particles as small as 10nm are detected through condensational enlargement to form optically detectable droplets. Unlike other condensational methods all liquid water required for measurement is contained within, and recpatured by, the wick of the instrument. All water transport is by capillary action, and thus enabling operation at zero gravity. xxxxxxd with ultrafine particle precut, and standard optical particle counting and sizing for larger particles, this instrument system will provide particle number concentration and approximate sizing from 10 nm to above 20 micrometers.	14973
Explainable and Scalable Planning with Probabilistic Temporal Logic Specifications	2020-01-01	2018-07-19	Human spaceflight operations challenge currently available planning technology. They typically rely on a large number of integrated functions including mission planning, crew planning, solar array management, power and thermal management and system health monitoring. These functions serve under heterogenous uncertainties (stemming from anomalies and faults in equipment and intrinsic unknowns about the environment), time-varying requirements and multiple, possibly competing objectives. Co-work with the crew introduces unique difficulties as well. Humans’ capabilities and limitations in these capabilities add to the uncertainties. Humans’ preferences and need for compatibility between the humans and autonomous control protocols introduce unconventional constraints. The proposed effort introduces a paradigm shift in the planning-execution loop by addressing a number of these challenges. Our emphasis particularly on unambiguous, formal specifications and compilation of executable control software with provable guarantees and systematic sensitivity analysis diffuses the critical concern of reliability throughout the planning execution loop. The proposed algorithms will incorporate models with stochastic as well as nondeterministic uncertainties and rich specifications with temporal and logical relations as well as probabilistic and real-time modalities as needed. xxxxxxted planning for the coupled functions introduces possibilities for system-level optimization, e.g., in performance, weights and overall cost. Finally, the proposed algorithmic and architectural advances will improve not  only the scalability of the resulting synthesis algorithms but also their interpretability by and explainability to the crew and designers.	14974
A Novel Approach of Sensitive Infrared Signal Detection for Space Applications	2014-10-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx an innovative frequency up-conversion device that will efficiently convert the infrared signals into visible/near-infrared signals to enable detection of infrared signals with high sensitivity, high dynamic range, fast response, and low noise background. We propose an innovative approach to overcome the infrared signal detection difficulties.&nbsp; In this investigation, a Periodical Poled xxxxxx Lithium Niobate (PPxxxxxxLN) based frequency up-conversion devices will be developed to efficiently convert the infrared signals into visible/near-infrared signals which can be sensitively detected by well-developed superior silicon avalanche photodiodes (Si-APD). This innovative device will allow detect infrared signals with high sensitivity, high dynamic range, fast response, and low noise background.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principle of up-conversion device is based on non-linear interaction btween two optical beams.&nbsp; When a strong pump beam&nbsp; and a weak probe beam interact in a suitable nonlinear crystal, a signal at third frequency is generated under the condition of energy and momentum conservation. For example, interaction between a pump beam at 1.06&micro;m and weak infrared 2.05&micro;m beam in the PPxxxxxxLN crystal can generate photons at 0.7&micro;m wavelength. The number of probe photons is much smaller than that pump photons because the probe beam is usually very weak. Only a small portion of pump photons have the chance to mix with probe photons to generate photons at sum frequency of the pump and probe beam. Therefore, the circulating power in the crystal is constant because of the negligible pump depletion. In theory, every infrared probe photons can be converted into visible/near infrared photons&nbsp;&nbsp; An intra-cavity pumped up-conversion device is designed to demonstrate the frequency up conversion capbility. One periodically poled PPxxxxxxLN is used in this study.&nbsp; A CW 808 nm diode laser is used to pump a xxxxxxYAG rod inside the cavity to generate the 1064 nm pump beam. The leakage of 1064 nm light is used to monitor the circulating intra-cavity pump power. A two-micron DFB laser was also aligned through the PPxxxxxxLN to simulate the weak probe beam.&nbsp; CaF2 dispersion prisms and laser line filters were used to separate the generated 700 nm photons from the photons at other wavelengths for accurate visible signal measurement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The up-converted photons can be measured with xxxxxx Single Photon xxxxxx detector to take advantages of its high quantum efficiency and low dark current. Thus, extremely weak infrared signal can be measured with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy.&nbsp;	14975
High Performance Nanolauncher, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The proposed Low Cost xxxxxxlauncher (LCN) is an upper stage using a new, inexpensive propulsion system.  The xxxxxx I program will combine several technologies with a simple design strategy to produce a flight-weight propulsion system that is easy to fabricate and operate.  Self pressurizing propellants will minimize complexity of the propulsion system and vortex cold-wall technology will be used to simplify the combustion chamber.  An inexpensive, light weight nozzle is being developed by xxxxxx State xxxxxxersity using carbon phenolics.  Commercially available components will be use where possible to further minimize costs.The xxxxxx I LNC will demonstrate these technologies through ground testing of a flight-like propulsion system.  A small launch vehicle second stage will be designed based on the experimental performance characteristics.  This work will form the basis for a family of vehicle stages from smaller upper stages to a main booster stage.  The low cost technologies and design methods employed in the LNC will reduce the cost of launching nanosatellites into orbit.	14976
The Stinger: A Geotechnical Sensing Package for Robotic Scouting on a Small Planetary Rover, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	Flawless operation of planetary mobility systems, excavation, mining and ISRU operations, regolith transport and many others depend on knowledge of geotechnical properties of the soil. xxxxxx, for example, the soil strength and its density and in turn fundamental soil parameters such as friction angle and apparent or true cohesion, will guide the design of the wheels and excavation systems and help to determine anticipated excavation energies, time, and forces.Nearly all planetary rovers to-date have experienced some type of problem due to the unknown nature of planetary regolith.  The MER xxxxxx mission ended when the rover bogged down.  The MER Opportunity rover barely recovered from a sand trap. MSL Curiosity spent over a month trying to find a safer route around a sand dune.  xxxxxx xxxxxx Roving Vehicle got stuck and had to be lifted and placed on firmer ground while xxxxxx managed to recover from a 'near' stuck position.xxxxxx, therefore, proposes to design and test a prototype geotechnical tool called the xxxxxx, that combines soil bearing strength measurements with shear test measurements.  The xxxxxx instrument consists of a percussive cone shear-vane penetrometer capable of measuring near-surface and subsurface soil properties to a depth of 50 cm or greater. The cone deployment is percussive, because this approach reduces penetration forces, an important consideration when a tool is deployed in a low gravity environment from a small vehicle. During percussive cone deployment, the soil bearing strength is measured. The shear vane is initially housed inside a cone and it is pushed out whenever shear tests are required. When the shear vane is out, the cone-vane is rotated to measure shear strength of the soil. This measurement can be performed at any depth.xxxxxx on results of the breadboard testing, a preliminary design for a xxxxxx xxxxxx GeoTool will also be realized.	14977

Development of a Wide-Spectrum Organic Analysis Instrument	2013-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxing a two-step laser mass spectrometer (ultra-L2MS) to enable in situ micrometer-scale analysis of diverse organic molecules with sub-femtomole sensitivity. With previous IRD support we designed and constructed a vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser source, which enables efficient, soft, single-photon ionization of organic molecules. We incorporated this VUV ion source with our instrument and have successfully measured hundreds of organic molecules on test samples. The modified instrument is unique and enables the measurement of organic molecules with an unprecedented combination of sensitivity and spatial resolution.In FY'13 we expanded our analysis of samples to include astromaterials and biological materials relevant to international space station (xxxxxx) and human space flight (HSF). We are also in the process of integrating our existing UV laser photoionization source with the new VUV source to enable both to be operated simultaneously. By combining VUV photons with UV/xxxxxx photons we can explore the use of novel two-photon (118.2 nm + 1064/532/355/266 nm) resonant and non-resonant ionization schemes. By timing the photons from both sources to arrive simultaneously in the ionization region of the ultra-L2MS instrument we can further the expanding of the range of detectable molecular species. Additionally by allowing a controlled delay between the arrival of photons from the two sources (time-delayed two-photon ionization) it may also be possible to provide structural information for certain molecular species that could not be provided by conventional mass spectrometry techniques. 	14981
SpaceDoc-Intelligent Health Management System for Astronauts, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx health and performance are critical to successful space explorations. xxxxxxver, long duration missions present numerous risks to crew health and performance. Human exploration missions beyond low earth orbit (LEO) will present additional challenges. These missions will require technology solutions for crew health care to address physiological, psychological, performance, and other needs in-situ, e.g., self-sufficiency, since real-time medical support from the earth, and emergency evacuation will not be available. Onboard personal health-tracking tools for health monitoring, health risk assessment and management will be needed for the crews in order to predict his/her future health conditions. Therefore, missions beyond LEO will require a new generation of capabilities and systems, which will be built upon existing capabilities and incorporate technologies yet to be developed. Lynntech proposes image-based photoplethysmography, in combination with, smart machine-learning algorithms which will primarily utilize onboard high-quality video cameras. The proposed system will: (1) constantly monitor vital physiological signs data, (2) ensure their acceptability,  (3) identify their unusual or abnormal patterns, (4) perform diagnosis and prognosis, as well as, (5) provide necessary risk mitigation and medical intervention options to maintain crew performance optimal and sustained throughout the mission.	14982

Hybrid Approach for Modeling Chemical Kinetics and Turbulence Effects on Combustion-Instability, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Combustion instabilities pose a significant technical risk in thedevelopment of liquid and solid rocket motors. Much of the effort inmodeling combustion instabilities has focused either on systems-leveltools, or use of detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulateall the involved processes. The important effects of finite-ratechemical kinetics and turbulence-chemistry interactions have beenneglected in combustion instability modeling. In this xxxxxx project, CFDxxxxxxearch Corporation (CFDRC) will team up with Gloyer-xxxxxxxxxxxxoratories (GTL) to develop a hybrid approach by combining CFDcapabilities with a systems-level instability modeling approach, thelatter based on the xxxxxxersal Combustion Device Stability (UCDS)process.  These capabilities will be used to quantify the effects offinite-rate chemistry and turbulence-chemistry interactions oncombustion instabilities. In xxxxxx I, feasibility of the proposedapproach will be demonstrated by combining 2-D xxxxxx Averaged Navierxxxxxx and xxxxxx computations with the UCDS framework.In xxxxxx, the instability analysis will be enhanced by coupling: (1)3-D CFD analysis; and (2) xxxxxx UCDS process with more accuratetreatment of boundary conditions and the flame.  The proposed approachwill enable an accurate combustion instability analysis of rocketmotors, gas turbine combustors, and ramjet and scramjet engines.	14988
Improving Habitability, Mood & Diet through Bioregenerative Food Systems	2017-08-01	2018-07-19	During spaceflight, mealtime plays a primary role in psychological well-being of the crew by contributing to stress reduction, boredom relief and group unity. During long duration exploration missions, vegetarian diets will be adopted, creating a challenge to meet the psychological need for dietary variety. Growing edible plants provides nutritional benefits and enhances variety and composition of food. Currently, pre-packaged food is the foundation of the astronauts food system and the capability to supply fresh foods is very limited. xxxxxxregenerative Food xxxxxxs will provide the necessary nutrients needed for the astronauts survival and will enhance the psychological well-being of the crew.One cause of nutritional deficiencies in astronauts and the consequential health effects is inadequate food intake. This can be partially attributed to the effects of spaceflight on appetite, operational constraints and food acceptability. Growing fresh foods will enhance habitability and diet including: nutrition, food acceptability, dining experience and crew mood. The prevention of crew performance decrement and illness due to inadequate food systems can be accomplished with a xxxxxxregenerative Food xxxxxx.xxxxxxs have reported that caring for plants is an enjoyable activity. xxxxxxts also provide an important link to Earth, exploiting the sensory enrichment of nature to contrast the stark and sterile machine environment typical of space habitats. It is hypothesized that xxxxxxregenerative Food xxxxxxs provide a double benefit to the crews well-being both through consumption of fresh foods and through Human-xxxxxxt Interactions.The first component of my research investigates the health benefits and human factors involved in food production and which Human-xxxxxxt Interactions the crew enjoys and benefits from the most. This will provide a better understanding of which tasks should be automated and how automation can reduce the workload for undesirable tasks. The second component involves developing growth automation strategies achieved through robotics and computer data processing. I will conduct some of these experiments using a commercial AeroGarden system that has different levels of automation. xxxxxxfications will be made to the AeroGarden to enhance its automation capabilities using robotic and sensing platforms being developed collaboratively at the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx at xxxxxx. The automation strategies will involve studying Human-Computer Interactions and Human-Robotic Interactions to optimize the use of crew time, vehicle resources and to increase food production reliability and self-sufficiency. The third component of my research will investigate the integration of xxxxxxregenerative Food xxxxxxs into the space habitat to improve habitability and to minimize habitat resource utilization.My research findings will influence future space habitat architecture. The determination of crew health benefits from direct xxxxxxregenerative Food xxxxxx integration into the habitat (opposed to separate growth chambers) and how automation can positively contribute to a robust food system is a pinnacle technical development needed to extend the human presence into the solar system. Additionally, my proposed research of xxxxxxregenerative Food xxxxxxs is aligned with research that xxxxxx has identified as part of the critical path for long duration human space exploration.	14989

Mutlifunctional Fibers for Energy Storage in Advanced EVA Systems, Phase II	2008-12-01	2018-07-19	The overall objective of the xxxxxx effort is to demonstrate prototype multifunctional EVA system power patches that integrate energy storage into advanced space suit systems' components (suit and pack) to increase functionality and decrease weight and volume. The program will optimize materials and plasma processes to bridge the performance gap between current fiber and planar batteries. xxxxxximized fiber batteries will be integrated into prototypes relevant to anticipated xxxxxx missions. Successful completion of the xxxxxx will lead to an engineering demonstration unit that powers a distributed sensor under conditions that are compatible with anticipated missions. Additional integrated power pack designs such as composites based on fiber batteries will be also evaluated. The lessons learned in this effort will establish guidelines for effective development and transition of future generations of MFF into EVA systems and other applications.	14991
A Geospatial Decision Support System Toolkit, Phase II	2017-05-01	2018-07-19	"We propose to build and commercialize a working prototype xxxxxx Decision Support Toolkit (Geoxxxxxx). Geoxxxxxx will enable scientists, agencies, and stakeholders to create and deploy their own web based applications containing maps, forms, algorithms, and a rich set of functionality related to visualization, analysis, reporting, querying, and publication of geospatial data and information. Geoxxxxxx is intended for customers who are experts in a particular area or problem; have in mind a set of users who will use their site to address a specific problem; have in mind a particular workflow that they want the users to perform and datasets they want to utilize; do not necessarily know or want to know about geospatial data types, formats, operations, and structure; and do not necessarily know or want to know how to construct a web-based application. The mission of Geoxxxxxx is to reduce and eventually remove technical barriers that limit direct stakeholder control over the creation and management of geospatially enabled web applications. AGS has worked on numerous geospatial web based applications and services, and continues to have active projects in this area. Our xxxxxx Geoxxxxxx proposal is to create the technological foundation for the distributed \"open source xxxxxx development framework\" that xxxxxx envisions as described in the 2015 xxxxxx S5.02 xxxxxx solicitation."	14992
Prognostic Performance Metrics	2013-03-20	2018-07-19	This chapter presents several performance metrics for offline evaluation of prognostics algorithms. A brief overview of different methods employed for performance evaluation is also included. Because metrics developed in the context of forecasting differ from prognostics in the systems health management context and to account for the additional considerations, metrics specialized for prognostics (but not necessarily for the applica- tion) are needed. These metrics were introduced, and their use was illus- trated with recommendations.	14993

High Power CubeSat Control Sub-system (HPoCCS), Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	To date, most CubeSat designs have been 6U or smaller and have operated within power budgets in the 10s of W or less. xxxxxxver, as the demand grows for greater CubeSat performance for all forms of research, operational, and commercial applications in upcoming years, these sensor-sats will require higher levels of power generation and power management. Low-cost access to space, fueled by the agile and ever more capable CubeSat supply, will consume a larger and larger portion of the space market in the near future for Earth and solar system targeted missions. As described in the xxxxxx xxxxxx S3.03, ?xxxxxx xxxxxxs Management? solicitation, xxxxxx is preparing for this opportunity and condition by seeking development of high power (xxxxxx) management systems that are compatible with 3U and larger volumes and that minimize impact of the on-orbit operations and orientation of the spacecraft.In response to this call, ASTRA proposes to develop a next generation, high power CubeSat-compatible electrical power sub-system (xxxxxx) called the High xxxxxx CubeSat Control xxxxxx-xxxxxx (HPoCCS).

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping for Planetary Surface Mobility, Phase I	2012-02-01	2018-07-19	Protoxxxxxxovations, LLC and Carnegie Mellon xxxxxxersity have formed a partnership to commercially develop localization and mapping technologies for planetary rovers. Our first aim is to provide a reliable means of localization that is independent of infrastructure, such as GPS, and compatible with requirements of missions to planetary surfaces. Simultaneously solving for the precise location of the rover as it moves while building an accurate map of the environment is an optimization problem involving internal sensing, sensing of the surrounding environment, probabilistic optimization methods, efficient data structures, and a robust implementation. Our second aim is to merge simultaneous localization and mapping (xxxxxx) technologies with our existing Reliable Autonomous xxxxxx Mobility (xxxxxx) architecture for rover navigation. Our unique partnership brings together state-of-the-art technologies for xxxxxx with experience in delivering and supporting both autonomous systems and mobility platforms for xxxxxx.Our proposed project will create a xxxxxx framework that is capable of accurately localizing a rover throughout long, multi-kilometer traverses of barren terrain. Our approach is compatible with limited communication and computing resources expected for missions to planetary surfaces. Our technology is based on innovative representations of evidence grids, particle-filter algorithms that operate on range data rather than explicit features, and strategies for segmenting large evidence grids into manageable pieces. In this project we will evaluate the maturity of these algorithms, developed for research programs at Carnegie Mellon, and incorporate them into our xxxxxx architecture, thus providing portable and reliable localization for a variety of vehicle platforms and sensors. Mission constraints will vary broadly, so our xxxxxx components will be able to merge readings from various suites of sensors that may be found on planetary rovers.	14999

Low-Fiend Vector Magnetometer (V-400-LF), Phase I	2011-08-01	2018-07-19	This 2010 xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx proposal for an innovative Low-Field xxxxxx (V-400-LF) is a response to subtopic xxxxxx and Field xxxxxxs and xxxxxxent Enabling Technologies. The V-400-LF instrument is intended for making high-resolution magnetic field measurements of planets and in interplanetary space on small satellites and spacecraft. The xxxxxx effort includes development of designs for advanced miniaturized components and a conceptual design for a miniaturized V-400-LF instrument in order to establish the feasibility of designing and fabricating a prototype V 400-LF in xxxxxx 2. xxxxxx-pumped helium magnetometers have proven to be world-class instruments for measuring the direction and magnitude of the geomagnetic and planetary fields. The V-400-LF will build on the heritage of the Low-field xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxometer (LVHM), the Scalar xxxxxx xxxxxxometer (SHM), and the laser-pumped vector/scalar Self-calibrating xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxometer (SVHM). The goal of xxxxxx is development of a conceptual design for a miniaturized instrument appropriate for small spacecraft and microsatellites. This miniaturization will be accomplished through the use of advanced miniaturized components and packaging methods for the V-400-LF xxxxxx and xxxxxxnics. The V-400-LF can be used to measure vector components of low magnetic fields, scalar gradients (difference of vector magnitude measurements from two V-400-LF instruments), and gradient tensor elements (difference between vector components using three or more instruments) with very high stability and accuracy. The V-400-LF will have a dynamic range of +/- 1,000 nT, a sensitivity of 10 pT/rtHz at 1 Hz, and a calibrated accuracy of +/- 0.5 nT. The sample rate will be 430 Hz. The xxxxxx is expected to be 4 at the end of the xxxxxx contract.	15005
Modeling and Mitigating Spatial Disorientation in Low g Environments	2011-08-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx was 'packaged' as a DLL (dynamically linked library) within SDAT.  SDAT users can select whether they wish to use xxxxxx algorithms for predicted perception, or SDAT's algorithms.  While xxxxxx may be more physiologically accurate, xxxxxx requires data sets to be of a fixed rate and fairly high frequency (10-100 Hz).  Unfortunately, actual vehicle flight data recordings rarely meet these requirements.  In addition, xxxxxx does not account for misperceptions due to sub-threshold motions, which are critical to many SDAT illusion models.  Therefore, we give users the option to select xxxxxx or SDAT algorithms for attitude perception predictions.    We designed three new illusion models to SDAT based upon vertical landing vehicle scenarios that we observed in data sets provided by an anonymous source of helicopter data -- data sets that included confirmed SD events.  The three models are:  (1) \"Undetected loss of lift\" which occurs when the pilot unwittingly flies out of ground effect with insufficient thrust to maintain the new altitude, resulting in a sudden plunge toward the surface; (2) \"Inadvertent drift during hover\" that could result in the vehicle striking an obstacle; and (3) \"Undetected drift during landing\" that could cause the vehicle to tip-over.    SDAT has also been enhanced with a pilot attention model called N-SEEV.  N-SEEV elevates applied countermeasures when SDAT predicts that the pilot is suffering from SD and has not attended to a lower level of countermeasures.  We created an updated version of SDAT's user manual and delivered SDAT and its user manual to NSBRI.  We did not undertake an experiment to validate the newly enhanced SDAT because we could use existing data sets plus the new ones acquired from our anonymous source of helicopter data sets.  We also judged that a simulator validation experiment would use resources needed to do the best possible job of integrating xxxxxx into SDAT.    FORT tool cost scores are not integrated into SDAT because it is inappropriate to do so; they could be integrated into xxxxxx.  The FORT tool remains a separate stand-alone tool.  We performed additional FORT tool validation, and submitted an article to the xxxxxx Journal.    We received 40 usable survey responses, analyzed the data from the 71 missions in the responses, and submitted an article to Aviation, xxxxxx, and Environmental Medicine reporting our method and results.  We also sent de-identified data to our customer, xxxxxx-JSC's Dr. xxxxxx, and will make the full set of de-identified data available to anyone who wishes it."	15006
UltraForm Finisher Optical Mandrel Fabrication, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	The requirements for cost effective manufacturing and metrology of normal incidence and grazing incidence xxxxxx optical surfaces is instrumental for the success of future xxxxxx programs such as xxxxxx, WFIRST, NGXO and X-ray Surveyor. Our plan in this xxxxxx I effort would be to implement our xxxxxxForm Finishing (UFF) (a sub-aperture compliant wheel and belt type polishing process for rapid material removal from the ground/machined state to a finished work piece), with a new work piece rotary axis configuration.  The UFF rapidly removes residual grinding & cutter marks and sub-surface damage, while providing a robust solution for surface corrections on the required X-ray mandrels and cylindrical shells. Our UFF process was initially developed for high speed finishing of hard ceramic plano components and is now producing impressive test results for smoothing of critical aspheric components. xxxxxxiPro's technologically advanced optical manufacturing capabilities, along with our strong university and industry partnerships, gives us a very strong team and a clear path towards developing and commercializing the platforms which solve the difficult challenges associated with the fabrication of these large complex mirrors and cylindrical shells.  The fabrication of shells with the electroforming process and glass replication process require very accurate mandrels. The proposed xxxxxx I plan will include the design, manufacture and assembly of a precision rotary axis.  The rotary axis will be tested on a host xxxxxxiPro UFF optical fabrication platform while polishing an xxxxxx. The part geometry will be measured with xxxxxxiPro's 'xxxxxxSurf' a non-contact free-form measurement system. We envision that the work done during xxxxxx I will be extended during xxxxxx to hyperbolic or elliptical shaped mirror surfaces. This research will position us with the information needed to develop the machine platforms needed for the fabrication and test of large mirrors and mandrels.	15007
Improved Models and Tools for Prediction of Radiation Effects on Space Electronics in Wide Temperature Range, Phase II	2009-11-01	2018-07-19	All xxxxxx exploration systems operate in the extreme environments of space and require reliable electronics capable of handling a wide temperature range (-180ºC to +130ºC) and high radiation levels. To design low-temperature radiation-hardened (rad-hard) electronics and predict circuit and system characteristics, such as error rates, modeling tools are required at multiple levels. To determine the electrical responses of transistors and circuits to radiation events, physics-based xxxxxx Computer Aided Design (TCAD) and mixed-level tools are required. This project will provide models and tools that will improve capabilities for prediction of technology-dependent responses to radiation in wide temperature range, which will lead to better design of rad-hard electronics, better anticipation of design margins, and reduction of testing cost and time. Future xxxxxx missions will use nanometer-scale electronic technologies which call for a shift in how radiation effects in such devices and circuits are viewed. xxxxxx-scale electronic device responses are strongly related to the microstructure of the radiation event. This requires a more detailed physics-based modeling approach, which will provide information for higher-level engineering models used in integrated circuit (IC) and system design. Hence, the proposed innovation: detailed high-energy-physics-based simulations of radiation events (using MRED/xxxxxx software from xxxxxx xxxxxxersity) efficiently integrated with advanced device/circuit response computations by CFDRC xxxxxxTCAD three-dimensional (3D) mixed-level simulator. This will also enable a large number of statistically meaningful runs on a massively parallel supercomputing cluster. The extreme low temperature physics models combined with radiation effects will be validated with the help of consultant, Dr. xxxxxx (xxxxxx Tech), in collaboration with the xxxxxx Extreme Environment xxxxxxnics program, and serving the xxxxxx RHESE Program (led by xxxxxx-MSFC).	15008

A working title for this new tool is ?Apache.? Apache will be a platform-independent and user-friendly tool that eliminates piecewise optimization. A key to Apache?s versatility and extensibility is the use of object-oriented xxxxxx language.

At the heart of this framework is the use of an order statistics-based approach to build communities with hierarchical structure. We have also carefully considered privacy concerns of the peers and adopted cryptographic protocols to measure similarity between them without disclosing their personal profiles. We evaluated our framework on a distributed data mining platform we have developed. The experimental results show that our framework could effectively build interests-based communities.	15012
Flight Dynamic Simulation with Nonlinear Aeroelastic Interaction using the ROM-ROM Procedure, Phase II	2013-09-01	2018-07-19	ZONA xxxxxx, xxxxxx. proposes to develop an integrated flight dynamics simulation capability with nonlinear aeroelastic interactions by combining a flight dynamics model and an add-on nonlinear aeroelastic solver in a xxxxxx environment.  This nonlinear aeroelastic solver is generated by interacting a nonlinear structural xxxxxxd Order xxxxxx (ROM) with a Neural-xxxxxx-based (NN-based) aerodynamic ROM and a gust ROM to provide the incremental aeroelastic forces and moments of a classical flight dynamics model. In this way, the flight dynamics model is kept with minimum changes so that this integrated flight dynamics simulation remains in the frame work of a 6-degrees-of-freedom simulation environment.  The nonlinear structural ROM employs an ELSTEP/FAT procedure that operates on a commercial nonlinear finite element software to construct the nonlinear stiffness matrices.  The NN-based and gust aerodynamic ROM is generated using a system identification technique operating on a CFD code to evaluate the weights and biases in a two-layer feed-forward NN system.  The end product is called FuNL-DFS that can simulate the key aeroelastic coupling mechanism between nonlinear structural dynamics and nonlinear unsteady aerodynamics with classical rigid body dynamics and can be used for control law development, maneuvering flight simulation, flight loads prediction and handling quality assessment. The FuNL-DFS system will be validated with the flight test data of the Predator B xxxxxx.	15013
DURACON - Variable Emissivity Broadband Coatings for Liquid Propellant Rocket Nozzles, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	The need exists for a fast drying, robust, low gloss, black, high emissivity coating that can be applied easily on aircraft rocket nozzles and nozzle extensions.  xxxxxx on their 40+ years of experience with loaded polymers, particle dispersion and surface gloss control, scientists at Materials Technologies Corporation recently developed DURACON&#61652;, a high emissivity, high thermal diffusivity, low-gloss infrared black coating.

Aromatic Thermosetting coPolyester Composites for High Temperature and Cryogenic Applications, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxanced composite materials processable by cost-effective manufacturing play an important role in developing lightweight structures for future exploratory missions. With growing demand for improved mission performance and reductions vehicle mass, advances in polymer systems with extreme thermo-mechanical properties are critical. The primary objective of ATSP xxxxxxovations' xxxxxx I work will be to fabricate and test low cost aromatic thermosetting copolyesters (ATSP): (1) for high performance composite structures for high temperature applications, (2) with high resistance to microcracking at cryogenic temperatures for use in next generation spacecraft missions. Our team partner, the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) will assist ATSP xxxxxxovations to perform advanced characterization and provide technical support for this project.  ATSP xxxxxxovations and UIUC have developed ATSP for high performance composites that are stable at high temperatures and have an intrinsic resistance to microcracking. The liquid crystallinity of the polymer results in a local matching of CTE between fiber and matrix yielding minimal thermal residual stress in composites and higher fracture toughness than current resin systems. These capabilities allow the ATSP to address a wide range of current and future applications (at both cryogenic and high temperature regimes) critical to future xxxxxx missions. The synthetic development of ATSP was a major innovation in the field of polymer science. ATSP shows excellent performance as adhesives, flame resistant foams, and tribological wear coatings. ATSP resins possess the unique attribute among high temperature thermosets of solid-state bonding in a fully cured state to produce chemically contiguous specimens by Interchain Transesterification Reaction (ITR). This may open new modes of fabrication with relevance to xxxxxx missions and the wider aerospace industry.	15015

The approach exploits prior knowledge about the undamaged aircraft to reduce the order of the estimation problem. Test maneuvers will be designed to improve the observability of the system dynamics. The derived performance model will then be used to determine the aircraft flight envelope, performance parameters and the maneuver limits. The objective is to develop an aircraft performance model online to permit the derivation of viable landing guidance laws for damaged aircraft.    xxxxxx I research will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept using a xxxxxx-supplied aircraft simulation. xxxxxx aircraft performance estimation system will be developed during the xxxxxx research and evaluated in real-time, high-fidelity simulations.	15019

Cathode Coupling Physics in a Hall Thruster	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	As humankind seeks to reach xxxxxx and beyond, advancement of electric propulsion (EP) will be a key factor in the pursuit of deep-space exploration. EP uses acceleration methods (electrostatic and electromagnetic), which do not rely on the conversion of heat to kinetic energy. Thus, EP achieves higher specific impulses than chemical propulsion through the acceleration of ionized particles. Among EP devices, magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters can provide the high-specific impulse, high-power propulsion required to enable ambitious exploration missions to xxxxxx and beyond. Despite their potential advantages, MPD thrusters have not demonstrated efficiencies near theoretical predictions, which may be due to the 'anode fall' and 'onset' phenomena.The proposed work is to investigate an MPD thruster with a suitable magnetic nozzle that can overcome the limitations imposed by anode fall and onset by controlling the field properties of the plasma in appropriate region of the nozzle and discharge chamber. Computational modeling provides a detailed understanding of the complex physical mechanisms. xxxxxx magnetohydrodynamics models compared to experimental data will provide in-depth understanding of the limiting factors in the MPD thruster and useful insights for an optimal nozzle design. Finally, the proposed nozzle design will be tested numerically and experimentally.The proposed work will improve the overall efficiency of the thruster, critically aid in the development and characterization of next generation MPD thrusters, and contribute to advancing EP for more distant and critical space missions in the future.	15024

Uninhabited Traffic Management System Evaluator (UTME), Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The key innovation of this effort is the development of an Uninhabited Aerial xxxxxx (UAS) Traffic Manager Evaluator (UTME) specifically targeted at evaluating potential air traffic systems for handling low-altitude UAS flights.  It has been estimated that over 90% of future UAS flights will be low altitude (less than 6,000 feet above ground level).  At such low altitudes, the conventional air traffic management systems are ineffective, primarily because both communication and surveillance coverage is limited at those low altitudes, and communication latencies among the controller, remote pilot, and UAS vehicle will be higher than controllers are accustomed to today.  Therefore the current approach of treating low-altitude piloted  flights distant from a major airport with xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxs (delegating separation to the pilot in visual meteorological condition) may lead to unacceptably low levels of safety (high probability of accidents). In part because of these concerns, xxxxxx is considering developing a low-altitude air traffic control system specifically for UAS flights&#151;what is called here a system for UAS Traffic Management, or UTM.   But how should such a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) system be structured?  What are the fundamental requirements?  How can different proposals for handling such traffic be evaluated?  A UTM evaluator, which is the system proposed herein, will help answer these questions.	15026
"Demonstration of \"Optical Mining\" For Excavation of Asteroids and Production of Mission Consumables, Phase I"	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	"This xxxxxx xxxxxx-1 project will demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative breakthrough in ISRU methods that we call \"xxxxxxical Mining\".  xxxxxxical mining is an approach to simultaneously excavating carbonaceous chondrite asteroid surfaces and driving water and other volatiles out of the excavated material and into an enclosing inflatable bag without the need for complex or impractical robotics.  In optical mining, highly concentrated sunlight is delivered to the surface of the asteroid through a mechanically simple but optically sophisticated system of reflective non-imaging optics. The highly concentrated optical energy ablates the surface in a controlled way analogous to how intense lasers can ablate surfaces  constantly exposing new material and forcing water out of the ablated material.      xxxxxxical mining is part of a mission concept that ICS Associates has developed called Apis (Asteroid Provided xxxxxx xxxxxxs). Apis is a commercially viable approach to the extraction, processing, and delivery of water from asteroids to in-space assets. Mission system studies show that Apis can extract up to 100MT of water from an accessible near Earth asteroid and deliver it to xxxxxx Distant Retrograde Orbit (LDRO) based on the launch of just one modest sized spacecraft from a single Falcon 9 rocket. The Apis mission concept depends on the completion of the proposed xxxxxx work. In this xxxxxx-1 xxxxxx we will develop a facility to simulate and demonstrate key aspects of optical mining to show the mission system feasibility of Apis and provide a breakthrough in ISRU and space transportation for xxxxxx. We will do this by upgrading an existing xenon arc lamp and vacuum system and using the optical energy from the lamp to simulate optical mining on asteroid materials in vacuum.  We will perform experiments to validate the process by optically ablating the surfaces of meteorite samples and asteroid simulations under carefully controlled and observed conditions."	15027

Two Phase Flow Tools for Solid Motors with Dynamic Burning Surface Recession, Phase I	2010-01-01	2018-07-19	The challenges of designing, developing, and fielding advanced propulsion systems continue to increase as xxxxxx Vision for xxxxxx Exploration Program moves forward with new solid propulsion elements ({i.e., xxxxxx I and V).  Our existing computational tool for solid motor analysis (BurnSurf) generates modest surface recession, but the mesh deformation techniques employed often fail as the surface regression increases, particularly near corners.  For complex grain designs with highly complicated surface topologies (e.g., star shapes), simple mesh deformation is no longer desirable.  Our proposed innovation will utilize surface mesh modification and volume mesh generation to locally rebuild the burning surface mesh and the adjacent volume mesh.  The innovation will address integrated surface and volume mesh regeneration and reconnection techniques for modifying mesh topologies along with two phase burning surface models to create a unique 3D software tool for next generation solid motor internal environment characterization.  Our research products will provide xxxxxx with the important capability to simultaneously analyze solid propellant combustion, heat transfer, and grain burnback within a single framework.  We will demonstrate feasibility of the approach using a two phase grain burning model coupled with surface recession for a simple shape in the xxxxxx range of 3-4.	15030

A new spray-flamelet formulation will be incorporated into xxxxxx. The particular advantages of this formulation are (i) its consistency with the single-phase flamelet-formulation (already available in xxxxxx), (ii) its formulation in mixture-fraction space, overcoming the non-uniqueness of the classical mixture-fraction parameterization, and (iii) its applicability to finite xxxxxx-number, thereby accounting for particle evaporation, slip-velocity, and poly-dispersed spray-phase.

Task-Method-Knowledge Toolkit for Spacecraft Launch & Payload Processing System, Phase I	2002-05-01	2018-07-19	The objective of this proposal is to investigate how xxxxxxxxxxxxTM, aknowledge acquisition tool for capturing, representing and automatingstrategic knowledge, can be applied to spacecraft launch and payloadprocessing (SL&amp;PP).  Primary focus will be placed on capturingknowledge and rationale for facilitating spacecraft launch and payloadprocessing.  xxxxxxxxxxxx allows process engineers to identify controlprocesses. It also enables graphical display of the control processesand algorithms. This can, and should be, immensely useful for spacecraftlaunch and payload process engineers and operators.  The xxxxxxxxxxxxinterface allows the engineer to simulate and monitor a process as itexecutes, which means that needed changes can be identified andcorrected without recoding.  This potentially saves time and effort, andbecause the control process is explicitly represented as knowledge, itcan be stored, manipulated, shared, and edited as knowledge.  Here weinvestigate how xxxxxxxxxxxxTM can support SL&amp;PP and how it can beenhanced to better support SL&amp;PP in the future.	15039

Distributed Aerostructural Sensing and Control	2016-07-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx researchers are investigating ways to increase aircraft maneuverability, safety, and fuel efficiency by the application of networks of smart sensors distributed across an aircraft. This \"fly by feel\" concept could enable a vehicle to autonomously react to changes in aerodynamic and structural conditions through the use of distributed pliable membrane sensors that obtain real-time information and convert it into aerodynamic information that can be used for adaptive flight control. In comparison with conventional sensing technologies, which measure aerodynamic parameters from an aircraft's fuselage only, these smart sensors enable localized measurements at nearly any surface on an aircraft structure. For example, hot film sensors could be placed at wing transition points to measure shear stress or along the leading edge of a wing to measure velocity and angle of attack. The ultimate goal is to feed real-time sensor information into a control scheme such that the aircraft can autonomously control the position of a surface appropriately for active aeroelastic wing control. Work to date: The team is conducting sensing and analysis work with hot film sensors: 1) wind tunnel tests at xxxxxx A&M xxxxxxersity on a wing outfitted with hot film sensors and subjected to wind gusts 2) hot film sensors on the leading edge of a Gulfstream xxxxxx wing to measure transitions between the leading edge and the control flap 3) wind tunnel tests on a wing section of the X56 aircraft 4) hot film sensors installed on the leading edge of an xxxxxx aircraft. Looking ahead: Next steps involve more investigative work with the X56 aircraft, specifically hot film sensors combined with fiber optic strain sensing and associated data fusion algorithms to address distributed sensing and control applications. Partners: xxxxxx A&M xxxxxxersity for wind tunnel tests, xxxxxx Institute of xxxxxx for computational studies augmented with xxxxxx Institute of xxxxxx wind tunnel tests, xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxing and Mechanics for distributed aeroelastic control Benefits Autonomous: Could enable real-time performance-based measurements xxxxxx: Could permit revolutionary capabilities across a wide speed range, including but not limited to shorter takeoff and landing even to near-stall conditions, safe and reliable supersonic operation, larger passenger and cargo capacity over increased range xxxxxx safety: Provides localized data, enabling engineers to be more confident that design specifications offer appropriate safety margins Certifiable performance and stability guarantees Aerostructural efficiency xxxxxx testing and design xxxxxx interaction for formation flying and increased landing density at airports xxxxxx drag reduction and increased lift performance xxxxxx aeroelastic control of flexible structures"	15041
ESPRIT: Exercise Sensing and Pose Recovery Inference Tool, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop ESPRIT: an Exercise Sensing and Pose Recovery Inference Tool, in support of xxxxxx effort in developing crew exercise technologies for astronaut health and fitness. ESPRIT is a single camera system that monitors the exercise activities of the crew, detects markers placed on the body and other image features, recovers 3D kinematic information of the human body pose, and compiles statistical data about the exercise activities. There are two main challenges for motion capture using a single camera: (1) lack of depth information, and (2) partial occlusion of parts of the body. To overcome these challenges, the proposed framework relies on strong priors on human body pose, shape, and motion dynamics to resolve pose ambiguities. Besides marker locations, it extracts other image features that provide additional cues for recovering pose. It combines both discriminative and generative approaches to achieve robust pose estimation and tracking performance.	15042

The NIRPCS will have near zero read noise and dark rates below the read noise to support photon counting for frame capture times as high as 10 seconds.  Up to xxxxxx frames can be sequentially captured and digitally averaged.  Important xxxxxx applications for the NIRPCS include spectral measurements on extra-solar planets in search of water and bio-markers and measuring the dynamics of galaxies at high redshift to better understand the formation process.  The technical objectives of xxxxxx I in the development of the NIRPCS include i) determine which sensor components from an existing NIR sensor must be optimized to achieve NIR photon counting performance of frame capture times as lone as 10 seconds; and ii) create technical specifications for a NIRPCS prototype that would be developed under a xxxxxx xxxxxx program.

Low cost corrosion and oxidation resistant coatings for improved system reliability, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	In order to improve high-temperature oxidation and corrosion resistance of critical superalloy components in turbine engines innovative processing methods must be devised to improve coating and materials properties at a higher reliability and lower costs. Whether or not thermal barrier coating are applied to the engine components, the resistance to oxidation and hot corrosion relies on metallic coatings protecting the superalloy substrate. These metallic coatings are commonly either diffusion aluminides or MCrAlY overlays (where M=Ni, Co, Fe, Ni+Co, etc). Compared with diffusion coatings, MCrAlY coatings are more flexible in terms of composition selection for achieving a more balanced combination of coating properties and having a lower ductile to brittle transition temperature, which makes them more resistant to cracking upon thermal cycling. Several techniques have been developed to deposit MCrAlY coatings including physical vapor deposition, electrolytic codeposition, electrophoresis, and autocatalytic electroless deposition, of which electrolytic codeposition appears to be a promising, low cost, non-line of sight approach. Therefore, the overall objective of the xxxxxx I and II programs is to create a scalable cost effective process to produce coatings that can enhance high temperature reliability and corrosion/oxidation and erosion resistance. This program will build off of Dr. xxxxxx (xxxxxx Technological xxxxxxersity) electrolytic codeposition work and Faraday xxxxxx's alloy coating development efforts to create a scalable process to electrolytic codeposit MCrAlY onto engine shaped components and to investigate other potential MCrAlX alloy elements that could further increase the coatings temperature resistance. If successful this program has the potential to greatly improve the oxidation and corrosion resistance of metallic coatings while also improving their reliability at higher operating temperatures and reducing their manufacturing costs.	15044
Multilevel Control & Optimization of Future Air Traffic Systems via Managem	2013-01-01	2018-07-19	We investigate solutions to problems of air traffic control subject to real-world limitations on the computational/communication cost of finding that solution. The approach involves direct quantification of controllability of the system via establishing a set of comprehensive physical constraints on trajectory calculations. We develop practical and quantifiable measures of controllability and complexity to facilitate provability of system safety and inform the needs of functional allocation.xxxxxx air traffic on all temporal and spatial scales – from a single aircraft to the entire airspace – can be formally stated as a dynamic, high-dimensional optimization problem with many objectives and constraints based on physics, economics, information, and other considerations. Especially in the future NAS, attempting to find the optimal solution to such problems as they arise during operations would often violate practical constraints such as computation time and/or communication resources. The issue is how to find the best solution subject to such constraints on the solution-finding algorithm. We propose to approach this as a multilevel optimization problem, where a complexity measure F maps the combination of s and an algorithm alpha (e.g., an algorithm that searches over a specified class of fine-grained traffic flows all having a given large-scale flow) to whether applying alpha to s would violate the practical constraints. Given F, the higher level optimization problem identifies the member of a set A of candidate algorithms that has best likely value of the objective functions, subject to provided practical constraints on the algorithm. A lower level optimizer then runs that algorithm and by construction is likely to do so within the given practical constraints. The technical approach will use mathematical programming, Probability Collectives (PC), and xxxxxx Learning (ML), among other areas. The ultimate goal is a methodology and tools for use both in research and as a decision-making aid for all system participants, including aircraft pilots and automatic systems, air traffic controllers, and airlines.	15045

cFS-based Autonomous Requirements Testing Tool, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	The S&K xxxxxx proposes design of a tool suite, Autonomy xxxxxx Tester (ART), to address the difficulty of stating autonomous requirements and the links to clear testing plans. ART will represent autonomy requirements, test plans, and test results, and the relationships among them so that it is less difficult to state autonomy requirements clearly, to communicate test plans clearly among the full development team, to guide software development from requirements through acceptance tests, and to communicate test results in terms of the completeness with which the requirements have been tested. This will extend the state of the art by clarifying the progression from autonomy requirements to test results and make the tests more modular and reusable.The S&K team will first identify representative autonomy requirements for a design reference mission and high-level descriptions of how to test those requirements in the developed system. The team will then design XML schemas to represent data structures that define autonomy requirements, related test objectives, related cFS messages, test specifications and results. Next, they identify ways to generate and execute those tests by publishing and subscribing to appropriate cFS messages to run tests and examine the results.  The S&K team will design information displays for showing relationship among requirements, test designs and results so that it is clear how thoroughly the autonomy requirements have been tested and how they performed.  The team will develop a concept of operations for ART.  They will prototype enough of the concept to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, write a final report, and deliver results along with submission of a xxxxxx proposal.	15047
High-Speed Neutron and Gamma Flux Sensor for Monitoring Surface Nuclear Reactors, Phase II	2013-05-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx needs compact nuclear reactors to power future bases on the moon and/or xxxxxx. These reactors require robust automatic control systems using low mass, rapid response, in-core reactor power monitoring sensors and radiation tolerant sensor interrogation systems that do not yet exist.  Luna proposes to develop a new type of fiber optic miniature neutron flux and gamma flux sensor, which will have significantly faster response than recently developed fiber optic radiation sensors.  The new sensors will maintain the advantages of current fiber optic reactor sensor technology, including small size for in-core sensor distributions, high temperature performance (above 600oC), and immunity to electrical noise in the presence of ionizing radiation.  During xxxxxx Luna will optimize the sensor design and the interrogation system for high temperature in-core monitoring of both gamma flux and neutron flux with internal thermal compensation and in-situ thermal calibration. At the end of xxxxxx, Luna will deliver a lightweight sensor interrogation system, utilizing experimentally verified radiation hardened components wherever possible, and including an analog output signal for interfacing with standard reactor control electronics.	15048
MGN V RSS LINE OF SIGHT ACCELERATION PROFILES V1.13	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	xxxxxx Acceleration Profile xxxxxx Records (LOSAPDR) consist of data from xxxxxx tracking of the orbiting spacecraft. The relative motion of the spacecraft and the earth-based radio receiver is measured very precisely, and known motions are removed a priori (i.e. earth rotation, planetary motions, spacecraft orbital motion, solar pressure, drag), leaving small velocity changes caused by variations in the mass distribution of the planet. The residual xxxxxx frequency shifts are linearly proportional to the component of velocity in the Earth direction. Numerical differentiation of these velocity residuals with respect to time produces line-of-sight (LOS) gravity. These measures are accelerations at spacecraft altitude which can be modeled for geophysical interpretation. For information on xxxxxx gravity investigations see papers in [ICARUSMGN1994].	15049

New Technology for Gas Absorption	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	The proposed research aims to develop technologies to make gas absorption systems for carbon dioxide or other waste gases smaller and more lightweight through a novel gas-liquid contact mechanism. Furthermore, this technology would permit use of liquid solvents in microgravity where previously only solids were permissible. The overall goal of this proposal is understand the transport mechanics for these waste gases into and within nanometer-sized droplets. Once transport mechanics are characterized, a prototype device may be designed and tested using flight-like conditions. Finally, a full size system will be constructed and tested to ensure scale-up is performed adequately. The full size system will be capable of reduced gravity testing. xxxxxx dioxide capture is of particular interest to xxxxxx since it is the primary waste gas of human metabolism and must be controlled within any closed environment (spacecraft, spacesuit, etc.). As space vehicles have strict requirements for weight, power, pressure drop, and volume, this research aims to transform the current state-of-the-art through dramatically reducing these requirements. Moreover, cabin atmosphere (oxygen and nitrogen) waste is almost entirely eliminated even when rejecting carbon dioxide to vacuum. These goals are outlined in xxxxxx Human Health, Life Support and xxxxxxion xxxxxxs xxxxxx.	15051

The data set includes three products: 1) high-resolution spherical harmonic models of Mercury's gravity field. These results were derived from raw radio tracking data; 2) measurements of Mercury's radius at several locations around the planet. These radii are derived from radio occultations; and 3) spherical harmonic models of Mercury's surface shape. Both Mercury xxxxxx (MLA) data and occultation data were used to generate the shape models. The investigations were conducted by personnel at xxxxxx/APL, GSFC, and JPL.	15055
Innoflight Middleware System (IMS), Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx missions can benefit greatly from the use of the latest COTS processing technology in order to allow spacecraft to perform more onboard computation using less power.  This trend has accelerated in recent years due to the explosion of low-power commercial processing technology driven by mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.  Many of these advanced devices contain multiple processing cores, and some are full xxxxxx-on-xxxxxx (SoC) parts that include GPU processor arrays or FPGA fabric.xxxxxxver, while these COTS multi-core processors have tremendous capability, they are not designed to be tolerant to the radiation effects that are experienced in the space environment.  One approach to increasing the reliability of COTS processors in space is to implement redundancy within the software framework.  With this technique, the multiple cores in a processing device and even multiple independent computers can be operated in any combination of parallel processing (for enhanced performance) and redundantly (for enhanced reliability).  For this proposed project, we plan to develop the xxxxxxoflight xxxxxxdleware xxxxxx (IMS) in order to provide this capability.	15056
Blocking Filters with Enhanced Throughput for X-Ray Microcalorimetry, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	X-ray microcalorimeters have developed to provide unprecedented energy resolution and signal sensitivity. To take maximum advantage of the microcalorimeter's performance, a new and improved blocking filter stack is needed to further enhance low level sensitivity and mission throughput. The innovation proposed, high transmission polyimide support mesh fabricated using photolithography, will replace the nickel mesh used in previous blocking filter designs. The proposed mesh will be thinner than known comparable supports and will be produced freestanding such that it can be readily combined with filter foils of all types. The polyimide mesh will demonstrate at least 10% higher transmission than nickel at all energies, and will become essentially transparent above 3 keV. xxxxxx structures will be fabricated using three different photolithographic processes and compared both freestanding and in combination with filter foils to determine feasibility. The proposed innovation along with thinner materials will improve mission throughput and effective area significantly for microcalorimeter payloads on proposed Small xxxxxx missions, xxxxxx, and xxxxxx in the near term as well as Constellation-X.	15057

Electrionically Steered Antenna for Advanced RF Communications, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	Future robotic and human space exploration vehicles will be producing large quantities of data that needs transmitted between vehicles and to the ground stations.  xxxxxxver, these vehicles will be tightly constrained in size, weight, and power sources.  Traditional methods of using single function elements will not be able to meet these requirements. Therefore, advanced technologies that utilize state-of-the-art materials, packaging, and devices and components are urgently needed to minimize the size, weight, and power usage of the RF communication systems. nGimat proposes to develop high performance xxxxxx electrically steered antenna with phased array architectures using nGimat's proprietary BST based tunable dielectric materials.  BST's unique voltage tunable characteristics make them promising candidates for critical microwave components in phased array communications and radar systems such as varactors, tunable filters, and phase shifters.  The ability to efficiently change the RF complex impedance with low electrical loss could significantly impact future communication systems for both government and civilian applications.  Successful maturation of tunable materials together with associated microwave and component circuit design techniques resulting from this effort could reduce the cost while simultaneously improving the performance of future RF communication systems.  The resultant antenna will be capable of simultaneous full-duplex multiple beam operations.	15059
Development of AR/VR Capabilities for Facility and Mission Support	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	Currently challenges in facility maintenance and in implementing facility modifications/upgrades (e.g., rocket engine test stands) can be found in gaps in fully understanding the data collected about a facility due to use of multiple separate databases and inaccurate and inefficient processes further introducing errors in data. This project will explore a way to template those processes through the use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies to improve efficiencies and accuracies in interpreting facilities for modifications and adaptations to keep pace with the rapidly evolving engine test needs of the center.	15060
FY15 GRC CIF Ultra High Density Fuel Cells	2016-01-01	2018-07-19	The proposed innovation is a very lightweight fuel cell that uses passive techniques to move reactants into the fuel cell and remove the byproduct water and heat from the fuel cell. When coupled with a state-of-the-art composite cryogenic reactant tanks, the overall energy density of the fuel cell power system is projected to be approximately 1,000 watt-hr/kg which is 10X the current state-of-the-art lithium batteries. Such a dramatic increase in energy density is a disruptive and much needed breakthrough in energy storage for xxxxxx&rsquo;s portable power needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cross section of the UED fuel cell shows the fuel cell bipolar assembly and the membrane electrode assembly. The stack of cells are provided H2 and O2 on perpendicular faces of the stack. The water is separated from the incoming oxygen by micro-grooved plates that wick the water to the oxygen manifold and ultimately to the water exit of the stack where a high bubble-point gas/liquid membrane separator allows the water to leave the stack, but prevents incoming oxygen from escaping with the water. To minimize mass, the bipolar plates are expected to be made of plastic doped with an electrically conductive filler laminated with pyrolytic graphite for heat conduction, and the endplates structures are expected to be stiff corrugated plastic.	15061
Bandwidth Controllable Tunable Filter for Hyper-/Multi-Spectral Imager, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx xxxxxx I proposal introduces a fast speed bandwidth controllable tunable filter for hyper-/multi-spectral (HS/MS) imagers.  It dynamically passes a variable narrow band spectral component (li) from the visible to xxxxxx (IR).  The filter has the following projected specifications: >95% in-band transmittance, 1,000 nm tuning range, a few to hundred nanometer variable bandwidth, 0.05 ms/nm tuning speed, large optical aperture size (10² ' 10² possible), and excellent environment stability against temperature fluctuation, mechanical impact and vibration. These performance characteristics, particularly the variable bandwidth, are not reachable for both commercial products on-the-shelf and state-of-the-art technologies. This filter is a vital enabling component for many photonics instruments such as multi- and hyper-spectral imaging system, Ladar/xxxxxx, mine detector, and optical beam steerer for tracking, ranging, measure and free-space optical communication. The xxxxxx I objective is to demonstrate the feasibility for the tunable filter while the xxxxxx objective is to optimize the filter through which prototype filter(s) will be developed.  The success of this project will open a new era for manufacturing tunable band-pass filters with the desired performance characteristics.	15062

Advanced Physical Models and Numerical Algorithms to Enable High-Fidelity Aerothermodynamic Simulations of Planetary Entry Vehicles on Emerging Distributed Heterogeneous Computing Architectures	2018-10-01	2018-07-19	The design and qualification of entry systems for planetary exploration largely rely on computational simulations. xxxxxxver, state-of-the-art modeling capabilities introduce substantial limitations in providing accurate and reliable predictions for aerothermodynamic flow environments of such entry, decent, and landing vehicles. These challenges are attributed to (i) the complexity of coupled multiphysical processes; (ii) limited experimental data for model validation; and (iii) the absence of advanced numerical algorithms and physical models for the accurate and efficient simulation of aerothermodynamic flows. By addressing these issues, the overall objective of this research is the development of advanced high-order numerical methods and high-fidelity physical models for the reliable prediction of aerothermodynamic flows that are relevant to hypersonic and atmospheric entry vehicles. Novel programming paradigms will be used for accelerating multiphysics simulation codes on emerging heterogeneous computing architectures. xxxxxxd, these modeling capabilities will provide improved predictions of heat-transfer, particle-laden reacting flows, and hypersonic environments to support the development of next-generation entry, descent, and landing systems.	15067

Current P-Band pulsed amplifier technologies use xxxxxx and LDMOS device technologies that have increased internal device parasitic characteristics that lead to lower gain and more difficult power matching over xxxxxx technologies.  xxxxxx Technologies has experience with all three device technologies.  xxxxxx also has the design and manufacturing processes in place to optimize transistor design and amplifier design for P-Band pulsed applications.   The preliminary effort will investigate xxxxxx devices at 150W (TBD) levels to determine the overall gain and efficiency at UHF frequencies using Class AB bias and Switch Mode matching techniques to achieve greater than 70% efficiency for a pulsed amplifier application.     xxxxxx term device investigation will include geometry modifications to optimize the chip size and cell dimensions for the P-Band RADAR application.   Ultimately, the xxxxxx device will be scaled into a target 1kxxxxxx output stage with an appropriate driver device to enable a greater than 40dB gain amplifier.  The final amplifier module will include bias modulation techniques for efficiency.  The amplifier will include material selections and layout techniques for reliability under high RF energy signal levels and low pressure environments.	15068

It will also provide a number of novel features such as (i) Profiler which replaces the need to create personalized websites, (ii) searching documents for query hits rather than the usual file name only, (iii) U-publish which enables \"publishing\" scientific papers and their supplementary materials, and EmailAttacher which works by dragging a file into an email utility but rather than attaching and sending the file, it simply creates a link to the folder where the file resides with the instructions for the user on the other end to retrieve it."	15069
High Reflectivity, Broad-Band Silver Coating, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	Future space telescopes such as the Super Nova Acceleration xxxxxx (SNAP) require exceptionally reflective coatings applied to mirrors several meters in diameter.  In 2007, xxxxxx xxxxxxics Corporation (SOC) applied a protected silver coating to the xxxxxx xxxxxx telescope's 1.4-m primary mirror.  xxxxxxhough SOC's coating design met the reflectance requirements for xxxxxx, the protective layers absorb too much energy in the UV and visible spectral regions to meet SNAP's science objectives.  In this research, SOC will improve the spectra performance of its current protected silver coating, by modifying the protection chemistry, as well as, the deposition process.  SOC's silver coating design is based on a protection recipe patented by xxxxxx (LLNL).  Recent SOC IRAD results showed that significant modifications to the basic LLNL protection scheme are possible, without sacrificing coating durability.In xxxxxx I, a variety of protective compounds will be fabricated by an ion-assisted evaporation process and optimized for their protective properties, adhesion characteristics, and effect on coating reflectivity.  In addition, SOC will create a more precise method to deposit protective NiCrNx atomic clusters, which are a critical element of LLNL's silver protection recipe.  By modifying SOC's evaporation system and monitoring process, it is expected the necessary volume of these highly absorbing clusters may be reduced by a factor of 2, while still providing adequate engineering margin to insure durability.  These modifications will significantly improve coating reflectance in the UV and visible spectral regions.

Single-Stage, Gelled Hydrazine System for Mars Ascent Vehicle Propulsion, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx, xxxxxx. in cooperation with xxxxxx is presenting an innovative approach to the xxxxxx Ascent Vehicle (MAV). The single-stage monopropellant system offers the substantial advantage of simplicity, while providing operational flexibility. The projected result offers low cost at high reliability. Our proposed concept employs a gelled hydrazine monopropellant which provides low temperature capability (-54 ?C/ 65 ?F demonstrated), thus reducing the thermal conditioning demand on the xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx (EDL). Precision pointing at the time of launch is not required due to the relatively low, under 10g's, initial acceleration and high control gain provided by the articulated plug nozzle, enabling the use of a single degree-of-freedom EDL launch platform.  This proposal combines the strength of a previous proposal submitted to xxxxxx xxxxxxs Division, in May of 2010, with the particular expertise of xxxxxx xxxxxx. in space mission design as well as its advanced all-composite pressurized structures technology for significant vehicle performance/weight reduction enhancements. The MAV concept and its CONOPS are built on experience by xxxxxx, xxxxxx and Avaliant and employ a single stage mono propellant design. The proposal takes advantage of the vast experience of the team members from programs such as VIKING, Sidewinder, and AMRAAM, missile guidance algorithm design, communications and health monitoring systems engineering. This single-stage, liquid monopropellant MAV concept leverages recent component advancements resulting from over $500 million in investment by the Missile Defense Agency in miniature interceptor component technology.	15072

Water Recovery for Regenerative Life Support Systems, Phase II	2016-01-01	2018-07-19	Thermal and environmental control systems for future exploration spacecraft must meet challenging requirements for efficient operation and conservation of resources.  Regenerative xxxxxx removal systems are attractive for these missions because they do not use consumable xxxxxx absorbers.  xxxxxxver, these systems also absorb and vent water to space along with the carbon dioxide.  We propose to develop an innovative water recovery system that minimizes water lost from regenerative xxxxxx control systems without the need for low-temperature condensing heat exchangers.  This approach addresses the need for water recovery systems in long-duration missions, reduces the need for consumables by enabling use of state-of-the-art regenerative xxxxxx removal systems, and minimizes demands on the spacecraft thermal control system.

Low Temperature Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Sterilization Shower	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	The goal is to develop an atmospheric plasma jet that is capable of depositing a wide variety of materials on flexible substrates such as paper, plastic, cotton and thin metal foils. This would be a dry alternative to inkjet printing.&nbsp; There has been an increased interest in fabricating electronic devices on flexible substrates with enhanced emphasis on recyclable materials. Atmospheric pressure plasma may be a low cost solution to provide 100% efficiency with respect to sterilization. It creates oxygen atoms, ions which are effective in sterilization in addition to the help from the UV of the plasma, ion bombardment and the mild heat the plasma produces.

GPS Attitude Determination for Launch Vehicles, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxxearch Corporation proposes to develop a family of compact, low-cost GPS-based attitude (GPS/A) sensors for launch vehicles. In order to obtain 3-D attitude measurements (roll, pitch, and yaw) conventional GPS/A systems require three or more antennas with relatively large baselines (~0.5 m). In sharp contrast, xxxxxx's GPS/A system can obtain 3-D attitude measurements with one or more single-aperture antennas. xxxxxx's GPS/A sensor is dubbed the Miniature xxxxxxted Direction-finding Attitude-determining Anti-jam xxxxxx (MIDAAS(TM)) and employs an innovative single-aperture antenna to compute full 3-D attitude using only two RF channels, leading to a smaller, simpler, lower-cost receiver system. A single (gyro-less) MIDAAS unit can be used to provide attitude information on very small launch platforms. In addition, multiple (gyro-less) MIDAAS units can be employed over larger baselines for increased attitude accuracy. A single (< 6.xxxxxx diameter) MIDAAS system also provides tactical-grade attitude performance when coupled with commercial-grade gyros at a significantly lower cost. Furthermore, MIDAAS provides active xxxxxxjam protection and multipath mitigation thereby improving the integrity and robustness of the navigation system.	15078

In addition, this RC-xxxxxxd approach can replace manual, ad-hoc development methods and support xxxxxxtime Reconfiguration (RTR) activities that allow the dynamic modification of the functional configuration of the RC hardware and adaptive computing.   Specifically, xxxxxx's approach offers reconfigurable software and firmware that provides access control, and reconfiguration process including partial reconfiguration.The WW xxxxxx Group (xxxxxx) presents a novel approach for reconfigurable, reprogrammable communication systems that provide high performance within the constraints of power consumption, reliability, size, and weight.  By combining the system on a chip (SoC) technologies in a distributed platform supported by a flexible software infrastructure, our system strikes the optimal balance between size, power consumption, and functionality.	15083
Conformal Space Suit Antenna Development for Enhanced EVA Communications and Wearable Computer Applications, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	As xxxxxx prepares for future space missions and the return to the moon by 2020, astronauts will be required to spend more time exposed to the hazards of performing xxxxxx (EVA).  Providing and maintaining reliable communications and overall information transfer is imperative during EVA operations not only to relay progress during the  task but also to monitor the health and ability of the astronaut to perform in hazardous environments.  Therefore, in order to improve astronaut mobility and primarily space to space communications, xxxxxxlied EM, xxxxxx. is proposing conformal, body-worn antennas that will be integrated into space suit designs to enhance EVA operations.  In addition, antenna designs for wireless RF telemetry will be developed to enable the use of wearable computers for astronaut space operations.  Recognizing the increased EVA operations anticipated for future missions, xxxxxx has been studying and testing new space suit designs in efforts to improve the astronaut's ability to move his or her body while wearing the space suit and to carry out EVA tasks as efficiently and safely as possible.

Hybrid Aerogel-MLI Insulation System for Cryogenic Storage in Space Applications, Phase II	2013-08-01	2018-07-19	The future of the xxxxxx space program includes longer and more invasive missions into space.  Long duration storage of large quantities of cryogenic fluids for propulsion, power, and life-support is an essential requirement for these missions.  Efficient and reliable insulation of the cryogenic fluids is key to the success of long missions into space.  xxxxxx successfully developed a novel low-density hybrid insulation system composed of multiple layers of low density, low dust superhydrophobic aerogels and multilayer insulation (MLI) for cryogenic fluid management.  The hybrid aerogel/MLI insulation system outperformed MLI system at cryogenic temperatures and across a range of vacuum conditions, including high vacuum.  This exceptional performance is considered a new breakthrough in high vacuum cryogenic thermal insulation materials.  During the xxxxxx Program, further refinement and qualification testing of the low-density aerogel material will be performed in order to be used in real world applications.  xxxxxx oxygen (LOX) compatibility of the aerogel material and a cost assessment will also be investigated.  For qualification of this novel insulation system for future xxxxxx in-space programs, extensive work will be dedicated to large-scale testing and performance evaluation of the refined hybrid aerogel/MLI insulation system.	15086
GaAs JFETs for Extremely Low-Noise, Deep Cryogenic Sensor Readout, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxsensitive sensors used in xxxxxxs scientific missions (for example infrared sensors) typically require operation at deep cryogenic temperatures for optimum performance. xxxxxxver, to make full use of their performance requires an ultralow-noise preamplifier co-located in the same, or a nearby, cryogenic environment at liquid-helium (~1-4 K) or sub-xxxxxx temperatures. A severe impediment to making such preamplifiers is the lack of a semiconductor device with satisfactorily performance in the liquid-helium range (or even below ~40 K). Past use of Si xxxxxxs (operating at ~80 K or higher) has required awkward work-arounds. More serious is that upcoming missions will employ ever more sophisticated and complex sensor systems. What served in the past will be inadequate. Specifically, Si-based technology will not be adequate for preamplifiers needed for advanced sensor systems in upcoming missions and could become the bottleneck in performance and scientific return. Consequently, we propose to develop xxxxxx xxxxxxs that can exhibit extremely low noise to the lowest cryogenic temperatures (4 K and lower). Our approach is to fabricate the xxxxxxs specifically for low-noise, deep cryogenic operation and to use a novel, proprietary design for the xxxxxx that avoids factors that contribute to noise generation in standard xxxxxx xxxxxxs.	15087

The bandwidth limitations of high-frequency circulators will be explored. It was demonstrated in the xxxxxx I work that the bandwidth of these components can be substantially increased through impedance matching techniques. At the end of the xxxxxx program, xxxxxx Harmonics will have developed a full line of isolators operating in bands from WR-12 through WR-3 and circulators working in bands from WR-15 through WR-5.

Electrical power systems constitute a critical division of the exploration systems in enabling reliable ground and settlement operations. Even with the added hardware redundancy in the design, early diagnostics at the component level and application of fault tolerant techniques at the system level are imperative in providing an integrated reliability solution. Moreover, the proposed technology is highly adaptable across many systems of the Constellation program, including the xxxxxxn crew exploration vehicle, xxxxxx, and the lunar surface vehicles. This effort proposes an ambitious plan to improve the state-of-the-art in power system and converter (silicon and wide band gap based) in built-in-test (BIT) capabilities, enhance reliability assessment, and minimize fault propagation. Impact is proposing to develop the power system BIT capabilities based on: 1) high frequency ringing characterization in power devices, 2) an L1 norm based algorithm to monitor power quality, primarily in the converter, and 3) a dynamic differential current sensor to predict component aging and failure. These BIT techniques will continuously provide system and component level health assessment, which will be fed into the \"Health Manager xxxxxx\" module to analyze the severity of fault and invoke the appropriate response to avoid system-wide failure propagation and enable reconfiguration techniques to promote mission completion. These techniques are mindful of the strict power, cost, size, and weight requirements for space exploration systems. They are designed to be embedded into the current configuration with minimal hardware and utilize unused processing resources."	15090
User Centric Data Acquisition and Delivery Sytems for Precision Ag, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	"The availability of remotely sensed data has been improving with each new high-resolution satellite obtaining operational capability in orbit. xxxxxxver, the ability of commercial and government entities to efficiently share or sell this  data has not kept pace. The proposed GeoSpatial data distribution system will exploit recent improvements in advanced computing environments and processing algorithms  to provide on demand products with a \"no minimum purchase\" requirement. The inability of data providers to efficiently create and disseminate small foot prints or even on-demand data products has been a limiting factor in expanding the use of remotely sensed data.  Creating a system that can efficiently distribute data or products in small foot prints will greatly improve the economic viability of the entire industry. Providing a customer initiated order system will make ordering up remotely sensed data as easy as creating a Web-based profile and interactively selecting and downloading the raw-data of choice or choosing and executing the real-time development of a data product. Pay by the square kilometer with no minimums. Use of the advanced functions provide unprecedented functionality to create a new, customer defined data product."	15091

CNT Applique for SHM of Space Structures, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx structures are unique in that once they are deployed, there is little to no opportunity for manual inspection to assess their integrity.  Even on the space station, where there is a continuous human presence, traditional non-destructive evaluation (NDE) is impractical due to complexity of necessitating a space-walk, not to mention the training required to obtain meaningful results. These structures are subject to damage caused by the extreme launch environment, micrometeorite and orbital debris (Mxxxxxx) impact, thermal cycling and even atomic-level corrosion.  Nevertheless, it is desirable for space structures to be designed with as small safety margins as possible due to the significant cost of placing objects into space.  Therefore, xxxxxx seeks reliable structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques to be able to remotely inspect space structures.  Such a system could be used as an early warning system for manned space missions, to indicate when a critical repair may need to be conducted, or an emergency abort event is necessitated.  MDC proposes the use of a conformal CNT applique for providing SHM capabilities to space structures while only adding 10 GSM mass and 100 micron thickness.  Four separate detection methods will be demonstrated using the multi-physics properties of this unique material.	15101

Cavity Enhanced Thomson Scattering Diagnostic for Electron Measurements in Weakly Ionized Discharges	2018-08-01	2018-07-19	The research plan for the present NSTRF proposal focuses on a new laser diagnostic for measurement of electrons (density and temperature) in electric propulsion (EP) devices. xxxxxxn measurements are critical, but conventional probe based measurements are challenging. The proposed method is based on a new version of laser xxxxxx scattering (LTS) that relies upon a high-power beam, generated in an optical build-up cavity, to increase the scattered photon counts and signal levels. The new approach is enabled by recent technological advances (narrow linewidth fiber lasers, commercial laser locking hardware, and dielectric super mirrors) that will allow a beam power as high as ~10-100 kW, which are several orders of magnitude greater than what is typically used. In this way, the detection limit will be lowered to ~10^10 cm^-3, which will open the door for measurements of electric propulsion devices, such as xxxxxx thrusters (which cannot be readily measured with existing LTS systems). The technique will have high spatial and temporal resolution such that dynamic processes, such as the 'breathing mode', can be studied.xxxxxx thrusters have been acknowledged by xxxxxx in the In-xxxxxx Propulsion xxxxxxs xxxxxx section 2.2.1.2.2 (xxxxxx thrusters) as a technology that will directly support current and future xxxxxx mission goals.  xxxxxxment of physics based models and a more fundamental understanding of the plasma dynamics inside the channel and exhaust plume of the thruster are required for progression of the technology.  The proposed research project directly supports this development by presenting a new non-intrusive highly sensitive diagnostic technique. As part of the fellowship, the technology will be transferred to a xxxxxx research facility and will represent a significant upgrade to current probe based diagnostic techniques. Additionally, development of this technique will be of benefit to the plasma research community, as it will also allow measurements in other weakly ionized plasmas (e.g. processing plasmas).	15105

Thesedetectors are based on the active regions with xxxxxx bulk alloy layerand a secondary xxxxxx bulk alloy layer, which serves as a sink for boththe dark and background currents. Room temperature or moderately cooledoperation of these detectors is achieved by suppressing the xxxxxx andradiative recombination mechanisms. We will also incorporate in eachpixel a dynamic skimming that will reduce the effect of dark andbackground currents while enhancing the dynamic range. Therefore, we aredesigning detectors that are read out integrated circuit (ROIC)friendly.

Computational Aeroacoustics Using the Generalized Lattice Boltzmann Equation, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	The overall objective of the proposed project is to develop a generalized lattice Boltzmann (GLB) approach as a potential computational aeroacoustics (CAA) tool for noise prediction thus contributing to xxxxxx goal of reducing noise levels of subsonic aircraft. xxxxxxtice Boltzmann equation (LBE) based simulations are attractive for CAA as they can handle very complex geometries and parallelize with excellent scalability. This enables efficient simulation of very large problems, such as airframe systems. The innovativeness of the proposed GLB method lies in employing multiple relaxation times to capture different hydrodynamic/acoustic modes accurately, in contrast to usual LBE solution methods using a single relaxation time for all modes. The GLB approach would enable higher fidelity CAA simulations as well as exhibit stability at higher xxxxxx numbers. xxxxxx relaxation times can also enable represent turbulence better for large eddy simulation. In phase I, the feasibility of the GLB method will be evaluated by coding a 3D solver, including a subgrid scale turbulence model and multiblock grid refinement algorithms, with testing against several CAA benchmark problems. If successful, a validated package based on the GLB method interfaced to xxxxxx pre/post processors, like CART3D, for complex geometries would be developed in xxxxxx.	15110
Bio-manufacturing for Space Applications	2019-09-01	2018-07-19	Long-duration human exploration and habitation on other planets such as xxxxxx will require not only bringing supplies, but also the ability to use local resources to manufacture needed mission products. In situ resource utilization and manufacturing can lead to substantial mass and volume savings, and increase mission self-sustainability. Example mission materials needed include food and nutrients, polymers (plastics), medicines, fuels, binders and various feedstock chemicals.The overarching goal of this project is&nbsp;to develop and demonstrate advanced biological systems that utilize local resources to manufacture high-value products on demand. In many cases, biological systems are either cheaper than competing physico-chemical systems or are the only known method of production. A major project task includes developing methods that efficiently and rapidly convert carbon dioxide and hydrogen to organic substrates that microbes can use to grow and make mission products. xxxxxx dioxide is the primary component of the xxxxxx atmosphere and is therefore an abundant source of carbon and oxygen. xxxxxx can also be obtained from locally-sourced water. Together, these molecules can form the basis for a wide array of products that support human missions.Another major goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to engineer microorganisms that produce human nutrients on-demand. Providing nutrition on long-duration missions via stored dehydrated food or by growing plants may lead to deficiencies in certain vitamins/nutrients. We are therefore demonstrating the capability to rapidly generate a specific carotenoid (an xxxxxxoxidant) using an engineered yeast grown on an edible dehydrated media. This includes an initial demonstration on xxxxxx over the course of several years to investigate long-duration storage of the microbes and media, and the ability to produce a nutrient of consistent quality and quantity.These efforts seek to leverage the rapidly increasing capabilities being developed in the private sector, academia, and xxxxxxoratories regarding genetic engineering, bioinformatics, advanced manufacturing and processing, and chemical engineering techniques. Together, with intentional collaboration, these research areas will spur novel technologies that facilitate microbial bio-manufacturing in space and on Earth.	15111

Development of Corrosion-Resistant Molecular Sieve Inclusion Nanocomposite (MoSIN) Membranes to Recover Water from Urine through Osmotic Processes	2016-10-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxxional Aeronautic and xxxxxx Administration (xxxxxx) seeks to dramatically improve state-of-the art systems for water recovery and management for human health and habitation in space flight and travel. In particular, a long-term goal is to increase water recovery from wastewaters to create a closed-loop water recycling system. Currently, in the Water Recovery xxxxxx (WRS) used on xxxxxx (xxxxxx) only 70% of the wastewater generated is recovered; the remaining 30% of the water is brine that is stored for later disposal. Under this system, wastewater recycling is dependent on resupply of water from the ground to the xxxxxx. Since xxxxxx has retired the space shuttle fleet, the need to minimize use of ground-based resources is a higher priority. As a result, xxxxxx faces the challenge of either developing new wastewater recycling systems or optimizing existing ones to maximize water recovery. Current osmotic processes – both reverse osmosis (RO) and forward osmosis (FO) – offer the potential to increase water recovery from wastewaters consisting of raw urine, pre-treated urine, and urine brines. xxxxxxver, commercial RO and FO membranes rapidly degrade in the presence of the acidic pre-treated urine and urine brines. Additionally, these commercial RO and FO membranes are flawed in that they are not a sufficient barrier to small organic compounds commonly found in urine, such as urea. In this research project, our lab at xxxxxx State xxxxxxersity will develop a new class of corrosion-resistant Molecular Sieve xxxxxxlusion xxxxxxcomposite (MoSIN) membranes and we will demonstrate their effectiveness for recovering water from urine and urine brine solutions through osmotic processes.	15113

This instrument measures the intensities of in-situ charged particles ( >13 keV electrons and >24 keV ions) with various levels of discrimination based on energy range and mass species. A subset of almost 100 LECP channels are included in this data set. The LECP data are globally calibrated to the extent possible.  xxxxxx include electrons, protons, alpha particles, and light, medium, and heavy nuclei particles.  The far encounter data are 48.0 second rate and flux measurements within 1/8 of the LECP instrumental motor rotation period (the angular scanning periods, or step period).	15114
Unconditionally Stable Low Dropout Regulators for Extreme Environments, Phase II	2014-03-01	2018-07-19	We have developed a low dropout (LDO) regulator using a patented MESFET transistor technology that can be manufactured in commercial CMOS foundries with no changes to the process flow. The regulator is stable under all load conditions without an external compensation capacitor, thereby reducing the mass/volume of the power management system and increasing reliability. The MESFET-based LDO component has very competitive figures of merit (dropout voltage, transient response, power supply rejection) compared to existing components. During xxxxxx we confirmed that the components were unconditionally stable without an external compensation capacitor over the temperature range -196C to +150C and for radiation doses up to 1 Mrad(Si). We shall build on the xxxxxx design effort to demonstrate two fully integrated LDO regulators rated up to 1A with dropout voltages of less than 50 mV. One part will be fabricated using a qualified rad-hard SOI CMOS foundry in collaboration with Honeywell, one of our commercialization partners. The other component will be fabricated using the low-cost/high-volume foundry available from IBM. Both parts will have a nominal output voltage of 1.8V with 1% accuracy. Other designs will target user adjustable voltages in the range 1.2-2V. The feasibility of using the MESFET technology for low voltage applications (e.g. 0.8V) will be explored. All parts will be tested over the temperature range -150C to +150C and after irradiation exposure to a TID of 1 Mrad from a Co-60 source. The enhanced low dose rate sensitivity (ELDRS) of the components will be studied using a low dose rate Cs-137 source. The characteristics of all the components will be documented, and parts made available to xxxxxx and potential customers as deliverables from the xxxxxx 2 activity. We shall work with our commercialization partners to have the LDO regulator design adopted as a licensed 'IP block' and to develop low cost versions for the wider consumer electronics market.	15115
Global Optimization of Interplanetary Missions with, Hybrid Propulsion, Multi-Stage Spacecraft, Aerocapture, and Planetary Atmospheric Probes	2017-09-01	2018-07-19	The purpose of this IRAD is to expand the capability of xxxxxx&rsquo;s interplanetary trajectory preliminary design tool, the Evolutionary Mission xxxxxx (EMTG), to new classes of missions that use &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; propulsion with both low-thrust electric and high-thrust chemical propulsion systems. Such missions may also include multi-stage spacecraft and require the mission analyst to choose when to drop propulsion stages, and in some cases may employ aerocapture to reduce the required propellant mass. In parallel with these new modeling capabilities, we also propose to improve the efficiency and robustness of EMTG&rsquo;s multi-objective trade study optimizer.This IRAD is specifically targeted to address the elements of EMTG that are inadequate to the design of missions to the outer solar system. EMTG is exceptionally capable of designing missions to planets and small bodies in the inner solar system, up to about 3 AU from the sun. xxxxxxver, as the PI and co-PIs have learned in the last year in which we have been working on xxxxxx proposals, there are several modeling and optimization capabilities that are critical to the design of outer-solar system missions that EMTG does not effectively handle. The purpose of this IRAD is to take advantage of the lessons that we have recently learned, and perform a much more efficient and exhaustive trade of mission design options for the next opportunity, which is expected to be a little over a year away.This IRAD is divided into three independent tasks. Each provides a critical outer-planets capability to EMTG but each also has separate staffing and budget requirements.Task #1 is to provide EMTG with the ability to model and optimize missions that employ hybrid-propulsion and/or multi-stage spacecraft. A &ldquo;hybrid-propulsion&rdquo; spacecraft is one that uses both low-thrust electric propulsion and high-thrust chemical propulsion at different times during the mission. A &ldquo;multi-stage&rdquo; spacecraft is one that drops empty tanks, expended thrusters, or other hardware at some point during the mission.&nbsp; Hybrid-propulsion spacecraft going to the outer solar system are likely to also be multi-stage because a large electric propulsion system is only likely to be useful during the part of the mission where the spacecraft is still near the sun and solar power is plentiful. It is possible to, at great cost, assemble a solution by hand but this is time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, it is possible that high-performing solutions were not identified. In Task #1, EMTG will not only be upgraded to properly model hybrid-propulsion and multi-stage vehicles but its optimization engine will be given the ability to choose (A) the number of stages and propulsion systems, (B) when the spacecraft should switch from one type of propulsion to another, and (C) when stages should be dropped. This will allow us to automate a process that is either very slow or impossible to do by hand. In turn, this could save a great deal of time and money in next mission design cycle. Moreover, the enhancements will allow for the potential to identify non-intuitive, enabling designs that would not have otherwise been uncovered because of the nature of the global, unbiased of the optimization algorithm.Task #2 is to improve the efficiency and capability of EMTG&rsquo;s multi-objective trade study optimizer. EMTG currently has the ability to optimally trade mission characteristics such as flight time and target selection against systems parameters such as mass, power, and launch vehicle. xxxxxxver this trade study tool has a major limitation. In the current optimizer architecture, every trade study objective has to be minimized or maximized. This works very well for most trade study objectives &ndash; for example one always wants to deliver as much mass as possible and to make flight time, power system size, and propulsion system size as small as possible. xxxxxxver, other trade study parameters, such as launch and arrival date, are frequently desired as an even spread in order to fully and properly understand the trade space. We did not accommodate this critical functionality in the first version of the trade study tool and modifying it will require a significant effort. The ability to generate these new types of trade curves (e.g., delivered payload mass versus launch date with multiple objectives) will allow deeper insight into the solution space, and enable proper evaluation of the fittest design for the mission at hand.&nbsp; Such trade curves have been needed multiple times for multiple missions. Furthermore we will need to expand the space of systems design choices that the trade study optimizer can make. Currently there is a wide range of options but they are hard-coded. Part of Task #2 will be to make it possible for EMTG to read the parameters of the various systems choices from a text file rather than requiring that they be hard-coded.In addition, the multi-objective trade study optimizer will need to become faster and more efficient in order to handle the large trade study problems that we are now required to solve. The first version of the trade study optimizer is based on the Nondominated xxxxxx xxxxxxtic xxxxxx (NSGA-II) that was the state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithm (MOGA) several years ago when we first began this work. xxxxxxver there are now other MOGAs available that are shown in the literature to perform better on many classes of problem. Part of Task #2 is to implement the newer algorithms in EMTG to improve speed and robustness.Task #3 is specifically targeted to improve EMTG&rsquo;s ability to design missions to gas giants and their moons. Many such missions either employ aerocapture to reduce the propellant cost of capture at the target or require dropping a probe into the atmosphere of a planet or moon. In both cases the spacecraft or probe dives into the atmosphere of the body and uses drag to slow itself down instead of expending propellant. Atmospheric probes are of great science interest, and aerocapture is an enabling technology for missions to xxxxxx and xxxxxx and to moons with thick atmospheres such as xxxxxx. xxxxxxver both atmospheric probes and orbiters that employ aerocapture must carry a thermal protection system (TPS) that can be quite massive. Any trajectory and systems analysis of missions that employ aerocapture and/or an atmospheric probe must include a means to estimate the mass of the thermal protection system as a function of the incoming trajectory and spacecraft specifications. There are currently no tools in the industry that can efficiently and autonomously perform this type of coupled analysis. As a hybrid trajectory and systems optimizer, EMTG is the ideal tool in which to add this capability.The key work in Task #3 will be to develop simplified aerocapture and atmospheric probe models that can be evaluated very quickly and robustly in the context of an optimization run. The proposed approach is to create, using existing tools, a series of high-fidelity point designs for a combination of various parameters. The data can then be fitted to curves, relating entry velocity, entry mass, and required TPS mass. Analytical expressions for the first derivatives of these curve fits can then be obtained for use EMTG&rsquo;s gradient-based optimizer.	15116

Numerical and Physical Modeling of the Response of Resonator Liners to Intense Sound and High Speed Grazing Flow, Phase II	2012-01-01	2018-07-19	An aeroacoustic computational code based upon a numerical solution of the full xxxxxx equations will be developed to provide a deep understanding of the physical behavior of resonator liners exposed to intense sound and boundary-layer grazing flow.  The code computes the entire flow and acoustic field inside the flow duct.  The user has the option to choose the flow xxxxxx number, boundary-layer thickness, duct mode of incoming sound, frequency and SPL.  For broadband sound, the user has the option to specify an incident noise spectrum.  The code is designed to operate at both standard temperatures and very high temperatures.A semi-empirical three-dimensional resonator liner impedance code will developed for resonators also exposed to intense sound and boundary-layer grazing flow.  The liner empirical parameters will be calibrated with xxxxxx furnished resonator test data.  Because of its simplicity, it can be used to provide realistic liner geometries for sound propagation codes that are used in both xxxxxx and industry to determine optimum wall impedances to control excessive sound generated in jet engines and other flow duct environments.	15119
Use Of Dynamic Distortion To Predict And Alleviate Loss Of Control, Phase II	2006-11-01	2018-07-19	"The intent of this project is to develop and validate means to alert, constrain and thereby alleviate loss of control (LOC) associated with unfavorable pilot-vehicle systems (PVS) interactions present in high gain, closed-loop PVS operations.  While the effective aircraft dynamic properties involved in these events have been extensively studied and understood, similar scrutiny has not been paid to the many aspects of the primary manual control system that converts the pilot control inputs to motions of the control surfaces.  It has often been tacitly assumed that the adoption of fly-by-wire (FBW) systems has eliminated the primary manual control link as an important player in LOC situations. Consequently, the impact of static and dynamic control system effects that distort \"ideal\" pilot to surface relationships, the near absence of manipulator tactile cues for some FBW systems, as well as the total elimination in FBW systems of some favorable cues present in traditional hydro-mechanical systems have not received detailed attention.  The purpose of the Smart-Cue developments proposed herein are to redress this neglect, to develop and, ultimately, to validate remedial manual control systems."	15120
Ultra-Low-Power MEMS Selective Gas Sensors, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	"KWJ offers this proposal for a very low power but very practical \"nano-watt\" MEMS sensor platform for xxxxxx requirements. The proposed nano-sensor platform is ultra low power and has a long sensor lifetime for extended battery life or power-harvester operation. The extremely fast response time of the sensor (<100 nsec) will be utilized in this xxxxxx as a possible new and innovative avenue to create selectivity for TCDs. This approach would only be available to very fast detectors like the new KWJ MEMS detector. The sensor is a platform technology designed for multiple analyte measurement on a single chip.  In addition to cryogenic system leak detection for xxxxxx, H2, and He, the platform can address trace levels of N2, O2, and H20 in gaseous helium purge streams. The xxxxxx project creates products and spin offs for xxxxxx, industrial, and medical applications."	15121
Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of Adult Medaka Tissues Sampled after Adaptation to a Space Environment	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	To understand how humans adapt to space environments many experiments can be conducted on astronauts while they work aboard xxxxxx or xxxxxx (xxxxxx). We also need animal experiments that can apply to human models and help prevent or solve the physical issues we face in space travel. The medaka is a suitable model fish for studying space adaptation because in the second International xxxxxx xxxxxx mission in 1994 adult fish mated successfully in space during 15 days of flight. In 2012 another space experiment   xxxxxx   was performed. xxxxxxe and female fish (6 weeks old at launching) were maintained in the xxxxxxtic xxxxxx system for 2 months in the ISxxxxxx xxxxxx-seq analysis of tissues from these fish will revealed tissue-specific responsiveness and common stress responses during space adaptation.	15122
Low-Power Radio and Image-Sensor Package, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	One of the most effective sensor modalities for situational awareness is imagery. While typically high bandwidth and relegated to analog wireless communications, continuing advances in consumer IC development hold the promise to revolutionize image data collection and its transport. In this effort, xxxxxx proposes to develop a high performance wireless video node that offers not only ultra low cost and power consumption but is also particularly well suited to xxxxxx mission needs. Our solution includes the use of not only advanced ICs, but also custom wireless communication protocols that enable transport of high frame-rate video over bandwidth-constrained links. In particular, xxxxxx will leverage CMOS sensor, H.264, and UHF transceiver ICs along with an Arm7-based MCU, which includes a variety of open-standard data connectivity options. As such, our solution is both highly-integrated and offers well-defined data interfaces in order to speed integration into flight systems. xxxxxx will leverage a proven novel medium access control (MAC) layer that employs dynamic channel allocation (DCA). We will provide ah hoc connectivity along with multi-hop capability through a source-driven network layer.	15123
Integrated System Health Management for Flexible Exploration, Phase I	2012-08-01	2018-07-19	Long-duration robotic and manned space missions have a number of unique requirements for mission success.  These include ultra-high reliability, safety, sustainability and affordability of launch vehicles and spacecraft.  These requirements, in turn, are allocated among critical subsystems, such as engines, propellants, structures, software systems, thermal protection, power, avionics, life support, guidance, communication and navigation.  In this vein, novel integrated system health management (ISHM) technologies that evolve with the system life-cycle, viz., concept-> design-> development-> production-> operations and training, are essential for meeting the requirements of safe and ultra-reliable, sustainable and affordable launch vehicles and spacecraft.   xxxxxx has been employing a number of reliability tools and methods, FMECA, FTA and PRA, for designing reliable and safe systems. xxxxxxver, the current methods are ad hoc, prone to errors and do not evolve with the system life-cycle.  In response to these challenges, Qualtech xxxxxxs, xxxxxx. (QSI) propose to develop an integrated system health management (ISHM) tool and a concomitant process for new heavy lift launch systems and exploration precursor robotic missions. The new risk and design analysis tool, when coupled with QSI's diagnostic and prognostic tools (QSI's Testability xxxxxxing and xxxxxx xxxxxx (TEAMS) toolset) will simplify early-stage design of health management functionality during the development of space systems (e.g., safety and mission assurance analysis, failure modes, effects and criticality analysis, hazards analysis, functional models, fault propagation models, testability analysis, design for serviceability, sustainability and affordability). The TEAMS SW suite already hosts a number of these desired capabilities. Consequently, QSI proposes to introduce additional modeling and analytic capabilities to TEAMS and enhance the existing, so as to make it an enhanced support tool for ISHM.	15124
Photonic Sensor for Nondestructive Testing of Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	Los Gatos xxxxxxearch proposes to develop a photonic sensorinstrumentation, capable of monitoring  distributed  load and acousticemission (AE) for rapid inspection of damages in composite overwrappedpressure vessels (COPV). Our novel sensor technology offers a number ofadvantages including sensor compactness and lightweight withmultiplexing capability for load and AE for monitoring andcharacterizing damages in advanced composite structures and components.We achieve this by employing xxxxxx grating sensor arrays and using anovel interrogation technique combined with state-of-the-art AE methodto detect and pinpoint composite defects in these structures.  In xxxxxx, we will demonstrate the sensor's capability to measure loads andacoustic emission in a composite structure in comparison withconventional piezoelectric type AE sensors. In addition, we will developa damage grading methodology to predict the presence, location, severityof damages in the COPV.  In xxxxxx, the grating sensors, interrogationsystem, and diagnostic software will be integrated into an automatedsystem, capable of measuring and correlating the load history, acousticemission activity, and determining the severity of damages and theirlocation in the COPV.	15125

Advanced In-Space Propulsion (AISP): Micro Electrospray Propulsion (MEP)	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	"Propulsion technology is often critical for space missions. High-value missions could be done with very small spacecraft, even xxxxxx, but these nanosatellites currently have little propulsion capability. After xxxxxx are deployed, they usually just tumble or drift away from the transport spacecraft. They cannot transfer to higher value orbits, maintain their orbit, or even deorbit. xxxxxx spacecraft would benefit from highprecision attitude-control systems to maintain the desired orbit and point in the desired direction. Existing attitude-control systems, like reaction wheels, are very complex and may have insufficient lifetimes. xxxxxx is investing in xxxxxxfluidic xxxxxxspray Propulsion (MEP) thrusters to provide the new propulsion capabilities to address both of these mission needs. Chemical propulsion systems are limited to the combustion energy available in the chemical bonds of the fuel and the acceleration provided by a converging-diverging nozzle. Electric propulsion uses electric power to accelerate propellant to very high exhaust velocities—up to 10 times greater than for chemical propulsion. This increases the momentum transfer efficiency or the fuel economy. The propellant efficiency of thrusters, which is proportional to the exhaust velocity, is referred to as the \"specific impulse,\" or ISP, measured in seconds. The state of the art for xxxxxx is cold gas propulsion with an ISP of 50 to 80 s. The chemical propulsion main engine for the space shuttles demonstrated an ISP of 450 s. xxxxxxver, the target ISP for MEP systems is greater than 1500 s—enough to transfer a 1-kg 10-cm cube from low Earth orbit to interplanetary space with only 200 g of propellant."	15127
SAL and PVS Model of TTEthernet Synchronization Protocol	2012-06-11	2018-07-19	Timed-xxxxxxed Ethernet (or TTEthernet)is a communication infrastructure that enables the use of Ethernet in real-time, distributed systems. TTEthernet is compatible with traditional IEEE 802.3 switched Ethernet standards, and is designed to support dataflows of mixed criticality on a single network. For traffic of the highest criticality, TTEthernet provides a timed-triggered communication service that relies on a fault-tolerant clock-synchronization protocol.We have developed formal models of parts of the TTEthernet protocols and analyzed safety-critical properties using both xxxxxx and PVS. Related work by xxxxxx is described in the xxxxxx xxxxxx.	15128

The phase change membranes could be used to passively and selectively mobilize water in microgravity to recover more water from urine and brine for environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS). A system using such technology might also be able to deliver water to plants in low gravity. This project will explore a recent advancement in xxxxxx xxxxxxe Permeation™ technology to enable improved (1) water recovery from urine/brine for Environmental Control and Life Support xxxxxxs, and (2) water delivery to plants for potential use in microgravity. The innovation is the use of a phase change permeation membrane to passively and selectively mobilize water in microgravity. Test objectives for water purification will determine the effects of temperature and waste water chemical composition on the water flux rate across the membrane and the chemical and microbiological water quality of permeate and effluent streams. Test objectives for water delivery to plants will determine the soil wetting characteristics of the Dutyion™ membrane material in normal gravity in preparation for future proposed flight testing.  	15129

Low-Cost Innovative Hi-Temp Fiber Coating Process for Advanced Ceramic Matrix Composites, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	MATECH GSM (MG) proposes 1) to demonstrate a low-cost innovative xxxxxx-doped in-situ BN fiber coating process for advanced ceramic matrixcomposites in order to eliminate performance barriers that preventpractical use of advanced future xxxxxx aircraft by performing interfacialcoating on single fiber tows and fiber preforms that are applicable tothe shape and structural requirements of advanced xxxxxx/xxxxxx super- andhyper-sonic components, and 2) to examine and model environmentaldurability of the fiber coating constituent in various hot-section CMCcomponents.  The CVI coating process is costly and yields a porousnon-uniform BN structure due to the low temperatures needed fordiffusion and infiltration of the gaseous precursors. MG has discovereda faster, more economical and more versatile process for fiber interfacecoating formation, reactive-transformation-process (RTP), where theinterface coating is formed from the ceramic fiber itself, a newinnovative in-situ Si-doped BN-based fiber coating that is more stableduring fabrication and service of Si-based CMC. The formation of anin-situ BN surface layer creates a more environmentally durable fibersurface not only because a more oxidation-resistant BN is formed, butalso because this layer provides a physical barrier between contactingall single fibers with oxidation-prone xxxxxx surface layers.	15131

On-Chip hyperspetral imaging system for portable IR spectroscopy applications, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	Hyperspectral middlewave infrared and longwave infrared (MWIR/xxxxxx) imaging systems capable of obtaining hundreds of narrow band (10-15 nm) spectral information of Earth's surface, the atmosphere, and land use in agriculture are of great importance in xxxxxx Earth remote sensing missions. Existing hyperspectral MWIR/xxxxxx imaging systems are bulky and heavy and thus not suitable for portable and small satellite applications. This xxxxxx project aims to develop an on-chip hyerspectral imaging system with integrated narrow-band (15 nm) hyperspectral filers on the pixels of the MWIR/xxxxxx image array.

Material response reconstruction of ablative TPS using accurate boundary layer modeling	2019-01-01	2018-07-19	For hypersonic atmospheric entry missions, charring ablators are often used. These materials are made of non-pyrolyzing matrices (carbon, ceramic, etc.) combined with pyrolyzing materials (phenolic, silicon resin). Pyrolysis is the process in which the polymer gradually carbonizes at high temperature, losing mass and generating pyrolysis gas. Once generated inside the matrix, the gas is expelled at the surface, changing the chemical composition of the boundary layer and influencing the thermal conductivity.The material models currently used for designing AVCOAT thermal protection systems (TPS) are based on models that were designed during the xxxxxx era. xxxxxxhough they have been updated to better replicate the behavior of modern-day AVCOAT, such as that used on xxxxxxn, they remain very similar to the original. xxxxxxhough these models have been adequate in providing analyses leading to successful missions, they  fail to account for specific physical processes; the results therefore lack accuracy, leading to higher safety margins for TPS.. The current proposal aims at using a statistical approach to redesign, from the ground up, the AVCOAT material model currently used by xxxxxx. Using uncertainty analysis, the extensive AVCOAT arc-jet data will be thoroughly analyzed, and used to estimate the best simulation parameters. This new material model will then be applied to the EFT-1 flight data, and its accuracy will be assessed. As a second task, a new integrated modeling approach will be developed and tested.  Contrary to the state-of-the-art  which consist of coupling (loosely or not) a CFD code to a Material xxxxxx  (MR) code, the new method proposes to solve the whole domain using one general set of equations for both the flow field and the porous ablator. This approach has the advantage of effectively removing all boundary layer assumption currently used in aerothermal boundary conditions by letting the code calculate the surface fluxes intrinsically, and not by imposing approximate surface balance equations.	15139

High Efficiency Advanced Lightweight Fuel Cell (HEAL-FC), Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	Infinity's xxxxxx xxxxxxanced xxxxxxweight Fuel Cell (HEAL FC) is an improved version of its current fuel cell technology developed for space applications. The fundamental operation of this xxxxxx Exchange xxxxxx (PEM) fuel cell is improved over comparable fuel cell technologies, providing simplified system design and longer duration missions. The Non Flow Through (NFT) nature of reactant consumption within the fuel cell stack produces a much higher utilization of reactants. The xxxxxxanced Product Water Removal (APWR) embodied within each repeat element of the fuel cell stack allows for the elimination of the water separation devices usually residing in the balance of system. This drives system simplification while increasing overall reliability and reducing system cost. The HEAL FC can be operated as a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell for long endurance missions and also as a hydrogen-air fuel cell. This transition from pure oxygen to air can be accomplished dynamically in flight, allowing for reduced mass of the oxygen storage subsystem. This is a critical advantage for UAS flying to and from dense air environments consuming air as the fuel cell oxidant and switching over to pure oxygen when in the dense air region of concern. The fuel cell stack improvements to be made as part of this topic are planned to make the fuel cell stack more amenable to xxxxxx Aerial xxxxxxs (UAS) by reducing mass and volume. The current configuration of the fuel cell stack was driven by performance only. Now that the NFT and APWR technologies have been proven, the stack hardware itself must be minimized to fit the UAS markets. Costs for this advanced fuel cell system will inherently be reduced through the implementation of mass production design methodology to transform a well-functioning power system for space applications to lower altitude uses.	15143

Fault Tolerant, Radiation hard DSP, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	"Commercial digital signal processors (DSP) are problematic for satellite computers due to damaging space radiation effects, particularly single event upsets (SEU) and functional interrupts (SEFI).  xxxxxx has developed innovations for mitigating SEU and SEFI errors, enabling the use of very high-speed commercial DSPs with improved SEU tolerances (>1E-4 unrecoverable errors/day).  Time-Triple xxxxxx Redundancy (TTMR) is a method of applying traditional triple modular redundancy on a single processor, exploiting the VLIW class of parallel processors.  SEFI is solved by a Hardened xxxxxx circuit, external to the microprocessor, which monitors the \"health\" of the processor, and when SEFI occurs, forces the processor to return to performance through a series of escalating events (interrupts, reset, etc).In xxxxxx I we apply these technologies to COTS DSPs and also will extend the TTMR and Hardened xxxxxx architecture to reconfigurable FPGA arrays, with dramatically improved SEU/SEFI rates for xxxxxx FPGAs.In xxxxxx we will provide SEU & SEFI hardened DSP plus FPGA product, with performance of 8,000 MIPS fixed point and 1.8 GFLOPS floating point (derated approximately 50% for improved SEU performance) while consuming less than 2 watts power, combined with an array of xxxxxx reconfigurable FPGAs, providing approximately 7500 MFLOPS per FPGA."	15149

Carbon Foam Self-Heated Tooling for Out-of-Autoclave Composites Manufacturing, Phase II	2012-04-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxxoratory, Ltd. (xxxxxx) has developed a novel and innovative Out-of-Autoclave (OOA) composites manufacturing process with an electrically heated carbon foam tooling system. Electrically Heated Tooling (EHT) utilizes a coal-based carbon foam (CFOAMREG) core that serves as both the tool substrate and the heating source for a composite part being cured. The tool heating is a result of flowing current through the carbon foam, which results in heating.  This approach to self-heated tooling is a potentially enabling technology for manufacturing large composite structures by eliminating the need for autoclaves and large curing ovens, as well as by reducing costs, weight, and improving composite part quality.The overall objective of the xxxxxx xxxxxx 2 program will be to optimize critical factors for thermal uniformity in a CFOAM Electrically Heated Tool (EHT) and to validate the electrically heated cure process with current state-of-the-art OOA materials.  The data generated will be used to produce a Scaled Composite Shroud (SCS) cylindrical mandrel EHT that will be designed, fabricated, tested, and used to cure a large composite part without an autoclave or oven.  The SCS demonstration tool will be up to an 8' diameter and 12' length mandrel, which will be approximately one-forth of the scale as a tool necessary for an ARES V composite structure.	15154

Tunable, Resettable, Printable, Impact Energy Absorbing Matrix	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxding on a largely unknown planetary surface imposes risks to the structure of the lander. This effort seeks to reduce the risk of energy absorption in two ways. Primarily it provides a method of fully characterizing an energy absorbing material through analysis verified by testing. xxxxxxondly, since energy absorbing elements will likely need to be constrained geometrically (such as within a cartridge enclosure), this effort would provide the basis for a CAD model that could easily be changed late in the design process without having to change the supporting structure. The ability to custom 3D print energy absorbing materials/substructure would greatly support flexibility in future lander designs. This effort will begin with 2D and 3D printed plastic prototypes, followed by development of a 3D printed titanium prototype. Test results for the titanium prototypes are due by the end of the FY.	15161

Automated Real-Time Clearance Analyzer (ARCA), Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	The Automated Real-Time Clearance Analyzer (xxxxxx) addresses the future safety need for Real-Time xxxxxx-Wide Safety Assurance (RSSA) in aviation and progressively more trusted autonomy as will be explored in xxxxxx SMART-NAS and SASO within the Airspace Operations and Safety Program (xxxxxx). xxxxxx builds on recent advances in probabilistic (xxxxxxian) network modeling and the rapid expansion of big data capabilities. The application of xxxxxx that we propose to develop, xxxxxx-A, performs safety analyses of approach clearances based on multiple sources of relevant real-time data, such as real-time aircraft data, weather data, past and current operations data, and crew data. xxxxxx-A provides intelligent risk assessment of clearances over the lifetime of the operation, from planning to clearance delivery. As it matures, xxxxxx can play a range of roles at increasing levels of autonomy and authority. Initially, once it has trained to the level of generating insight, it can be used to identify hot spots in the NAS or in a region (specific areas, procedures, aircraft types, or times of day when risks increase) on a daily or weekly review basis. Next, it could be deployed to air traffic managers, dispatchers, or other users with real-time operational oversight. With further integration, it could optionally display real-time informational warnings on ATC displays, flight displays, or dispatcher screens.

IntraVenous Fluid GENeration for Exploration Missions (IVGEN)	2011-08-01	2018-07-19	During the past year, electronic data was analyzed. A plan was developed and implemented to ascertain the cause for not meeting the USP target for acceptable saline concentration in the two samples that were produced. For the first case, the cause was attributed to the introduction of a larger than acceptable air bubble into the liquid feed. For the second case, the cause was that an insufficient amount of salt was premeasured into the mixing bags. A final report was generated--see xxxxxx section.	15174

The system has three unique features: (1) the methane pyrolysis reactor that does not rely on high single-pass efficiencies (which will make the system robust), (2) it incorporates batch processing modes, cleaning cycles, and a carbon capture device (which makes it reusable), and (3) it uses palladium membrane technology to separate the hydrogen from the methane stream (which makes the H2 effluent very pure).

Dual-mode Propulsion System Enabling CubeSat Exploration of the Solar System	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxearchers at the Center for xxxxxx Nuclear xxxxxxearch (CSNR) are proposing a radioisotope-based, dual-mode, low mass propulsion system for a CubeSat payload capable of extending their exploration realm out of LEO. Such an integrated propulsion system would allow for beneficial exploration to be conducted, even within the current budget limitations. With the cost of planetary exploration rising and budgets for such missions declining newer, cheaper, i.e. low mass, systems must be developed to perform exploration. Currently, small scientific beds which perform limited tasks are being developed and launched into xxxxxx (LEO) in the form of small-scale satellite units, i.e. xxxxxx, utilizing solar-based power. xxxxxxver, if a reasonable propulsion system could be developed, these low cost CubeSat platforms could be used to perform exploration of various extra-terrestrial bodies within the solar system; such as xxxxxx. Current standard propulsion technology does not provide the complete answer. Chemical-based systems are high mass and provide insufficient performance for deep space missions. Electric propulsion (EP) is very efficient, i.e. high xxxxxx, but has low thrust, leading to long mission times if orbital maneuvering is required. Thermal propulsion (TP) yields high thrust, but at the expense of a high consumption rate of propellant. Therefore, pairing an EP and TP system into a dual-mode propulsion unit becomes beneficial, where the strengths of each system are used appropriately. The high thrusting capabilities of the thermal mode are ideal for quick Earth orbit escape, drastic orbital maneuvering and orbital insertion at location. The high efficiency of the electric-mode is ideal for interplanetary travel. xxxxxxearchers at the Center for xxxxxx Nuclear xxxxxxearch (CSNR) are proposing a radioisotope-based, dual-mode, low mass propulsion system for a CubeSat payload capable of extending their exploration realm out of LEO. Such an integrated propulsion system would allow for beneficial exploration to be conducted, even within the current budget limitations.For the proposed work a complete system design will be provided, optimized&nbsp;for a xxxxxx destination with a 10 kg payload. xxxxxx software such as AGI STK, COMSOL, MALTO and Aspen will be used to&nbsp;design and optimize the various components of the overall system. The design of an experiment will also be conducted to use existing&nbsp;CSNR hardware to evaluate propellant performance within the thermal mode.	15182

Low Power Broadband Low-Noise Amplifiers from 1-300GHz	2012-09-01	2018-07-19	A few key technology areas are moving to the use of cryogenic detectors and require state-of-the-art cryogenic amplifiers. For example, nanowire sensors for optical communication ground stations achieve 30 psec timing resolution not available in other detector technologies. Focal planes for astrophysics are driving toward megapixel arrays to do both spectroscopy and multi-object observations of targets at high Z. These applications require a back-end amplifier with high bandwidth (1-10GHz).A number of low noise amplifier technologies exist at a variety of maturity levels and with a variety of strengths and limitations. The most mature amplifier technologies are semiconducting amplifier (InP HEMT or SiGe). The InP HEMTS have the lowest noise above several GHz, and are available commercially. xxxxxxver, more advanced InP HEMT ICs are only available to those with specialized knowledge and contacts with industry. By contrast the SiGe circuits have lower noise below two GHz and can be manufactured as complex mixed signal circuits integrating low-noise bipolar amplifiers with CMOxxxxxxke InP, simple commercial SiGe amplifiers are readily available, but the more complex ICs requires a designer and the use of a commercial fabrication line. One benefit of this workshop will be introducing cryogenic technologists to these specialized designers of InP and SiGe ICs, in order to form new partnerships. Along with these semi-commercial technologies there are several new amplifier concepts still in the research phase including superconducting parametric amplifiers and RF/xxxxxx SQUID amplifiers. These amplifier technologies offer the possibility of quantum limited noise at frequencies as high as 300 GHz, but since they are research topics themselves they are not generally available. Again by bringing the researches working on these less developed technologies together with end-users we hope to create opportunities for collaboration. In general, the use of low-noise and quantum limited amplifiers can improve the sensitivity of many instruments and enable new ones. Some of these amplifier technologies are already being used in detector systems, but many are new or may be of benefit to additional xxxxxx projects. This workshop will allow cryogenic instrument builders and amplifier experts learn about these technologies and find new opportunities for collaboration.	15187

Lightweight High Temperature Non-Eroding Throat Materials for Propulsion Systems, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	The innovation in this proposed effort is the development oflightweight, non-eroding nozzle materials for use in propulsion systems.xxxxxxweight structures are desirable for space transportation vehiclesystems in order to reduce launch costs, increase missionflexibility/efficiency, and add robustness with respect to the abilityto add weight or additional materials to the mission with minimumsacrifice in performance.  The use of non-eroding materials, coupledwith lightweight materials, as rocket nozzles can further increasemission flexibility by allowing an increase in performance, highermaximum temperatures, greater speeds, greater range, bigger payloads,and longer lifetimes.  The higher maximum temperatures may eliminate theneed for cooling air, while simultaneously increasing engine efficiency.Higher maximum use temperature additionally allows for increasedstagnation temperatures and pressures, increasing the propellantenthalpy, which, in return, can significantly increase the velocity andperformance of the projectile.  These benefits result in increased fuelsavings.  The advanced materials study will include monolithic ceramics,refractory metals, and high temperature ceramic matrix composite (CMC)materials.  The manufacturing processes for the monolithic ceramics andrefractory metal materials will include hot isostatic processing (HIP),vacuum plasma spraying (VPS), electrodeposition.  The CMC fabricationprocesses will include braiding, filament winding, tape wrapping, andinvolute layup.	15189

Computational Modeling of Nondestructive Evaluation, Defect Detection, and Defect Identification for CFRP Composite Materials	2018-01-01	2018-07-19	The objective of the proposed work is to improve NDE state-of-the-art for detection and identification of manufacturing and service-initiated defects in xxxxxx composite structures.  The work will utilize computational models of the interaction of NDE probing energy fields with the composite structure and the imbedded defect, to study 1) the measured signal dependence on material and defect properties (forward problem), and ultimately, 2) the assessment of performance-critical defect properties from analysis of NDE signals (inverse problem).  xxxxxxrally speaking, the forward problem is mathematically well-posed, amenable to a well-established array of computational approaches, whereas the inverse problem is by-and-large ill-posed, and in need of novel conceptual development leading to robust meaningful solutions.Regarding the forward problem, computational models will be employed appropriate for simulation of NDE measurements in potentially large complicated geometry composite laminate structures.  Work will primarily address ultrasound and thermography NDE modalities.  A premise of the work is the availability of computational models capable of predicting measurement response for specified NDE measurement instrumentation systems, composite structures, and embedded defects.  CNDE has in place computational models for a large relevant class of structural configurations, and is poised to further enhance current simulation capabilities as the proposed research requires, reflecting xxxxxx€™s interests.  This simulation capability provides the infrastructure for handling the forward measurement problem.Regarding the inverse problem (i.e. the determination of flaw characteristics through analysis of measured signals), work will seek to constrain the ill-posed data inversion through optimization of supplemental measures of defect properties.  While measured data is usually insufficient to uniquely determine the defect properties (size, shape, and constituents), a large percentage of solutions compatible with the limited measured data are inconsistent with physical properties of actual defects (e.g. the defect must be contained solely within the structure).  The proposed research will explore the effectiveness of various quantitative measures of defect properties in constraining the ill-posed inversion, and the possibility of formulating measures capable of discriminating between flaw types of particular interest (e.g. ply delamination versus distributed porosity) when applied to xxxxxxian estimation of defect properties using limited measured data.The effectiveness of the computational models will be benchmarked against experimentally measured signals in composite structures containing defects possessing known properties.  The computational tools will facilitate the design of NDE inspections, so as to provide an effective balance of defect sensitivity and efficient large area coverage.  xxxxxxhough explicit demonstration will be limited primarily to ultrasound and thermography, the concepts emerging from the proposed work will be applicable to a broad range of NDE modalities.	15191

This switch will be capable with a single momentary electrical activation. This bi-stable solution will allow for a lightweight, compact, and controlled solution of deployment for multiple smallsat components such as latches, hinges, reflectors, booms, etc. This technology will not be limited by mission size or application, it is capable of scalability for a large range of applications.	15192

Passively Powered and Programmable Sensor-RFID for ISHM Systems, Phase II	2012-01-01	2018-07-19	To date there are several approaches for incorporating sensing capabilities into RFID. xxxxxx tags use batteries to power their communication circuitry, sensors, and microcontroller. xxxxxx tags benefit from relatively long wireless range and can achieve high data and sensor activity rates. xxxxxxver, the batteries required by active tags are disadvantageous for device cost, lifetime, weight, and volume. In contrast, passive sensor tags receive all of their operating power from external RF transmitting sources and are not limited by battery life. One attractive feature of passive sensor tags is the prospect of permanently embedding them in objects for structural monitoring. Another is their suitability for applications in which neither batteries nor wired connections are feasible, for weight, volume, cost, or other reasons. A limitation of purely passive sensor tags is the requirement of proximity to a RF transmitter. Since lower power consumption is one major trend in RF circuit design, a self-powered system by means of energy harvesting becomes very attractive. It can serve as the enabling technology for novel applications such as ambient intelligence. Using a power harvesting technique for wireless rechargeable battery smart sensor and enhanced RFID are the key elements for successfully distributing sensors across sensor networks.	15195

Metric Tracking of Launch Vehicles, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx needs reliable, accurate navigation for launch vehicles and other missions. GPS is the best world-wide navigation system, but operates at low power making it susceptible to intentional and unintentional interference. xxxxxx proposes to develop an xxxxxxjam front-end that uses xxxxxx to suppress interference, and implement it in a compact, low-cost package.This design will work with any existing GPS receiver, although higher performance can be achieved by tightly integrating a GPS receiver module with the xxxxxxjam functionality. xxxxxx's Miniature xxxxxxted Direction-finding Attitude-determining Anti-jam xxxxxx (MIDAAS(TM)) obtains position, velocity, attitude, and time (PVAT) measurements directly from GPS signals. The ultra-tightly coupled (xxxxxx) navigation architecture fuses all sensor data. xxxxxxting this system with the xxxxxxjam module makes the system inherently robust to interference and the resulting position and attitude estimate more accurate.	15197
Maneuvering Environment for Tiltwing Aircraft with Distributed Electric Propulsion, Phase I	2018-06-01	2018-07-19	The tiltwing class of aircraft consists of vehicles with the ability to rotate the wing and propulsion system as a unit a full 90 degrees from the standard fixed wing configuration to one in which the wing and thrust axisbecome perpendicular to the body axis. This thrust vectoring capability allows the aircraft to utilize thrust borne flight for vertical takeoff and landing as well as the conventional configuration for more efficient liftborne flight operations. The pitching moment is typically controlled by one or more propellers that is/are either mounted statically to the tail (xxxxxxir CL-84) or attached to an articulated tail wing plane (xxxxxx). In contrast to a tiltrotor, the lifting and control surfaces of a tiltwing are immersed in the slipstream of the attached propellors, potentially delaying the onset of stall during transitions and also allowing, for example, the ailerons to provide some yaw control in the hover configuration.Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) is a natural enhancement for tiltwing aircraft, where additional thrust can be used in vertical take-off and landing (and transition) operations and then scaled back (and tucked away) for conventional flight operations. The use of a centralized electric power plant for DEP leads to an increased payload capacity without large sacrifices in endurance and efficiency, all while maintaining its VTOL capabilities.Our goal is the development of a flight maneuvering system for distributed electric propulsion, toward this end we propose the development of model analysis and design tools and techniques focused in particular on the transition maneuvers. The proposed innovation will facilitate the development of analytical tools and methods with which to assess the tiltwing vehicles using DEP; this includes aerodynamic force and moment models for transition,dynamic simulations for trajectory exploration, and tools for trajectory optimization.	15198
A Local Distributed Peer-to-Peer Algorithm Using Multi-Party Optimization Based Privacy Preservation for Data Mining Primitive Computation	2010-09-22	2018-07-19	This paper proposes a scalable, local privacy-preserving algorithm for distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) data aggregation useful for many advanced data mining/analysis tasks such as average/sum computation, decision tree induction, feature selection, and more. Unlike most multi-party privacy-preserving data mining algorithms, this approach works in an asynchronous manner through local interactions and therefore, is highly scalable. It particularly deals with the distributed computation of the sum of a set of numbers stored at different peers in a P2P network in the context of a P2P web mining application. The proposed optimization-based privacy-preserving technique for computing the sum allows different peers to specify different privacy requirements without having to adhere to a global set of parameters for the chosen privacy model. Since distributed sum computation is a frequently used primitive, the proposed approach is likely to have significant impact on many data mining tasks such as multi-party privacypreserving clustering, frequent itemset mining, and statistical aggregate computation.	15199
Electro-Thermal Actuation Control for Unlocking Memory Metal Power Generation & Energy Conversion	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	The work will be subdivided into four stages. The first stage will construct a test bed fixture with actively cooled and heated side blocks on two sides of a Nitinol memory actuator. EFA techniques will than be employed to alternately draw thermal energy to the Nitinol actuator from the thermally controlled side blocks. Once effective arrangements are obtained the thermal flow attributes will be characterized with the aid of thermal imaging for designing a fully enclosed housing. From this, an xxxxxx-Thermal Actuation Control can be designed with no moving parts and very low power consumption. The second stage will involve control circuitry development. The circuitry for continually alternating the thermal energy pull from the hot and cool blocks will be designed, constructed and refined into a footprint suitable for packaging into prototype devices. The third stage will employ energy generating coils. The coils will be constructed and added to the test bed arrangements for exploring the energy generating capabilities of the apparatus. The fourth stage will refine the entire system into a prototype unit. The prototype unit will be constructed with a thermal fin for air cooling on one side with a thermal mounting block on the other. This will allow experimental data collection to be gathered when the unit is fixed firmly against thermal sources. The unit will be used to evaluate the net power generation from different thermal sources. The potential to obtain around 1000 watts of power when fastened to a modest thermal source from the table top sized prototype is highly probable.	15200

Technologies Enabling Custom Radiation-Hardened Component Development, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Two primary paths are available for the creation of a xxxxxx.  The first approach is to use a radiation hardened process such as existing xxxxxx foundries.  These foundries use special processing steps to decrease the total ionizing dose issues, but do not reduce the single event effects.  The second approach is to use a special standard cell library containing hardening techniques that can be built on a standard state-of-the-art commercial foundry.  This cell library must compensate for the unhardened foundry by using special layout techniques to retain the ability to operate through the total ionizing dose experienced in the radiation environments.  These techniques are generally referred to as radiation hardened-by-design layout techniques (RHBD).   For hardening of the circuit architectures against upsets from the single event effects, both the commercial and the xxxxxx foundries must incorporate some type of mitigation scheme requiring special transistor interconnects or redundant nodes.  This program will fill this void, providing the space community with the ability to easily acquire the RHBD xxxxxx standard cell libraries for use with commercial ASIC design flows. The library will include a full suite of IO pads designed by xxxxxx and successfully implemented in test chip designs at 90nm and 65nm.  Finally, a portion of the custom via programmable structured ASIC fabric designed by xxxxxx and xxxxxx will be made available to the library users.  This fabric can be embedded into a design which can be modified and reprogrammed by generating just via 3 mask layer, which can lead to a substantial cost savings over a complete new ASIC design. This program will allow xxxxxx to transform its custom libraries into synthesis libraries, and enable other companies the opportunity to use a proven and fully characterized RHBD ASIC cell library and suite of Mega Cell hard IP for rapidly developing spaceborne systems.	15202

Hybrid-Electric Aircraft TOGW Development Tool with Empirically-Based Airframe and Physics-Based Hybrid Propulsion System Component Analysis, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	Hybrid-Electric distributed propulsion (xxxxxx) is becoming widely accepted and new tools will be required for future development.  This xxxxxx I xxxxxx proposal creates a turbo-electric, hybrid electric propulsion system sizing and weight synthesis tool specifically designed for use in an MDAO framework.  It will offer significant flexibility regarding placement of the propulsive devices for top-level hybrid design, including over-wing, under-wing, split-wing, fuselage pylon-mounted, and other configurations.  The user will supply power required, fan speed, fan torque, TOGW estimation, desired power split between engines and batteries, and selection for propulsion system locations.  Sizing and weight analysis for electric motors, generators, speed controllers, gearboxes, cables, transformers, batteries, and cooling systems will be considered including structural considerations for heavily modified aircraft components for each system.  The outputs will be hybrid electric propulsion system weight, sizes for the sub-system components, and revised xxxxxx specific TOGW calculation.  The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a tool within a framework for top-level and conceptual hybrid electric propulsion studies.  Additionally, the fidelity of the current xxxxxx models is based on empirical-data and extrapolations.  This proposed tool will employ physic-based models with empirical corrections, when needed.  A xxxxxx and future commercialization plan have been identified.	15210
Ultra High Barrier Nanocomposites, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	As the length of manned space missions increase, requirements to sustain those missions increase proportionately. Daily food supplies require food packaged and sent from earth, preparation mechanisms and waste treatment. The window for food preservation could be 3-5 years. This will require food packaging that provides excellent barriers to water vapor and oxygen, is durable at the processing conditions (retort sterilizing, microwave processing), and has low mass. xxxxxx and disposal of used food packaging becomes a significant issue. xxxxxxineration is a reasonable waste treatment strategy, but is incompatible with materials used currently for high barrier packaging, like aluminum foil (which leaves ash).TDA xxxxxxearch, xxxxxx. proposes to develop a multilayer nanocomposite film with superb resistance to permeation by water vapor and oxygen, for use as an extended shelf life food packaging material.  We propose to prepare nanocomposites from commercially available packaging plastics and TDA's surface-modified nanoparticles.  TDA's nanocomposite research has focused on the design of surface treatments to produce nanoparticles compatible with targeted host polymers.  We can form well-dispersed nanocomposites with several packaging plastics and have seen improved barrier properties -- with nanoparticle contents less than 5%.  xxxxxx at the end of the xxxxxx contract will be at xxxxxx 5.	15211
Improved Forecasting of Solar Particle Events and their Effects on Space Electronics, Phase II	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	High-energy space radiation from xxxxxx xxxxxxs and xxxxxxar xxxxxx xxxxxx (SPEs) pose significant risks to equipment and astronaut health in xxxxxx missions. Energetic particles from SPEs associated with flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may adversely affect not only beyond-xxxxxx missions, but also aircraft avionics, communications, and airline crew/passenger health. It is crucial to develop a capability to forecast SPEs and their effects on systems to guide planning of mission-related tasks and risk mitigation strategies.CFD xxxxxxearch Corporation (CFDRC), xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx in xxxxxx (UAH), and xxxxxx xxxxxxersity (VU) propose to develop a comprehensive forecasting capability - SPE Forecast (SPE4) - comprising state-of-the-art modules integrated within a novel computational framework. SPE4 will include: (a) the MAG4 code for probability forecasts of flares/CMEs, and SPEs, (b) the xxxxxx code for solar particle transport through the heliosphere, (c) xxxxxx-based transport calculations including geomagnetic modulation and atmospheric interactions (for avionics) to yield spectra of SPE-induced energetic protons/heavy ions, interfaced to (d) the CR?ME96 code for calculation of resulting effects in electronics. In xxxxxx I, we demonstrated the superior capability of MAG4, xxxxxx, and xxxxxx for their respective tasks using a prior solar event case. A controller script was developed for automated code execution and data transfer across interfaces. Functionality of the overall event-to-effects capability was demonstrated using the 28-Sep-2012 event. We developed a concept of the final software product for xxxxxx based on client-server architecture. In xxxxxx, we will collaborate with VU to interface calculated particle spectra with CR?ME96 to determine single-event effects in electronics. We will enhance robustness, accuracy, and execution speed via improved models and procedures, and demonstrate the software for persistent 24x7 SPE monitoring.	15212
NDE Big Data Framework, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	"NDE data has become \"Big xxxxxx\", and is overwhelming the abilities of NDE technicians and commercially available tools to deal with it. In the current state of the art in industrial practice, there is no integration of the NDE data into design data, NDE models, and structural integrity models for a holistic structural capability assessment. Our proposal responds to these issues described in the subtopic H13.01, xxxxxxanced NDE xxxxxx and xxxxxx.TRI/xxxxxx, xxxxxx State xxxxxxersity's Center for Nondestructive Evaluation (CNDE), and Computational xxxxxx are teaming to develop a coherent set of tools for NDE and SHM data: the NDExxxxxx&#153;. The significance of the innovations are that these sets of tools enable \"big data\" methods to be applied to NDE, and to integrate NDE within the digital thread of design, manufacturing, and operation of large composite structures for space and aerospace applications."	15213

Airport Ground Resource Planning Tool, Phase II	2008-12-01	2018-07-19	This effort undertakes the creation of xxxxxx (AGRP) tool.  Little or no automation is currently available to support airport ground resource allocation decisions.  The AGRP tool provides visualization both of the resource assignments as well as other information relevant to making resource assignment decision.  In addition, AGRP automates or advises resource assignments, improving efficiency while reducing workload.  In xxxxxx 2, we propose to continue development of the AGRP tool through four work areas.  First, we will complete the map and xxxxxxource Allocation displays.  We will also complete the algorithm to automate resource allocation decisions and integrate it with the displays.  The resulting AGRP prototype will be evaluated operationally.  We will also extend the xxxxxx work to develop a block out time predictor, which would have tremendous application and benefit in other traffic management systems.  In xxxxxx, we proposed an architecture in which applications such as AGRP can subscribe to receive SMS data via a standardized interface.  In xxxxxx 2 we will complete the specifications for and implementation of this interface, which will replace the existing SMS client-server communication.	15215
PLUTO-CHARON MUTUAL EVENTS V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	During the period 1985-1990, the earth entered the orbital plane of xxxxxx and its moon xxxxxx, and the mutual eclipse events were observed from ground-based observatories.

The Fabrication of Ultra-Lightweight Full-Shell X-ray Optics by 3D-Printing (Year 2)	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	The proposal seeks to demonstrate printing of material directly onto a precisely figured mandrel in order to eliminate secondary forming and polishing steps after the printing process. The first process is to electroform a very thin (i.e., 50 micron) layer of Ni onto a mandrel. Afterward the ceramic is printed onto the electroformed nickel, heat treated at low temperature, and then released. The second approach is to use a thin film release layer such as xxxxxx Nitride (xxxxxx) which is deposited on the mandrel prior to printing of the ceramic. After printing the ceramic is heat treated at low temperature and then released.	15218
Algorithms for Spectral Decomposition with Applications	2010-09-22	2018-07-19	The analysis of spectral signals for features that represent physical phenomenon is ubiquitous in the science and engineering communities. There are two main approaches that can be taken to extract relevant features from these high-dimensional data streams. The first set of approaches relies on extracting features using a physics-based paradigm where the underlying physical mechanism that generates the spectra is used to infer the most important features in the data stream. We focus on a complementary methodology that uses a data-driven technique that is informed by the underlying physics but also has theability to adapt to unmodeled system attributes and dynamics. We discuss the following four algorithms: xxxxxxl xxxxxx (SDA), Non-Negative xxxxxx Factorization (NMF), Independent Component xxxxxx (ICA) and Principal Components xxxxxx (PCA) and compare their performance on a spectral emulator which we use to generate artificial data with known statistical properties. This spectral emulator mimics the real-world phenomena arising from the plume of the space shuttle main engine and can be used to validate the results that arise from various spectral decomposition algorithms and is very useful for situations where real-world systems have very low probabilities of fault or failure. Our results indicate that methods like SDA and NMF provide a straightforward way of incorporating prior physical knowledge while NMF with a tuning mechanism can give superior performance on some tests. We demonstrate thesealgorithms to detect potential system-health issues on data from a spectral emulator with tunable health parameters.	15219

Bladder materials to be tested include:   ArmorFlex 101 (Polyurethane, gas barrier, polyurethane)  ArmorFlex 101 w/ Nylon rip-stop   xxxxxxClay xxxxxxClay w additional gas barrier layer xxxxxxclay w/ rip-stop  CEPAC HD-200 (Bigelow bladder preferred embodiment)Inflatable structures will require low permeable bladder to metallic seal interface.  Cold flow of bladder materials over time is not acceptable for long term missions where materials cannot be easily inspected or replaced.  Reliable seal interfaces are required.  Inflatable habitats can provide the volume necessary for space colonization at a lower cost than traditional habitats. Sealing bladder materials capable of deploying at cold temperatures is essential for deep space missions and likely LOE missions due to operational constraints	15220

A 16384-channel 8GHz Bandwidth Polyphase Spectrometer, Phase II	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	Growing concern over global climatic and environmental changes and our urgent need to quantify track and understand their impact on our planet's atmosphere, oceans, and land surfaces have prompted the development of extremely sensitive and technologically sophisticated instruments. To meet the challenges of these next generation instruments, a new class of high performance electronics needs to be developed.In this xxxxxx xxxxxx proposal, Mosaix proposes to design and build two separate low power, and  compact single board digital poly-phase Fast xxxxxx Transform spectrometer (FFTS) optimized for the back-end signal processing requirements of next generation instruments. These two spectrometer designs are targeted to meet different mission requirements and leverage a common FPGA based digital electronic design and spectrometer IP core. xxxxxx sharing a common architecture, the boards differ in the analog-to-digital (ADC) samplers used at the front-end of the spectrometer and the actual FPGA device used for the digital signal processing tasks. The first spectrometer design is for a 8 GHz bandwidth spectrometer targeted for earth observing (EOS) missions.  The second spectrometer design is for a 750 MHz bandwidth spectrometer targeted for planetary radiometer missions. The spectrometers developed under this xxxxxx will be state-of-the-art spectrometers.	15222
Improved Rock Core Sample Break-off, Retention and Ejection System, Phase II	2012-06-01	2018-07-19	The proposed effort advances the design of an innovative core sampling and acquisition system with improved core break-off, retention and ejection features.  xxxxxx successfully demonstrated, at xxxxxx 4, the ability of the system to acquire rock core samples that are 10 mm diameter and 100 mm long.  The proposed innovation employs a different drill tube design in the vicinity of the core that does not impose any loads on the core and does not rotate relative to the core.  This novel technique actually envelopes and protects the core as it is generated.  The benefits are two fold; first, the integrity of the core is maintained and second, core ejection is much easier which greatly reduces, if not eliminates the risk of the core jamming within the drill tube/bit.  These improvements can be obtained without increasing the annulus of the drill bit that would otherwise require more down force, torque, power and bit wear.  By the end of the proposed xxxxxx 2 effort, a prototype design of the improved coring system will be tested at xxxxxx 6 with xxxxxx ambient conditions.	15223
Reconfigurable, Cognitive Software Defined Radio, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	Intelligent Automation xxxxxx, (IAI) is currently developing a softwaredefined radio (SDR) platform that can adaptively switch betweendifferent modes of operation for communication, by modifying bothtransmit waveforms and receive signal-processing tasks on the fly.High-speed analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters along withmodern FPGAs and fast digital signal processors allow for maximumflexibility in digital radio design.  The proposed softwarereconfigurable radio implementation technique and the system design willleverage IAI's vast experience in SDR, RF hardware design, signalprocessing and system level firmware design.  xxxxxx innovations of theproposed effort are  Reconfigurable digital transceiver/ waveformsynthesizer design using high speed FPGA.   xxxxxx-mode radiofunctionality and scalable architecture.

An Automated High Aspect Ratio Mesher for Computational Fluid Dynamics, Phase I	2011-01-01	2018-07-19	Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are routinely used while designing, analyzing, and optimizing air- and spacecraft.  An important component of CFD simulations is mesh generation, or discretization into polygonal or polyhedral cells, of the domain being analyzed.  The overall computational cost and accuracy of simulations depend heavily on mesh quality -- the size, shape, and structure of the cells.  Another important aspect of CFD simulation is that solutions are achieved iteratively, with each subsequent pass decreasing error and increasing solution accuracy.  xxxxxx adaption uses output from the last simulation to improve the mesh for the next.  xxxxxx is a CFD simulator developed at xxxxxx that requires both a tight integration with mesh generation software for grid adaption and the generation of high aspect ratio cells (i.e. 10,000:1) to accurately capture dynamics around boundary layers.Current meshing methods use the well known advancing front or xxxxxx, and the user must often perform multiple manual inputs and interactions to generate a mesh of sufficient quality.  Ideally, a meshing module would subdivide complex designs and perform grid adaption automatically, with little or no human intervention.  The proposed innovation is the development of a very high aspect ratio mesher that demonstrates a significant improvement over current techniques as measured by the time and effort necessary for xxxxxx users to solve CFD problems.	15225
Optical Obstacle Avoidance System for Lunar and Mars Landing, Phase I	2008-01-01	2018-07-19	The systems developed at fibertek for Obstacle-xxxxxx has so far all been operated at 1560nm.  Such an operation is required due to the required eye-safety constraint.    This wavelength range has so far shown reduced efficiency to a 30% optical-optical efficiency in the last stage of optical amplification in the fiber based transmitter we have developed.  For space applications, we believe a highly efficient transmitter will be required with associated optical receiver technology.  We propose here to develop a highly efficient, very versatile transmitter based on Ytterbium-doped fiber amplifiers.  Associated with this transmitter we will demonstrate a coherent detection system allowing for both range and velocity measurements during space vehicle landing. The technology required for the transmitter/receiver and scanning is at xxxxxx 5.  A successful xxxxxx STTR should allow for field testing bringing this xxxxxx to 6.	15226

Carbon Nano-Composite Ablative Rocket Nozzles, Phase I	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	The constantly evolving science of nanotechnology keeps coming around to old ideas re-tooled with new technologies.  Though much work has been done examining the potential for nanotechnology to be used in ablative materials in a rocket nozzle, there have been relatively few testing opportunities of this application.  xxxxxx nanofiber (CNF) composites have been identified as a lightweight and effective material that could be used in rocket motor applications.  This technology when used in rocket nozzles could exhibit increased ablation resistance in the throat area and lower backside temperatures that would allow higher temperatures inside the nozzle.  This could translate into a nozzle lighter in mass and higher in durability than conventional ablative nozzles.  Benefits from this application could trickle across the board of high-temperature and dynamic pressure environments of different types of rocket motors.	15228
The Quiet Rotary Power and Information Transformer Converter, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	Many satellites, spacecraft, and radar antennas with spun and de-spun configurations require the transfer of power across rotating interfaces in lieu of slip rings and/or flexures.  This is particularly true for systems that have to demonstrate a long life expectancy.  The rotary transformer has desirable characteristics of high reliability and low noise, which qualify it as a viable replacement for slip rings.  The rotary transformer is essentially the same as a conventional transformer, except that the geometry is arranged so that the primary and secondary can be rotated with respect to each other with negligible changes in electrical characteristics.  The power transfer is enabled by magnetic coupling across an air gap.  There are not any wearing contacts, noise or contamination problems due to lubrication or wear debris.  The development of a rotary power transformer will use the same ?xxxxxx? technology that was used on WF/PC-II, Articulated Fold, xxxxxx (Hubbell xxxxxx xxxxxx), xxxxxx and xxxxxx 05 Op-Nav Camera.	15229

Dynamic Airspace Concepts for Integration of UAS into the NAS, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	To address these critical needs associated with the integration of xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxs (UAS) into the airspace, we propose to conduct research on the application of xxxxxx (DAC) concepts and algorithms to the challenge of accommodation and integration of UAS into the NAxxxxxx resulting algorithms and capabilities will provide real-time recommendations to Traffic Management xxxxxxs (TMCs) in the ATC system regarding the airspace boundaries that should be adopted, when the airspace boundaries should be changed and how long they should remain in place, and the necessary flight routes and other procedures that should be assigned to flights (both manned and unmanned) to ensure the safety and efficiency of all operations.	15231
Biomaterials out of thin air: in situ, on-demand printing of advanced biocomposites	2014-05-01	2018-07-19	The concept is that a 3D array of bioengineered living cells deposits materials, both biological and inorganic, that are bound into nonliving, microstructured finished products.    Imagine being able to print anything from tools and composite building materials to food and human tissues. Imagine being on xxxxxx with the ability to replace any broken part, whether it's a part of your spacesuit, your habitat, or your own body. We propose a technique that would allow just that. By printing 3D arrays of cells engineered to secrete the necessary materials, the abundant in situ resources of atmosphere and regolith become organic, inorganic, or organic-inorganic composite materials. Such materials include novel, biologically derived materials not previously possible to fabricate.	15232
RAP Figuring slumped mirrors to remove mid-spatial frequency errors, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	Future X-ray telescopes require significant amounts of optical area. To accommodate this in a grazing incidence design, extremely thin mirrors are formed in concentric shell configurations. A slumping technique has been demonstrated with such thin, lightweight shells. xxxxxxver, the optical surface is found to contain a significant amount of mid-spatial frequency errors. It is proposed to demonstrate  a sub-aperture figuring technique that does not impart mid-spatial frequencies to the optical substrate geometries planned for integration into next-generation X-ray telescopes.Reactive xxxxxx (RAP) is a sub-aperture, atmospheric pressure, non-contact figuring technology that relies on a deterministic gas-phase etching of the optical surface with high material removal rates. RAP has already been demonstrated as a very credible approach for fabricating the lightweight wedges required for the assembly of such mirrors. RAP is especially suitable for damage-free processing of extremely lightweight mirrors given the non-contact operation, and its ability to ameliorate sub-surface damage. The tool footprint is a xxxxxx and hence has a limited capability to both impart mid-spatial errors, as well as to fix them. In phase 1, we plan on demonstrating the ability of the RAP process to impart minimal mid-spatial errors into the optical surface while a figuring demonstration using adjustable footprints is planned for phase 2.	15233

Vehicle Staging Analysis of the Transition to Supersonic Retropropulsion During Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing	2018-08-01	2018-07-19	The landing of xxxxxx represents the upper limit of current xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and xxxxxxding (EDL) capabilities for xxxxxx exploration. The succession from the current state of the art along xxxxxxs goal of extending and sustaining human presence in our solar system will require landing large robotic (~10 mT) and human class payloads (~40-80 mT) on xxxxxx with landed accuracies on the order of meters. To rise to this challenge, new EDL technologies must be developed. The xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and xxxxxxding xxxxxxs xxxxxx (EDL  SA) Study identifies supersonic retropropulsion (SRP) as a promising, mission enabling technology for high mass and human xxxxxx missions.The goal of my research is to develop nominal, detailed designs and requirements for SRP transition architectures for xxxxxx high mass entry vehicles. These configurations are envisioned to guide future SRP technology development and investigation, specifically in the definition of propulsion system requirements, aeroscience configuration-dependent investigations, and further SRP configuration and transition architecture development. My research into this topic will include an extensive literature review of recent configuration, packaging, and staging analyses applicable to high mass xxxxxx missions as well as review of relevant sub-systems literature such as hypersonic decelerators, SRP sub-systems, terminal descent propulsion and control requirements, previous transition architectures, and transition separation methods. xxxxxxing off the transition architectures recommend by the EDL-SA study, I will develop six degree-of-freedom models and simulations of aerodynamic and multibody dynamic behavior of high mass entry vehicles relative to their jettisoned masses over nominal xxxxxx EDL trajectories. To aid the multibody dynamics analysis, CFD solvers will be used to determine detailed aerodynamic interactions between entry bodies and jettisoned masses. Specific aerodynamic interactions to be investigated, characterized, and modeled include the suction phenomena occurring between an entry body and an ejected mass shortly after jettison and near and far-field recontact risks. In parallel with aerodynamic and multibody dynamic analyses, ballistic coefficient ratios between entry vehicles and jettisoned masses will be characterized and developed such that recontact risks are minimized. Supersonic ballistic analyses will build off of similar subsonic analyses for previous xxxxxx missions.xxxxxx design analysis will focus on characterizing and designing separation systems to disconnect and jettison hypersonic decelerators away from the entry body during supersonic flight. Heritage pyro-separation and guide-rail systems will be evaluated for potential feed-forward inclusion into supersonic separation systems. xxxxxx on the recommendations of the EDL-SA study, entry vehicle divert maneuvers following jettison events and RCS thrusting maneuvers to dispose of aeroshells after separation will be considered and analyzed as possible methods to minimize jettisoned mass recontact risks. xxxxxx-objective optimization techniques will be used to trade potential recontact risks with transition system complexity, reliability, and cost. To determine contributions to total mission uncertainty due to these transition systems, I will perform xxxxxxure of xxxxxx evaluations according to the techniques and weighting schemes defined in the EDL-SA study.As a final component of my research, I will investigate alternatives to configurations considered in the EDL-SA that do not necessarily require a supersonic forebody jettison event. Specifically, aftbody SRP configurations will be investigated. My analysis will focus on defining derived requirements on transitions architectures and systems for these configurations. All previous transition analyses will be reapplied to aftbody SRP configurations so that meaningful comparisons can be drawn between different configuration types.	15235

Multispectral Panoramic Imaging System, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	International xxxxxxnic xxxxxxs Corporation, a leader in the design of precision imaging systems, will develop an innovative multispectral, panoramic imaging system for use on exploratory landing craft. During xxxxxx I, IEM will build upon and advance alternative strategies, including our patent pending Synthetic xxxxxx (SynthFOV) technology and our Pan/Tilt Mirror xxxxxx (PTMS), initially conceived by IEM for the USMC Gladiator UGV. These two technologies will eliminate or significantly reduce the use of conventional moving parts, will decrease power demand, will reduce launch weight, and will require less space than current imaging systems. SynthFOV incorporates an array of Off-Axis xxxxxx to focus light to a sensor via a series of optically precise mirrors. The PTMS uses a centrally configured mirror that rotates and tilts along both horizontal and vertical axes thereby directing the reflected light to a sensor. xxxxxxernative configurations include use of two imagers for stereo panoramic imaging; incorporating filter wheels for multispectral imaging on a single sensor; use of multiple sensors for imaging visible, near IR, and other wavelengths, and use of multispectral lenses to further reduce weight. IEM will evaluate these and other alternatives and will demonstrate the applicability of the selected approach through pre-prototype testing.	15237
Domain Specific Language for Geant4 Parallelization for Space-based Applications, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	A major limiting factor in xxxxxx growth is the requirement to parallelize codes to leverage emerging architectures, especially as single core performance has plateaued and architectures like short vector units (e.g., AVX), Intel xxxxxx, and xxxxxx are embraced by hardware manufactures. The proposed SIMD/SIMT vectorization tools for emerging accelerator-based compute architectures will impact a world-wide range of academic, government, and commercial researchers.The xxxxxx toolkit enables the simulations of the passage of particles through matter.  As with many scientific codes, it was originally developed for single processor compute nodes using compute clusters, and has not been optimized for SIMD/SIMT architectures (e.g., many-core nodes, xxxxxx, short vector units, and other xxxxxx, e.g., Intel xxxxxx. Therefore, optimizations and code rewrites are required to target each new architecture.This project will develop two tools to aid in the parallelization of compute applications for SIMD/SIMT architectures.  The first tool will perform a dynamic analysis to determine the potential to extract SIMD/SIMT parallelization from an application.

This xxxxxx Library will be fully indexed and searchable, and will serve as a central information repository for facilitating communication and collaboration between team members, preserving important models, data, and knowledge for future reuse, and helping to capture design knowledge and document the decision making process."	15239
Cloud discrimination for ASCENDS Mission Based on Optical Phase Conjugation as a Novel Approach, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	PI at Arkxxxxxx proposes a novel scheme for making cloud discriminationin the wavelength ranges of near-IR (1-1.8 m) and mid-IR (3-4 m). Thisscheme is based on optical phase conjugation from a second-ordernonlinear medium. It overcomes the disadvantages of slow speed inphotorefractive media and poor reflectivities in third-order nonlinearmaterials. During xxxxxx, she will design novel phase-conjugate mirrorsoperating at the signal wavelengths of 1.27 m and 1.57 m. xxxxxxly,she will fabricate the designed phase-conjugate devices. The next stepwill be testing of the fabricated devices by investigating sum-frequencyand difference-frequency generation in the transverse geometry. She willalso carry out modeling efforts on the device performances for makingcloud discrimination. This xxxxxx project will be carried out incollaboration with Prof. xxxxxx at Lehigh xxxxxxersity who is one of thepioneers in optical phase conjugation. The anticipated results for xxxxxx2 include implementation and testing of the phase-conjugate mirrorsoperating at 1.27 m and 1.57 m for correcting phase distortion andmaking cloud discrimination, optimization of the phase-conjugatemirrors, finding solutions to practical issues for deploying thesemirrors in the ASCENDS mission, expansion of input wavelengths,incorporation with frequency up-conversion devices, and reports.	15240

Brine Dewatering Using Ultrasonic Nebulization, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	Recovery of water from brine is critically important for manned spaceexploration.  xxxxxx of water is prohibitively costly for extendedmissions.  It is anticipated that xxxxxx will pool urine, hygiene waterand humidity condensate into a combined waste stream that willsubsequently be concentrated into a brine while recovering some but notall of the water, 90-95&#37;.  The concentrated brine that results fromprimary water recovery systems contains a significant amount of water.The proposed innovation will recover virtually all of the remainingwater.  This will be accomplished by ultrasonically creating nebulizeddroplets of the brine that can be readily dried under a partial vacuumwith moderate temperature microwave heating.  The process bears someresemblance to spray drying, but uses much smaller droplets (1.6 m ascompared to xxxxxx).  Small droplets enable quicker drying due to theirhigh relative surface area.  This is particularly important when dryingwastewater brines which contain ingredients that are thermally labileand require drying at relatively low temperatures.  The proposed systemhas no nozzles to become plugged, requires no chemical additives, uses aminimal amount of power, is simple and small, requires minimal astronautattention and uses a continuous, closed cycle process that is gravity independent.	15243

Pointing has been corrected by the C-xxxxxxing process, and these data were derived from the pre-encounter xxxxxx-South Map sequences. In this sequence, the UVS field of view was located near the central meridian of the planet. The field of view stepped slowly from north to south, and then rapidly repositioned to the north. These scans were repeated until all longitudes had been sampled. Coverage in longitude was nearly continuous in time. There were short breaks for observations of satellites.	15244
Thermal Energy Conversion, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx-state thermoelectric (TE) devices provide many advantages in refrigeration (TE coolers) and power generation (TE generators). These highly reliable devices have no moving parts, operate over a large range of temperatures, and do not emit toxic or environmentally-unfriendly gases. These devices can be easily integrated into thermal energy conversion systems that meet xxxxxx needs for innovative space power generation on orbiting platforms, extraterrestrial surfaces, and space transportation vehicles. To date, the adoption of TE generator (TEG) devices in energy scavenging/power recovery applications has been hampered by three primary challenges:- xxxxxx of thermoelectric material compositions with large figures of merit, ZT, that function over a range of operating temperatures- xxxxxx of high throughput production methods that enable large-area, conformable TEG devices- High cost-per-unit area for tiling rigid plate TE devicesProduction of large-area sheets of high-ZT TEG devices that conform to space vehicle and other relevant thermal gradient surfaces acting to scavenge waste heat need specific processes (e.g. roll-to-roll). xxxxxxhmics xxxxxx. proposes to develop thermoelectric devices based on sintering of high-ZT thermoelectric powders. This TEG fabrication method will enable large-area, conformable devices with 1) high thermal-to-electric conversion efficiency, 2) high areal power conversion (W/cm2), 3) large total power recovery (W), 4) high specific power (W/kg), 5) low fabrication cost ($/W), and 6) durability and long operational life.	15245
A Web-Based Airborne Remote Sensing Telemetry Server, Phase I	2006-01-01	2018-07-19	A Web-based xxxxxx xxxxxx Telemetry Server (WARSTS) is proposed to integrate UAV telemetry and web-technology into an innovative communication, command, control, and computer-network (C4) system for operational UAV remote sensing. WARSTS integrates two innovative subsystems: the Tracking xxxxxx Radio Link (TARL) and the Web-based xxxxxxlication Support xxxxxx (WASS). TARL serves as the sensor gateway to WASS. It links a remotely deployed airborne sensor platform and ground control equipment by a high-speed peer-to-peer Wi-Fi link. TARL monitors airborne instruments and UAV operation status continuously while performing selective imaging data transmission. WASS processes the structured UAV platform position/attitude and imaging data and makes them visualizable through an integrated web-enabled application package in realtime. WARSTS features the following capabilities: (1) a realtime sensor fusion algorithm that combines inertial, GPS, magnetometer, and other sensor input to deliver precision airborne platform state vectors at a rate greater than 50 Hz; (2) a set of visualization tools that automatically generate the mapping area mosaic of the remote sensing UAV along with its 3D flight through animation; (3) human-UAV instrument interactive control; (4) hotspot realtime hyperspectral/multispectral data download; and finally (5) a fully featured web-based connectivity solution that speeds up information delivery.	15246
Algorthms and Regolith Erosion Models for the Alert Code, Phase I	2010-01-01	2018-07-19	ORBITEC and xxxxxx xxxxxxersity have teamed on this STTR to develop the ALERT (xxxxxxanced xxxxxx Exhaust-xxxxxx Transport) code which will include new developments in modeling of regolith erosion and entrainment as well as plume transport with full mass and momentum conservation. The Plume is handled in a Vlasov formalism with drag force on dust grains, dust equations of motion are solved over a size spectrum.  Because of its significant gravity and lack of atmosphere landing on the xxxxxx's surface must involve impingement of the rocket plume directly on the xxxxxx regolith. The experience in the xxxxxx landings, both from the perspective of the astronauts viewing surface conditions during decent, and the effects on the exposed surfaces of the Surveyor 3 from the nearby landing of xxxxxx have alerted us to the importance of good modeling of rocket exhaust plume regolith interactions.	15247
Elemental and Chemical State Analysis, XPS, for In-Situ Materials Analysis on Mars, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	This innovation is the design of a monochromatic x-ray source to be used in a mission compatible XPS spectrometer.  Existing x-ray sources for XPS are large, require high power and a will have difficulty meeting the vibration specifications for a mission type instrument.  The small x-ray sources developed for medical applications are exciting but are designed for high energy x-rays and require refractory anodes.  This program will develop a new design suitable for mission applications.  It will focus on small sources similar to the medical devices that will use low power.  The monochromator will be designed for low mass and use a feedback based stabilization to keep it aligned independent of temperature and vibrations associated with missions launch.  The feedback system will use x-ray detectors in a plane near the sample to since the x-ray beam direction and an interment angular vibration to make sure the monochromator is on the optimum angle for diffraction.  After a suitable design is implemented with thermal electron sources, a nanotube excitation sources will be considered.	15248

Low Cost P/M Aluminum Syntactic Foam for Blade Containment in Turbine Engines, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	The proposed xxxxxx I xxxxxx proposes a low density (0.75-1.2g/cc)syntactic aluminum foam energy absorber co-manufactured inside a composite fan case for turbine engines.  Metal syntactic foams provide more energy absorption than any type other metal or non metallic foam on a volumetric basis (80-150J/cm^3). This will provide a lower weight alternative to hard wall fan casings and a smaller wall alternative to soft walled fan casings.  The phase I program will test Syntactic aluminum foam and integrated carbon fiber aluminum syntactic foam panels under high strain rate conditions and under a blade failure ballistic test.	15251

Data Reduction Techniques for Real-time Fault Detection and Diagnosis, and Multiple Fault Inference with Imperfect Tests, Phase II	2011-06-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx downlink data rate constrains the amount of data that can be sent to earth from a spacecraft. xxxxxx from the onboard health monitoring sensors needs to be accommodated within a small fraction of this downlink bandwidth. The problem is more acute for interplanetary missions, where the downlink data rate is significantly lower than the low earth orbit missions. Such constraint prohibits transmission of the complete set of health monitoring data. This proposed xxxxxx effort is geared towards providing enhanced remote diagnostics using limited telemetry bandwidth. xxxxxx accuracy of health management system depends more on the information content of the monitored data, than on its sheer volume. We propose accommodating more information within the allocated downlink bandwidth for health monitoring by performing intelligent data reduction. The onboard data reduction process employs sensor fusion, dimensionality reduction and temporal fusion techniques.	15254
Simplified Hazard Analysis & Reporting ApP	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	Since the crew will be so far away when exploring xxxxxx, it is not going to always be practical for Mission Control to do as many things for them, and one thing they will likely need is a remote capability to perform hazard analysis. Since the crew will have to improvise their own procedures more frequently, being able to assign hazard controls and verifications will become increasingly important for them.&nbsp;To address this issue I&rsquo;m proposing&nbsp; the development of an app that aids the crew to perform simplified hazard analysis. The crew would answers some questions and the app would inform the crew of the hazards that would likely be of concern and would propose basic controls and verifications that should be considered.The crew could then implement hazard controls with greater independent and reduce their exposure to risk. The Simplified xxxxxx xxxxxx &amp; xxxxxx (SHARP) addresses several core needs for humans to voyage deeper into space. First, SHARP gives the crew more autonomy to assess and act to mitigate risk, versus being reliant on earth-based support for hazard assessment, thus meeting HAT Performance xxxxxx 4.7c, xxxxxx Beyond LEO. In a similar vein, HAT Performance xxxxxx 7.5a, Mission Control Automation Beyond LEO, is also relevant since the MER in Mission Control currently provides short turn around hazard assessment, whereas SHARP would allow the crew to do a range of hazard assessment on their own quickly. Additionally, since Mission Control will not be able to converse easily with xxxxxx based crews, there will be a greater need to automate the reporting of data. SHARP will incorporate a feature to send hazard assessment the crew are working on to Mission Control for further analysis.SHARP will be developed in two stages. First, a mapping of the logic to drive the app will be documented. This logic map will develop the questions that will be asked of the crew and the answers that will be returned to them. The focus will be on making the tool user friendly while providing useful control strategies for a broad range of hazardous conditions. xxxxxxond, a prototype app will be developed to act as a testbed for the user interface and prove out the usefulness of the logic map. Finally, at a later time, a reporting function will be incorporated.SHARP will have two product deliverables. The first will be the logic map, which traces a series of questions to a group of answers the inform the crew about the hazards they are likely to encounter in their chosen task, and what controls and verifications they should attempt to implement to mitigate the risk. The second would be a prototype app, which would be the user interface and testbed of the logic map. The app would, with further development, become the end product for the crew.This ICA submission is to take the idea from practical idea (xxxxxx 2) to the prototype phase (xxxxxx 3). The next steps would be to apply for further ICA and other innovation related funding to further refine the useability and the usefulness of the answers provided by the app (xxxxxx 4 &amp; 5). Beyond that, conversations with the S&amp;MA directorate, the xxxxxxn Program, and with other potential stakeholders would take place to initiate a development project once its potential usefulness becomes evident.	15255
Finding Optimal Independent Grasp Regions of Parallel Manipulators with Additional Applications for Limbed Robot Mobility	2021-09-01	2018-07-19	For the problem of robotic manipulation, wherein a robotic manipulator interacts with objects or its environment using an end-effector (gripper), there have been attempts to quantify and optimize how good a hold the gripper has on an object being manipulated using grasp quality metrics. Traditionally, grasp quality analysis assumes a rigid gripper and a rigid object. xxxxxxver, technologies currently being investigated by xxxxxx including climbing robots, robotic transport of surface assets, and robotic grappling of free floating objects rely on compliant grippers, and grippers who primarily apply pulling and shear loads. Of particular interest are microspine and gecko adhesive based grippers currently under development. For such grippers, traditional grasp quality analyses do not apply. The first objective of this proposal is to develop a stiffness based approach to analyze grasp quality accompanied by the theoretical background to evaluate its effectiveness. It is common to use multiple grippers in parallel to perform manipulation tasks. In the case of climbing robot locomotion it is necessary, as each limb/gripper must grasp the surface and work together to move along its trajectory. To accommodate uncertainties, it is desirable to find grasp regions, rather than single grasps, in which the grippers can be placed to achieve their tasks. A novel method for finding such regions is to frame the problem as a bipartite graph problem, where graph edges represent grasp qualities. From this basis, finding grasp regions equates to finding bicliques corresponding to regions of desirable surface geometry. The next objective of this proposal is to develop algorithms for finding regions that are practically useful for grasping, by utilizing and expanding on current graphical and manipulation algorithms.Practical implementations of these algorithms must allow for time-efficient computation of grasps for use in robot planning. The objective is to use techniques including probabilistic methods and example-informed searches to efficiently generate grasp regions that meet or exceed a minimum quality threshold (safety factor) in real time.Finally, it is sometimes necessary to perform in-situ re-grasps. For a climbing robot a grasp may begin to slip, or perform worse than expected, and re-grasping of the surface will be necessary. The objective is to use tools such as in-situ pull testing to detect poor grasps, and develop methods for using this information as feedback to effectively execute a re-grasp.xxxxxxment of this technology directly impacts xxxxxx interests by supplying methods of analyzing and planning for robot manipulation and climbing robot tasks, thereby advancing crucial technologies for robotic space operations and exploration.	15256
rHEALTH X with Non-Invasive Capabilities for Science and Crew Health, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	There is an extraordinary need for a universal biomedical analyzer that has broadly flexible capabilities for cell studies, small animal experiments, and crew member health.  The goal of our rHEALTH X device is to create a single palm-sized device with tripartite capabilities:  non-invasive measurements, cell cytometry analysis, and multiplexed nanostrip tests.  Currently, there is no single device that is able to provide comprehensive non-invasive measurements, let alone combine it with the rHEALTH's significant wet laboratory analytical capabilities.  We have developed the existing rHEALTH technology in collaboration with xxxxxx and here, in this xxxxxx I proposal, we intend to further push the envelope and add a fully non-invasive module.  The module will include measurements of heart rate, xxxxxx, body temperature, respiratory rate, and EKG.  The module will be housed in the back of the rHEALTH X and will be fully detachable for wireless/wearable applications.  At the end of xxxxxx I, we will develop a xxxxxx 4 non-invasive module.  For xxxxxx, we will integrate the module with our existing rHEALTH technology into the rHEALTH X.  We will bring it to xxxxxx 7, so that it can be flight-certified and flown on xxxxxx (xxxxxx) in a timely manner.	15257
Making Predictions using Large Scale Gaussian Processes	2010-09-10	2018-07-19	One of the key problems that arises in many areas is to estimate a potentially nonlinear function [tex] G(x, \theta)[/tex] given input and output samples [tex] ( X,y ) [/tex] so that [tex]y approx G(x, \theta)[/tex].There are many approaches to addressing this regression problem. Neural networks, regression trees, and many other methods have been developed to estimate [tex]$G$[/tex] given the input output pair [tex] ( X,y ) [/tex].One method that I have worked with is called xxxxxx process regression. There many good texts and papers on the subject. For more technical information on the method and its applications see: xxxx key problem that arises in developing these models on very large data sets is that it ends up requiring an [tex]O(N^3)[/tex] computation where N is the number of data points and the training sample. Obviously this becomes very problematic when N is large.I discussed this problem with xxxxxx, a mathematics professor at xxxxxx State xxxxxxersity.  He, along with some of his students, developed a method  to address this problem based on Cholesky decomposition and pivoting.   He also shows that this leads to a numerically stable result.  If ou're interested in some light reading, I’d suggest you take a look at his [recent paper](    ) (which was accepted in the Journal of xxxxxx Learning xxxxxxearch) posted on dashlink. We've also posted code for you to try it out.

Hydrogenous Polymer-Regolith Composites for Radiation-Shielding Materials, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx has identified a need in xxxxxx-topic H11.01 for advanced radiation-shielding technologies using in situ resources, such as regolith, to protect humans from the hazards of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) during extra-terrestrial missions.  The radiation species of greatest interest are light ions (particularly protons), heavy ions (such as iron-56) and neutrons.  International xxxxxxentific Technologies, xxxxxx., in conjunction with The College of William and Mary, proposes the use of regolith combined with hydrogenous polymers to develop radiation-shielding structural materials for habitats.  The program Technical xxxxxxs include selection of hydrogenous polymer binders for use in regolith radiation-shielding materials, fabrication of polymer-regolith specimens designed to shield against galactic cosmic radiation species and to act as structural components in habitats, and acquisition of test data to determine key parameters for the development of optimal radiation-shielding regolith-composite materials.  The innovation is the development of polymer-regolith composites for structural radiation-shielding materials to protect humans on deep-space missions.  The anticipated result is the creation of composite materials that combines in situ resource utilization (ISRU), i.e. regolith, with a hydrogenous polymeric matrix.  Additives, such as boron, could be included to enhance absorption of neutrons generated by interactions of GCR and SPE particles with shielding materials.  The proposed composites have multifunctional properties of radiation shielding against galactic cosmic radiation, neutrons and electromagnetic radiation, and structural integrity to permit use in habitats.	15259
Optical Monitor for Major Air Constituents, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	The well-being of the crew on manned missions depends critical on the composition of the habitat air.  xxxxxx, carbon dioxide and water vapor are the most important air constituents that have to be monitored continuously.  xxxxxxical monitoring with its features of high precision, strong species selectivity and fast response is the preferred method if lightweight, small and low power-draw instrumentation can be developed.  xxxxxx cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) are now available covering a broad wavelength range.  These single frequency light sources are ideal candidates for high performance gas monitoring and especially suited for space applications due to their small size and extremely low power consumption.  Vista Photonics proposes to develop technology based on these lasers that leads to small sensors that fulfill the strict requirements of spaceflight.  The narrowband output of these lasers combined with wavelength modulation spectroscopy and a compact absorption cell will provide superior sensor performance.  Inherent features like sensor health monitoring and recalibration without the use of expendable gases will be incorporated.  The developed sensor will be fully automated and no maintenance will be required.	15260
Effect of microgravity on brain gene expression in mice	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	xxxxxxes in gravitational force such as that experienced by astronauts during space flight induce a redistribution of fluids from the caudad to the cephalad portion of the body together with an elimination of normal head-to-foot hydrostatic pressure gradients. To assess brain gene profile changes associated with microgravity and fluid shift a large-scale analysis of mxxxxxx expression levels was performed in the brains of 2 weeks control and hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice using cDNA microarrays. xxxxxxhough to different extent all functional categories displayed significantly regulated genes indicating that considerable transcriptomic alterations are induced by HU. Interestingly the TIC class (transport of small molecules and ions into the cells) had the highest percentage of up-regulated genes while the most down-regulated genes were those of the JAE class (Cell junction Adhesion Extracellular xxxxxx). TIC genes comprised 16% of those whose expression was altered including sodium channel nonvoltage-gated 1 beta (Scnn1b) glutamate receptor (Grin1) voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (Vdac1) calcium channel beta 3 subunit (Cacnb3) and others. The analysis performed by xxxxxxMAPP revealed several altered protein classes and functional pathways such as blood coagulation and immune response learning and memory ion channels and cell junction. In particular data indicate that HU causes an alteration in hemostasis which resolves in a shift toward a more hyper-coagulative state with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Furthermore HU treatment seems to impact on key steps of synaptic plasticity and learning processes. We used brains of four control (C1 C2 C3 C4) and four tail-suspended hindlimb-unloaded (E1 E2 E3 E4) mice to ensure statistical relevance of the study. 60 ug of total xxxxxx extracted in xxxxxx from each brain was reversed transcribed into labeled cDNAs using fluorescent Cy5 or Cy3-dUTP (Amersham xxxxxxsciences NJ). Differently labeled cDNAs obtained from a pair of biological replicas were co-hybridized overnight at 50C with a microscope slide spotted with ~ 27,000 mouse cDNA sequences produced by xxxxxx of the xxxxxx xxxxxx College of Medicine in the  xef xbf xbdmultiple yellow xef xbf xbd design (i.e.: C1C2 C3C4 xxxxxx) described in xxxxxx DA xxxxxx C xxxxxx S xxxxxx Transcriptomic changes in developing kidney exposed to chronic hypoxia. xxxxxxchem xxxxxxphys xxxxxx Commun. 2006 349(1):329-38).	15261
Development of Highly Reproducible and Robust Absorber Coatings for Bolometric Detector Arrays	2017-09-01	2018-07-19	We will develop fabrication processes to realize controlled impedance absorber coatings for bolometric sensor applications.&nbsp; xxxxxxhough there are a variety of different coatings currently employed with existing detector assemblies, they are either difficult to integrate or do not meet the science requirements over envisioned mission lifecycles.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will demonstrate absorbers with highly reproducible and lasting properties applicable for general use in the microwave through the infrared.Our objective is to develop controlled impedance absorbers operating in the mid-to-far infrared spectral band (20 microns and long ward).&nbsp; These absorbers are critical components in a large number of planned terrestrial (e.g., GISMO 2), balloon borne (e.g., BETTII and PIPER), airborne (e.g., HAWC+ and HIRMES), and future space missions.&nbsp; Unfortunately, existing coatings are either difficult to reproduce, incompatible with other sensor processing steps, or susceptible to aging.&nbsp; These attributes result in schedule delays and/or a reduction of science because of a transient optical efficiency over the instrument lifetime.Our near term goal is to develop an absorber material for HIRMES, which requires delivery of flight focal plane arrays prior to&nbsp;April 2017 in order for the instrument&nbsp;build&nbsp;to be completed on schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp; A Nbxxxxxx absorber has been baselined for HIRMES, because xxxxxx Transform xxxxxx measurements of absorber prototypes have shown that this material is resistive at relevant frequency (xxxxxx THz), has a low residual stress (which is required in order to achieve optimal optical coupling), and has a superconducting transition temperature &gt; 10K.&nbsp; This last attribute is important for a background-limited instrument like HIRMES, because the Nbxxxxxx acts like a high pass filter.&nbsp; At frequency &lt; 750GHz, the absorber is invisible, and, consequently, there is significantly lower radiation&nbsp;loading on the detectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will coat the Nbxxxxxx films with ultrathin dielectric coatings in order to passivate them against aging in ambient conditions,&nbsp;and if these films are acceptable, we will have, for the first time, developed broadband coatings that are robust and immune to aging after annealing encountered during detector fabrication and over the course of an instrument development and deployment lifecycle (~years at ambient temperature).	15262

Development of Novel Particle Impact Tester for Oxygen Rich Turbo Machinery Materials and Coating Evaluation	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	The need to develop a test system that can validate material choices in relevant environments is crucial to making robust high performance engine designs, and decrease risk. With this project we propose a ignition test bed capable of providing relevant test conditions (Pressure, Temperature, Velocity, Concentration). A modular subscale oxygen rich preburner based particle impact test system would provide the opportunity to create relevant ox rich environments with various fuels (RP1, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, CNG) with LOX, encompassing the current design envelops of many development projects. A modular design would allow great flexibility not only in environmental the conditions used for testing mixed gas, but also with 100% oxygen testing as well. For example a heat exchanger module could allow for heating LOX, up to high pressure/ high temperature GOX for testing other 100% oxygen engine component candidate materials at conditions that exceed current test capabilities.	15264

Modeling of non-stationary autoregressive alpha-stable processe	2010-09-22	2018-07-19	In the literature, impulsive signals are mostly modeled by symmetric alpha-stable processes. To represent their temporal dependencies, usually autoregressive models with time-invariant coefficients are utilized. We propose a general sequential xxxxxxian modeling methodology where both unknown autoregressive coefficients and distribution parameters can be estimated successfully, even when they are time-varying. In contrast to most work in the literature on signal processing with alpha-stable distributions, our work is general and models also skewed alpha-stable processes. Successful performance of our method is demonstrated by computer simulations. We support our empirical results by providing posterior xxxxxx–Rao lower bounds. The proposed method is also tested on a practical application where seismic data events are modeled.	15267

Precision Hopping/Rolling Robotic Surface Probe Based on Tensegrity Structures	2018-01-01	2018-07-19	We propose to overcome the limitations of wheeled surface rovers by combining recent advances in ball-shaped soft-robots based on tensegrity structures (a tension network of rods and cables), with a hopping mechanism based on cold-gas thrusters. The ball-shaped tensegrity robot with a payload suspended at its center can be collapsed into a small deployment volume, be light-weight, and navigate difficult terrain. In addition to be capable of rolling dynamically (by actuating its cables) and to survive significant landing impact shocks while protecting a delicate payload, we propose to dramatically increase the mobility of this design by adding a simple gas thruster located near the center payload, so that the robot can quickly cover a 1 km distance over a series of hops, while protecting its payload at the center of its structure. Once it has hopped close to its destination, the robot can roll to its exact target. For this concept, we propose to study three technology areas: 1) Mobility - allowing safe and accurate positioning of the robot with a combination of cold-gas thrusters and precision rolling, 2) Perception - placement of sensors to allow for robust navigation, and 3) Autonomy - control algorithms allowing for robust hopping and precision rolling mechanisms that can automatically overcome unexpected obstacles and failures.The innovative tensegrity-based surface probes have much potential in accurately deploying small payloads with speed, robustness and at costs unmatched by today's systems. Tensegrity probes can facilitate an intriguing low-cost exploration mission profile: 1) A tensegrity probe can be squeezed into a small cargo volume then automatically spring away from a base rover; 2) Once released, the tensegrity probe can use a simple gas thruster to make a series of hops towards a final destination. 3) An active tensegrity structure can be used to orient thruster. 4) Compliance of structure allows probe to ``bounce'' on impact, protecting the payload;  5) The probe can then reorient itself from landed position without addition reorientation hardware and efficiently move from landed position to perform sensor measurements and deliver payload; 6) It can survive significant falls and is resistant to being stuck, simplifying route planning and allowing for more aggressive maneuvering and increased autonomy.While tensegrity-based probes have the potential to dramatically increase performance and science return of robotic planetary probes, significant early stage technology development is still needed to enable and evaluate this technology for planetary missions. We propose to develop three key areas to enable this mission concept. These areas will be defined within a reference mission of safely delivering a 1 kg payload a distance of 1 km on the moon.1.xxxxxx thruster and hopping profile to safely deliver payload: The unique tensegrity design offers a number of different ways that the mission goal can be completed. We propose to investigate what thruster hardware will be needed for such a mission to succeed. In addition we will investigate several forms of hopping, ranging from long hops, cushioned by reverse thrusters to many short hops.2.xxxxxx controls needed to orient thruster and navigate effectively: The design of this probe calls for significantly different controls than for a standard gimbaled thruster. Our thruster will be located within the probe and may be partially or fully oriented by changing the shape of the tensegrity. We propose to research how to develop controls that allow successful completion of the reference mission.3.xxxxxx performance using simulation and hardware prototype: For a robot probe to have broad applicability, it will need to handle many challenging terrains, such as hills, and craters. We propose to simulate the tensegrity probe in a number of terrains and simulate its mechanical properties of hardware to show the practicality of this concept.	15269
Core Flight Software (CFS) Maturation Towards Human Rating	2012-09-01	2018-07-19	The research performed under this proposal will assess the applicability of the xxxxxx xxxxxx Software (CFS)  within human-rated type architectures by prototyping and demonstrating its application on a representative set of architectures. This research will identify any additions and changes needed to support such systems. The project will prototype and productize the CFS product addition as necessary to enable broad reuse (part of a multi-year effort).  Specifically, this research addresses the utilization of CFS within architectures typically used on human spacecraft -- those employing a high degree of fault isolation and redundancy.    The CFS framework will be prototyped on quad-redundant voting architectures as well as within a partitioned operating system.The xxxxxx xxxxxx Software (CFS) system developed by xxxxxx, through experience on xxxxxx, has proven to be a quality product and a viable candidate for institutional software reuse on a broad range of xxxxxx spaceflight projects, including in the near term MMSEV, HDU, spacesuits, downmass capsule, and xxxxxx. The productivity and success seen with it can be extrapolated into tremendous savings if applied to human spaceflight software, but diligence needs to be done in assessing its use for large human-rated systems. If deemed viable, the potential exists to reform the state of practice in building human spacecraft software systems by capitalizing upon reuse and realizing a great potential for cost, schedule, and risk reduction.	15270
Additive Manufacturing of Low Work Function Oxides for Spaceborne Thermionic Emission Applications	2021-08-01	2018-07-19	The purpose of this project is to develop an additive manufacturing process for the fabrication a material for use in thermal management of high-speed vehicles, energy conversion, and electric propulsion. To accomplish this objective, the material will be characterized and an additive manufacturing process will be selected and developed, resulting in the creation of a new additive manufacturing machine for ceramic-metal composites. Furthermore, an attempt will be made to synthesize and fabricate the materials through a single-step additive manufacturing process, reducing the manufacturing time of the material. The research is directly aligned with xxxxxx mission to develop novel materials and manufacturing systems for aerospace applications. Furthermore, the applications enabled from the manufacturing of this material will be beneficial to thermal protection, electric propulsion, and energy conversion systems.	15271
NDE Big Data Framework, Phase II	2018-05-01	2018-07-19	NDE data has become ?Big xxxxxx?, and is overwhelming the abilities of NDE technicians and commercially available tools to deal with it. In the current state of the art in industrial practice, there is no integration of the NDE data into design data, NDE models, and structural integrity models for a holistic structural capability assessment. Our proposal responds to these issues described in the subtopic H13.01, xxxxxxanced NDE xxxxxx and xxxxxx. The innovations provided by the NDExxxxxx? are:1.Context-based data browsing and retrieval for diverse sets of large data.2.Automated data analysis / reduction algorithms for aerospace composites.3.xxxxxx fusion algorithms enabling the use of data from design, modeling (NDE and structural), and multiple NDE methods for the improved quantification of defects.4.A plug-in architecture enabling further expansion	15272
Trajectory Design to Benefit Trajectory-Based Surface Operations, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx-based operations constitute a key mechanism considered by the Joint xxxxxxning and xxxxxxment Office (JPDO) for managing traffic in high-density or high-complexity airspace in the Next-xxxxxxration Air Transportation xxxxxx (xxxxxx). With this concept applied to surface operations at major airports, xxxxxx xxxxxx-Airportal Project is exploring the use of surface 4-dimensional (4D) trajectories, which use required times of arrival (RTAs) at selected locations along the route. Observing these RTAs as constraints along the taxi route, the flight still has many degrees of freedom in adjusting its state profiles (i.e.,  position, velocity, etc. as functions of time) to achieve the timing constraints. This research will investigate whether and how these degrees of freedom in trajectory control may be used to achieve desirable behaviors for the taxi operations. Previous research has applied the trajectory control freedom to assure passenger comfort by keeping the accelerations and decelerations within pre-specified limits, and yet there is still untapped flexibility in designing the trajectories. The proposed research will explore this trajectory design problem to achieve additional desirable behaviors, beginning with the consideration of fuel burn, emissions, and noise. A flight-deck automation experimental prototype will provide the platform for simulating the designs. The findings will benefit future designs of flight-deck automation systems, as well as tower automation systems which rely on accurate understanding of the flight deck's operational behaviors to plan efficient and safe operations for the entire surface traffic.	15273

The Cyogenic Evaluation of Irradiated Composite Materials for Use in Composite Pressure Vessels, Phase I	2006-01-01	2018-07-19	The intent of this proposal is to develop key building block technology for lightweight composite structures suitable for cryogenic fuel depot storage as well as human in-space habitat.    The effort will incorporate and expand on previous work by the participants in the cryogenic performance of composite materials as well as improved impact technologies for micro-meteor/space debris survivability.  It will then develop radiation resistant capabilities. In order to develop reliable composite structures for use as cryogenic fuel storage, human habitation, or other mission critical application a solid understanding of constituent material environmental capabilities is required.  While good progress has been made in expanding the knowledge of how composite fibers and matrix systems (resins) react to loads and strains at extremely cold temperatures little to no effort has been made to incorporate radiation exposure such as would be encountered with in-space fuel storage depots.  With a view to developing dual-use lightweight composite structures the proposed effort will develop improved composite material resistance to the harsh radiation environment a spacecraft would be expected to encounter during the life of its mission.  Our intent is to develop robust light weight composite structures which are cryogenic capable as well as impact and radiation resistant.	15275
Distributed Command/Control Impacts on NAS Operations, Phase II	2007-12-01	2018-07-19	In an effort to cope with air traffic demand growths and changing demand patterns, FAA, xxxxxx, and industry have developed a number of simulation tools to model future concepts of air traffic management.   Among these is the xxxxxxs xxxxxx Branch (SAB) simulation environment of xxxxxx xxxxxx.  The current tools would greatly benefit from the portrayal of the daily preemptive Command and Control (C&C) activities performed by FAA and air carrier traffic managers.  These actions significantly influence daily operations and overall NAS efficiency.  xxxxxxment of new operational concepts and evaluation of proposed changes requires simulation and modeling capabilities that include C&C effects.  This understanding is crucial for the evaluation of current or proposed operations.  xxxxxx Aviation uses its extensive experience with and research of C&C to implement a model of NAS-wide xxxxxx (C&C) actions and to integrate the resulting module into xxxxxx xxxxxx's SAB simulation environment.  The final product adds realism to future aircraft movement simulations performed by xxxxxx xxxxxx and admits exploration of new concepts that involve air traffic flow management.	15276

Highly Scalable SiC UV Imager for Earth & Planetary Science, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	Commercial silicon carbide (xxxxxx)-based photonic sensors typically use p&#150;i&#150;n photodiode and reversed-biased xxxxxx (APD) detectors. These state-of-the-art xxxxxx photodioides use the wafer substrate as one node of the device, thereby making monolithic integration of the device with control or analysis circuitry difficult, if not impossible.xxxxxx new (patent pending) photo detecting devices are inherently suitable for integration in xxxxxx-based low-voltage integrated circuit processes. By virtue of their construction, the photo-generation occurs efficiently and with very high gain. This proposal uses these high-gain photonic devices to construct the world's first monolithic xxxxxx UV pixel sensor array. Also key to this proposal is xxxxxx extensive library of xxxxxx analog and mixed-signal IP and its expertise in extreme environment IC design.	15278
Highly Reliable Structural Health Monitoring of Smart Composite Vanes for Jet Engine, Phase I	2011-01-01	2018-07-19	Intelligent xxxxxx xxxxxxic xxxxxxs and Auburn xxxxxxersity propose a xxxxxx xxxxxx Grating (FBG) integrated xxxxxx (SHM) sensor system capable of providing in-situ crack detection, location and quantification of damage, as well as validating structural models, using recent advances in non-contact, non-destructive dynamic testing of composite structures. The key innovation is an FBG-based SHM system for detecting, locating and quantifying crack and de-lamination in composite structures such as smart, composite jet engine vanes with embedded FBG sensor systems. These new techniques make it possible to analyze complex structures not only non-destructively, but also without physically contacting or implanting electrical elements into test samples. The state-of-art FBG sensor system will be capable of measuring strains, stress, temperature and pressure and monitor damage to the structure under test at the same time at wide temperature ranges. IFOS and its university research collaborator will investigate the feasibility of such multi-functional FBG sensors with great potential for SHM. xxxxxxanced signal processing, system identification and damage identification, location and quantification algorithms will be applied. Potentially, the solution could evolve into an autonomous onboard monitoring system to inspect and perform Non-Destructive Evaluation and SHM.	15279

MOIDSS?- Mobile Online Intelligent Decision Support System, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	A mapping solution will be developed that allows for geospatial-reality intelligent linking database with remotely sensed images.  This system is designed to use xxxxxx datasets to support xxxxxx Center Operations.   Mobile xxxxxx Intelligent Decision Support xxxxxxs (MOIDSS?) can be deployed in a variety of xxxxxx facilities and commercial industry facilities.  This solution will support a range of technologies, such as, handheld field computers, Real-time Kinematic xxxxxx Positioning xxxxxxs (RTK-GPS), and wireless networking systems.  This solution will utilize current of the shelf (COTS) technology, which is presently integrated in the xxxxxx facilities.  Commercial software will be developed for automated data collection and validation of spatial information.   The innovative technology and theory will enable fusion of data in situ by using the geospatial-reality intelligent linking database (GRILD).  This solution can be used by emergency response management teams, homeland security groups, and engineering staff to make vital decisions with all available spatial data. The goal of this project was to develop an innovative idea using advance methods and technologies to help xxxxxx xxxxxx and Center Operation directorates.  xxxxxx xxxxxxearch xxxxxxovation Design (xxxxxx) proposes and supports this xxxxxx.	15281
Advanced Bayesian Methods for Lunar Surface Navigation, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	The key innovation of this project will be the application of advanced xxxxxxian methods to integrate real-time dense stereo vision and high-speed optical flow with an Inertial Measurement xxxxxx (IMU) to produce a highly accurate planetary rover navigation system. The software developed in this project will leverage current computing technology to implement advanced xxxxxx Odometry (VO) methods that will accurately track much faster rover movements. Our fully xxxxxxian approach to VO will utilize more information from the images than previous methods are capable of using. Our xxxxxxian VO does not explicitly select features to track. Instead it implicitly determines what can be learned from each image pixel and weights the information accordingly. This means that our approach can work with images that have no distinct corners, which can be a significant advantage with low contrast images from permanently shadowed areas. We expect that the error characteristics of the visual processing with be complementary to the error characteristics of a low-cost IMU. Therefore, the combination of the two should provide highly accurate navigation.	15282

GIOTTO ION MASS SPECTROMETER HIGH ENERGY RANGE DATA V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	A wide range of ion species and velocity distributions are expected to be found as the xxxxxx spacecraft traverses the coma of xxxxxx's Comet. The outer coma is characterized by the interaction between solar wind and cometary plasmas, the inner coma by the outflow of cometary neutrals and their ionization products. The resultant demands on instrument dynamic range preclude use of a single sensor for measurements of ion composition. The xxxxxx Ion xxxxxx xxxxxx (IMS) therefore consists of two sensors: one optimized for the outer and the other for the inner coma, with each obtaining complementary information in the region for which it is not optimized. Both sensors feature mass imaging characteristics, thereby permitting simultaneous measurements of several ion species by means of multi-detector arrays. The prime objective of the High-Energy xxxxxx xxxxxx (HERS) is to measure the ion abundances and three-dimensional velocity distributions outside the cometary contact surface.	15284
LRO MOON LAMP 2 EXPERIMENT DATA RECORD V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	xxxxxx (LRO) xxxxxx Alpha xxxxxx Project (LAMP) CODMAC xxxxxx Experiment xxxxxx Record is a collection of the far ultraviolet photon detections obtained by the LAMP instrument, in raw form. As such, it constitutes the permanent record of the raw LAMP data. These data include both the instrument science and housekeeping data, organized into extensions within files formatted according to the Flexible Image Transport xxxxxx (FITS) standard, version 2.1b. The LAMP EDR archive enables reprocessing of the raw science data as radiometric and geometric calibration processing routines improve. Investigators interested in applying advanced calibration methods or needing to understand the properties of the raw data will find the EDR products useful. Most investigators, however, will be interested in using either the LAMP data products contained in the CODMAC xxxxxx 3 xxxxxxd xxxxxx Record, as radiometric and geometric calibration processing has already been done for these products, or the LAMP CODMAC xxxxxx 5 far ultraviolet map products.	15285

This instrument measures the intensities of in-situ charged particles ( >15 keV electrons and >30 keV ions) with various levels of discrimination based on energy range and mass species. A subset of almost 100 LECP channels are included in this data set. The LECP data are globally calibrated to the extent possible.  xxxxxx include electrons, protons, alpha particles, and light, medium, and heavy nuclei particles.	15286
Towards More Efficient Comprehensive Rotor Noise Simulation, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Rotorcraft design and optimization currently still rely largely on simplified (low-fidelity) models, such as rotor disk or wake models to reduce the turn-around time and allow exploration of a large parameter space. On the other hand, accurate noise prediction requires first principle, high fidelity simulations to capture small scales, highly unsteady aerodynamic sources of noise. This forces us to resort to component-wise acoustics computations, ignoring the fact that different components in the system affect each other in generating noise.The objective of this proposal is to develop high fidelity rotor noise simulation capabilities that allow multi-components noise prediction and exploration of a large parameter space  inherent to design processes. The distinctive aspect of the present proposal is the use of a novel discretization method based on xxxxxxive Vorticity Confinement technique to counteract the numerical dissipation of the underlying spatial discretization scheme in a dynamic fashion. The concept has been proven successful in controlled flow setting, allowing direct comparison with analytical solution and laboratory experiment. The primary task in this project is to extend this concept to general flow and computational environment, focusing on Blade-xxxxxx Interaction noise prediction as initially targeted milestone.	15287
Low Temperature, High Energy Density Micro Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cell, Phase I	2012-08-01	2018-07-19	A new type of solid oxide fuel cell based on thin film technology and ultra-thin electrolyte is being proposed to develop to realize major reductions in fuel cell size, weight, and operating temperature, while significantly increasing power density. The thin film fuel cell is comprised of a micro-thin electrolyte (thickness ~ 1µm) that is grown on a foil nickel substrate.	15288
Configurable, Multi-Beam, Doppler Ladar Based Precision Landing Sensor, Phase I	2016-06-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx proposes a configurable, multi-beam, 1.5 um xxxxxx sensor, enabled by high-speed non-mechanical beam steering (NMBS). NMBS uses state-of-the-art, high-speed liquid-crystal based components, to provide wide-angle (up to +/- 45 degree), large-aperture, optical beam steering, at speeds of up to 10 kHz. Furthermore, this is integrated into a very compact optical transmit/receive terminal, designed for coherent lidar operation. The proposed xxxxxx sensor is estimated to be 4X lower SWaP, and have 3X-5X improved range performance over the current design for entry, descent, landing (EDL) sensors under development at xxxxxx. In addition, the configurable, high-speed, beam-scan pattern provides enhanced functionality for velocity/range/attitude estimate, and even for terrain mapping. The xxxxxx landing sensor model will be developed by our xxxxxxearch xxxxxx partner, leveraging their related work on 3D-imaging ladar.The proposed effort targets a space-qualifiable roadmap, as we will leverage ongoing inter-disciplinary engineering development and qualification at xxxxxx, for high-reliability, high-power, fiber laser transmitter and transmit/receive optical terminal for deep-space mission.	15289
Deformable Mirror for Spaceflight	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	The specific objective of this IRAD is adapting a precision glass slumping technology that GSFC has developed for making grazing incidence mirrors for making normal incidence mirrors. These mirrors, extremely thin (0.2mm) and lightweight (0.5 kg/m2), will be sent to Dr. xxxxxx at JPL and colleagues at Caltech who will attach precision actuation mechanisms on their backs to adjust their focus and other characteristics, making them fully diffraction-limited at 500nm wavelength. The requirements on the mirror substrate are: They must be no more than 0.2mm thick, because of both a desire to have a lightweight mirror and the fact that the actuation mechanism has a very limited dynamic range, which is inversely proportional to mirror substrate thickness. They must be diffraction-limited at all but the lowest spatial frequencies. In practice, this means that any deviation from the mathematic prescription must be well below 20 nm. This is because the actuation mechanism is not effective in removing errors with spatial periods shorter than about 20mm.	15290

Efficient High Power 2 micron Tm3+-Doped Fiber Laser, Phase II	2006-11-01	2018-07-19	This proposal is for the development of new Tm3+ doped germanate glass fibers for efficient high power 2-micron fiber lasers capable of generating an output power of up to hundreds watts.  We propose to use Tm3+ doped germanate glass fibers because silica glass fiber is not the ideal host for lasers at wavelength of 2-micron and longer. Germanate glass exhibits lower phonon energy compared to silica glass, increasing the quantum efficiency of 3F4 level of Tm3+ ions. Importantly, Tm3+ can be highly doped into germanate glasses, which results in so called cross-relaxation, dramatically improving the quantum efficiency. We will develop double-clad single mode germanate glass fibers with greater than 6wt% Tm3+ concentration to take full advantages of this Tm3+ cross-relaxation process, developing highly efficient fiber lasers at 2-micron. This type of fiber laser is useful for LIDAR applications, can also be used to pump Ho3+ doped crystals to generate extremely high power 2-micron lasers.	15292
Advanced Propeller Flow Control for Increased Propulsive Efficiency, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	An important mission for xxxxxx is the development of revolutionary flight concepts and technology.  The development of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), the resurgence of general aviation, and growing interest in environmentally conscious, all-electric, emissionless aircraft have brought about a renewed interest in propeller design.  Overall, since the propeller's golden age during the WWII era, very little has changed in propeller design.  Computers have automated the design processes, but the basic design methodology, from an aerodynamic point of view has changed very little.  xxxxxx have been made in acoustics and multidisciplinary optimization (MDO), but the basic aerodynamic design and performance of the subsonic propeller has basically remained unchanged.  The explosion of UAVs and a need for more efficient designs allowing greater payload, range, and loiter times have taken UAVs from simple cut-and-try designs to sophisticated, aerodynamically efficient systems.  An area as of yet not fully exploited by this class of aircraft, is that of propeller efficiency.  Most smaller UAVs and xxxxxxs simply use off-the-shelf radio control propellers, while moderate size UAVs rely on propellers designed using classical blade element theory or those derived for general aviation aircraft.  While these propellers provide industry acceptable levels of thrust for a given torque, the majority of propellers suffer some form of flow separation.  The extent of flow separation can range from small areas in cruise regions of the flight envelope, to large areas during climb and wind milling.  Significant propeller performance gains in the form of increased thrust and reduced torque can be obtained by eliminating these separated regions across the flight envelope.  A simple, efficient, and robust flow control technique is proposed to eliminate these separated regions and provide a marked increase in propeller performance and vehicle propulsive performance.	15293

1 Gb Radiation Hardened Nonvolatile Memory Development, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	The objective of this effort is to identify, characterize and develop advanced semiconductor materials and fabrication process techniques, and design and produce a xxxxxx (GB)-scale high density, radiation hardened (RH), SONOS-based nonvolatile memory (NVM) in a standard, high density CMOS technology with feature sizes approaching the 90nm technology node.  xxxxxx reliable, RH SWAP-efficient, high-density NVM provides for the deployment of more capable, flexible and responsive hardware designs leading to improved mission performance and enhanced data storage capability with less system operational complexity and reduced system vulnerability to natural and weapons generated radiation environments.  By leveraging state-of-the-art (SOA) commercial NVM technologies and implementing a combination of these elements with the proper memory cell architecture, radiation hardened device design, and advanced fabrication processes, we are confident we can produce a 1Gb RH NVM using currently available CMOS process modules at or below the 90 nm fabrication technology node.  The unique materials and process technologies to be investigated in our approach include composite high-k dielectric thin-film oxide materials, shallow trench isolation, atomic layer deposition, p-channel silicon-insulator-nitride-oxide-silicon (xxxxxx) NVM architecture, and RH CMOS peripheral circuitry.	15295
Uncertainty Quantification for Production Navier-Stokes Solvers, Phase II	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	The uncertainty quantification methods developed under this program are designed for use with current state-of-the-art flow solvers developed by and in use at xxxxxx.  The xxxxxx I program demonstrated the CRISP CFDREG error quantification and reduction code with simulations conducted using the xxxxxx unstructured solvers xxxxxx and USM3D.  xxxxxx I provided evidence supporting the suspected need for an error prediction code that matches the finite volume scheme of xxxxxx solver itself.  xxxxxx will continue this work by expanding our xxxxxx Transport Equation (ETE) solver to treat both classes of unstructured grid finite volume schemes.  Support for the CGNS standard will be implemented and permit use of the xxxxxx product by a broader spectrum of potential users.  Specific issues that affect numerical accuracy of the error predictions and how they propagate into integrated quantities such as lift and drag coefficients will be addressed.  Reduction of error for large scale meshes is a matter of equal importance, and improvements are planned that will provide for anisotropic grid refinement within the existing CRISP CFDREG mesh adaptation code.  Finally, error quantification approaches for transient applications will be explored to expand these developments to problems that involve inherent unsteadiness and/or moving boundaries.	15296

Spacecraft Thermal Control System Not Requiring Power, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The thermal management of spacecraft would be enhanced by dynamic control over surface emissivity in the mid-infrared. In this xxxxxx program, xxxxxx xxxxxxs proposes to demonstrate a flexible film material whose emissivity self-switches from a low value to a high value when the film temperature exceeds a preset value. The wavelength of peak emissivity can be engineered between 1.5 to 15 ?m as desired, and the transition temperature can be varied between 5-70 C. The film is easily engineered for different requirements, and if desired, different film characteristics could even be applied to different areas of the same spacecraft. No external power is required. The film substrate is a light weight flexible material that can be produced in large areas by roll-to-roll nanoimprinting.  xxxxxx xxxxxxs has substantial background in the computational design and fabrication of these types of switchable emissivity materials. In addition to xxxxxx applications, the material will serve military needs such as IR signature control for ships, aircraft, UAVs or land vehicles,  commercial needs in  thermo-photovoltaics, and for energy efficiency in residential and commercial architectural uses for walls, roofs and windows.	15298
Very Dense High Speed 3u VPX Memory and Processing Space Systems, Phase II	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	While VPX shows promise as an open standard COTS computing and memory platform, there are several challenges that must be overcome to migrate the technology for a space application.  For the xxxxxx I xxxxxx, SEAKR investigated the 3u VPX architecture for the space environment for advanced memory and processing systems.

The areas of innovation that have been addressed are outlined below:xxxxxxearch and evaluate the basic building blocks required for a high speed switch VPX architectureExplore advanced EDAC and innovative wear leveling techniques for commercially upscreened flash memory for space applicationsEvaluate different techniques for very high speed flash memory access xxxxxx will build on the xxxxxx I study to produce a deliverable engineering model of a 3U VPX flash memory module.	15299
Piezoelectric MEMS Microphones for Ground Testing of Aeronautical Systems, Phase II	2013-12-01	2018-07-19	Improving the acoustical environment is critical in aeronautics. Airports and aeronautical systems manufacturers are facing ever-increasing demands to reduce noise levels.  xxxxxx applications require the use of high quality microphones with a large dynamic range, sometimes in large arrays.  These arrays are expensive.  The advent of lower cost microphones that meet the users' specifications would dramatically improve the ability of engineers seeking to quantify the acoustic impact of either their designs or their facilities (e.g., airports) and to make data driven decisions to improve any adverse situation. In our xxxxxx-I xxxxxx, we showed the technical feasibility of a commercially viable, piezoelectric micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) microphones capable of withstanding adverse conditions found in ground testing of the acoustics of aeronautical systems. In the xxxxxx project, we will implement design changes to improve these sensors.  We will develop efficient deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) procedures to increase our yield and lower costs.  We will develop scalable packaging techniques so that the devices can be economically assembled into a completed device.  Finally, the reliability and robustness of these microphones will be determined.

(CRG) proposes to design and develop thermally-reversible polymeric materials that will function to modify the reprocessing characteristics of current packaging plastics to provide compatibility to xxxxxx Deposition xxxxxx (FDM) type 3-D printing.  The application of thermally-reversible polymers combined with a plastic recycling, blending, and extrusion process would allow current and future packaging materials to be processed into a copolymer blend filament suited to the 3-D printing system.  This will provide xxxxxx with a means to generate 3-D printer feedstock from on-hand packaging plastics without the need for separate 3-D printer raw material payloads.  CRG has already demonstrated the efficacy of thermally-reversible bond structures in commercial adhesive applications, and the proposed concept not only has the potential to enable reclamation and 3-D printing from currently employed packaging materials, but to advance the state-of-the-art in 3-D printing materials technology.  CRG's proposed approach to develop thermally-reversible polymer materials to modify current packaging solutions, and demonstration of recycling of those packaging materials into a 3-D printable filament, will provide xxxxxx with a material and processing technology readiness level (xxxxxx) of 3 at the conclusion of the xxxxxx I effort.	15301

Probabilistic Analysis of Renal Stones in US Astronauts (PI=Kassemi)	2015-05-01	2018-07-19	A combined transport-kinetics model for nucleation, growth, and agglomeration of calcium oxalate crystals was developed in the framework of the population balance equation whereupon the nephron was treated as a continuous crystallizer. The model was used to investigate the growth rates and size distributions of renal calculi based on parametric simulation case studies for normal and stone-forming subjects in 1g and microgravity. To investigate the transport effects of gravity on the formation and development of renal calculi in the nephron, the Population Balance Equation (PBE)-agglomeration model was further incorporated into the multipurpose computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code Ansys-Fluent and coupled to xxxxxx and species equations that describe the urinary flow and transport of calcium and oxalate ions through the nephron.          Numerical results indicate that the typical renal biochemistry of normal subjects on Earth as exemplified by low urinary calcium and oxalate concentrations, higher relative velocities between urinary flow and the calculi, and lower reaction rates due to presence of normal concentration of inhibitors will lead to surface reaction limited crystal growth rates. xxxxxxver, in microgravity, due to the possibility of increased supersaturation levels arising from lower urine volumes and higher calcium and oxalate concentrations, a negligible relative velocity between the stone and the urinary flow, and the lower inhibitor concentrations, the stone growth will be limited by the transport of ions in the bulk liquid. The numerical simulations further indicate that:     1. The distribution of stone sizes and their respective population densities are both quite sensitive to the different biochemistries of normal and stone-forming subjects in 1g and microgravity.     2.Stone formers exhibit parabolic distributions with peak of stone populations shifting from 2 microns in 1g to about 5-7 microns in reduced-gravity and when precipitation is the main mechanism for growth.     3.Normal subjects exhibit a monotonic decrease in precipitating stone size populations from seed size to about 8 microns in microgravity.    4. As a result of the shift in the renal biochemistry upon exposure to microgravity, a normal subject in space can exhibit stone growth rates and size distributions that are comparable to a stone-former on Earth -- a finding that may prove important to the astronaut screening protocols.    5.Agglomeration is likely to be the most important and critical mechanism in development and enlargement of renal stones causing around ten-fold increase in the resulting stone sizes.    6.Stone size distribution is quite sensitive to the magnitude of the agglomeration coefficient – a quantity that unfortunately may vary substantially for different urine biochemistries and therefore not well-quantified in published literature.     7.The gravitational field plays an adverse effect increasing the transit time of renal calculi in the nephron with a possibility of a nearly two-fold stone size enhancement.     In summary, the results so far imply that while a typical stone-former may form considerably larger renal stones on Earth, the normal subject in microgravity tends to make significantly more stones below the 2 micron range by nucleation and precipitation. Agglomeration of these crystals in the nephron may result in a 10 fold further increase in the stone sizes in microgravity. The stones in this size range will still clear through the nephron. But unfortunately, upon re-entry into a gravitational field, further growth and agglomeration of the renal calculi combined with increased transit times due to the lagging of the stones behind the urinary flow in tubule sections where gravitational vector is acting in the adverse direction can result in size increases alarmingly close to the critical dimension for retention. In this case, the risk for a clinical stone occurrence may be greatly enhanced.     The development of the Renal Stone xxxxxxion Simulation xxxxxx (RSFSM) and its validation has been nearly completed in 2013. In the final year of the project (2014), this model will be used to perform a series of comprehensive parametric simulation case studies to investigate effect of hydration and inhibition. Furthermore, the core deterministic PBE model will be coupled to front and back end probabilistic wrapper models. Simulations performed using the combined deterministic-probabilistic model will be used to provide a probabilistic assessment of the risks of clinical stone incidents for future space mission scenarios.	15309

Nanostructures for Advanced Imaging and Detector Devices	2013-09-01	2018-07-19	GSFC has successfully demonstrated significant progress in developing carbon nanotubes for many space applications, especially extreme stray light suppression. xxxxxxgraphy is among the most challenging applications, and the most challenging (but necessary) form is a 3-dimensional coronagraphic baffle.  In this IRAD we will build a solar baffle and address difficult technical barriers, namely catalyst deposition and uniform growth on a complex tube used for a novel compact coronagraph.  This is enabling technology for all other science applications both imaging and non-imaging.We have developed carbon nanotube formulations primarily geared towards enhanced stray light control on a variety of instruments.  IRAD has supported development of this technology to make it 10 to 100 times blacker than alternate surface treatments from the Near UV to xxxxxx and a large variety of substrates suitable for space flight instrumentation.   In addition, we have performed the first growth on catalyst applied to substrates using xxxxxx (ALD).  xxxxxx is normally deposited using thermal or e-beam evaporation which allows for coating flat surfaces.  Many baffles are dimensional, curved or complex, requiring conformal deposition.  The development of a conformal nanotube process is enabling to many applications.  We have demonstrated ALD of iron catalyst out of house and hope to achieve an in-house capability.  Ellipsometry performed on the part verified sub nanometer uniformity of catalyst across a test part .  The compact coronagraph baffle is larger and more complex which will pose a significant challenge in maintaining uniformity over a larger third dimension.   In addition, we must solve the problem of managing feedstock gas flow in our nanotube furnace during chemical vapor deposition (CVD).  We have seen significant shadowing and non uniformity of growth due to laminar flow at substrate edges.  xxxxxx of the gas flow has begun and will be useful in solving this problem.  In addition we are performing our occulter growth using a reflector to direct feedstock gas to the shadowed side of the mask.  Our goal will be to address these challenges and deliver a solar chronographic mask that is applicable to other scientific observations.	15312
Efficient Radiation Shielding Through Direct Metal Laser Sintering	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	We have developed a method for efficient component-level radiation shielding that can be printed by direct metal laser sintering (xxxxxx) from files generated by the commercial xxxxxx particle transport code, NOVICE, modified for this purpose.&nbsp; The development of techniques for 3-D printing of otherwise difficult-to-fabricate shielding designs will reduce infusion risk of new electronics technology by providing a mass- and cost-efficient, effective mitigation of risks due to total ionizing dose. This component-level spot shielding technology readiness level is being raised through mechanical, thermal, and vibration testing and analysis of the complete shield-component-printed circuit board (PCB) system. Functional and parametric degradation of microcircuits due to total ionizing dose (TID) often pose serious obstacles to deployment of critical state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies in xxxxxx missions. Shielding to the electronics box is used to mitigate TID degradation. Shielding materials can add significant amounts of mass to a system.&nbsp; One method for reducing mass is to apply &ldquo;spot&rdquo; shielding located only on the critical components that require it. Board area is often a constraint for spot shield design.&nbsp; 3-D printing technology offers promising breakthroughs in the design and deployment of radiation shielding optimized to the capability of the component, the mission radiation environment, and the shielding already provided by the component&rsquo;s surroundings. Shields can be designed based upon the individualized package features to minimize area yet better protect from the omnidirectional radiation environment; such hand-and-glove fits would otherwise require complex machining.Shield design is accomplished by the commercially-available NOVICE code.&nbsp; NOVICE radiation attenuation calculations use the code&rsquo;s ray-trace procedure in conjunction with 1-D attenuation data scaled for the different attenuation properties of the materials. A 3-D adjoint xxxxxx simulation verifies shielding effectiveness. NOVICE then generates the .STL CAD file for direct importation into a xxxxxx system.We have demonstrated successful development, fabrication, and mass-savings of a xxxxxx additive-manufactured component-level prototype shield. The prototype shield was assembled to a PCB-mounted operational amplifier as a proof-of-concept and for xxxxxx functional evaluation necessary to bring this technology to xxxxxx-6.&nbsp; xxxxxx efforts focus on environmental (vibration, thermal-vacuum) testing of the shield-component-PCB system.&nbsp; Additional goals include demonstration of reliable xxxxxx-printed shield design and fit across package types, and assessment of the manufacturing quality of the xxxxxx-printed shields across multiple manufacturers and materials.	15313
Flow Boiling and Condensation in Microgravity	2019-08-01	2018-07-19	Due to its potential to improve system performance while reducing mass, space programs worldwide are considering the implementation of two-phase thermal management systems. By capitalizing on a fluid's latent heat as well as sensible, two-phase systems can offer vast improvements in both heat acquisition and rejection compared to their traditional single-phase counterparts. Before these systems can be implemented, however, an increase in both the quantity and quality of available design tools is necessary. These tools are critical for determining heat transfer coefficients, pressure drop, and critical heat flux (CHF) in flow boiling, all of which are integral to the design of thermal control systems. In particular, the impact of the different gravitational fields commonly seen in spaceflight on these defining characteristics isn't well understood. Many existing models show poor results when applied in microgravity, displaying the need for new predictive tools that can accurately capture system behavior in a broad range of gravitational environments. The proposed study will utilize the xxxxxx xxxxxxersity Boiling and Two-xxxxxx Flow xxxxxx's (PU-BxxxxxxL's) flow boiling and condensation rig, which can be operated both on the ground and in parabolic flight. By controlling the angle of descent, parabolic flights can be used to simulate a range of gravitational fields, including microgravity, xxxxxx gravity, and xxxxxx gravity. In addition to gathering heat transfer data, flow visualization techniques will be employed to help capture and classify the different flow regimes encountered. These regimes have been shown to depend greatly on flow orientation for boiling and condensation, as well as heater orientation for flow boiling. These factors are again expected to play an important role in microgravity. The data gathered in different gravitational fields will be used to develop mechanistic models and advanced computational methods. These tools can then be applied to the design of advanced thermal management systems for space systems, helping to make the next generation of spacecraft both lighter and capable of handling devices with higher energy density than is currently possible. The technology developed by this study will primarily benefit xxxxxx Technical Area (TA) 14, Thermal Management xxxxxxs. Specifically, TA-14.2, Thermal Control xxxxxxs, will see the greatest impact from this work. Because thermal control systems are integral components of so many different technologies, however, the work will also impact the development of more than half of the other specified technical areas (as shown in fig. 6 of xxxxxx TA-14 document). Because of this potential to greatly influence the design of a broad range of technologies, the work done in this study towards the development of two-phase thermal control systems will have a significant impact on all future space missions.	15314

Intelliface - Intelligent Assistant for Interfacing Diagnosis and Planning Systems, Phase II	2014-08-01	2018-07-19	To integrate automated diagnosis and automated planning functions, one must translate diagnosed system faults to corresponding changes in resource availabilities.  Implementing reliable translation is challenging, time-consuming, and error prone.We propose to develop Intelliface, an intelligent tool for developing interfaces between diagnosis and planning systems.

Chip-Scale Precision Timing Unit for PicoSatellites	2016-10-01	2018-07-19	This project intends to develop a chip-scale timing unit that offers an order of magnitude higher performance compared to existing solutions. Current Quartz-based clocks are not ideally suited to the high temperatures and extreme acceleration typical of space applications. The chip-scale precision clocks developed under this research offer reduced thermal sensitivity, and susceptibility to shock and acceleration using an array of micro-mechanical resonators with different temperature coefficient of frequencies. The resonators are passively compensated in a broad temperature range and offer a high quality factor and a small motional impedance, all characteristics required for achieving low-phase noise and low-power clocks. The resonators are placed in an array, and the frequency is estimated based on the weighted average output of the resonators with an accuracy that is at least an order of magnitude better than that of a single resonator clock. This research results in more precise mechanical clocks operating in space, thus can significantly impact xxxxxx autonomous platforms by enabling more precise landing and autonomous rendezvous.	15327

Algorithms and their Impact on Integrated Vehicle Health Management - Chapter 7	2013-03-20	2018-07-19	This chapter discussed some of the algorithmic choices one encounters when designing an IVHM system. While it would be generally desirable to be able to pick a particular set of algorithms for a particular problem, the reality is a bit more complex. xxxxxx on the budget, the performance requirements, the computational constraints, sensor availability, access to historical data, operational and environmental conditions, robustness to changing system configurations, algorithm maintenance needs, etc., no one algorithm will perform best in all situations. Indeed, it is necessary to evaluate these constraints during the algorithm design process and determine the best choice on a case-by-case analysis. The trade-offs between different choices are very real, and sometimes no solution can be found, which means that some of the constraints have to be relaxed. The simplest solution is generally preferred over a more complex one, but it is also important to consider that there is no free lunch. Finally, any health management solution also has to undergo verification and validation (xxxxxx) and, in some cases, certification. Some of these issues are topics of other chapters in this book.	15332
Continuation Methods and Non-Linear/Non-Gaussian Estimation for Flight Dynamics, Phase II	2013-05-01	2018-07-19	We propose herein to augment current xxxxxx spaceflight dynamics programs with algorithms and software from three domains.  First, we use parameter continuation methods to assist in computation of trajectories in complicated dynamical situations.  Numerical parameter continuation methods have been used extensively to compute a menagerie of structures in dynamical systems including fixed points, periodic orbits, simple bifurcations and invariant manifolds.  Perhaps more important for the current work, such methods have already proven their worth in flight dynamics problems, especially those having to do with the complicated dynamics near libration points.  xxxxxxond, we propose to use Continuous Mechanics and xxxxxximal Control (CMOC).   xxxxxx based the CMOC formalism promises to support optimal trajectory design using both discrete and continuous control.  Third, we propose to use advanced filtering techniques and representations of probability density functions to appropriately compute and manage the uncertainty in the trajectories. While advanced methods for understanding and leveraging the underlying dynamics are clearly necessary for effective mission design, planning, and analysis, we contend that they do not suffice.  In particular, they do not, in and of themselves, address the issue of uncertainty.xxxxxx we discuss methods that balance the accuracy of the uncertainty representation against computational tractability.	15333

The First JFET-based Silicon Carbide Active Pixel Sensor UV Imager, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxar-blind ultraviolet (UV) imaging is critically important in the fields of space astronomy, national defense, and bio-chemistry. xxxxxxed xxxxxx Carbide, xxxxxx. proposes to develop and commercialize a unique xxxxxx-based monolithically-integrated radiation-tolerant solar blind active pixel sensor (APS) UV imager.  xxxxxx carbide is the ideal materials system due to its negligible dark currents, excellent radiation tolerance, intrinsic insensitivity to visible and near IR light, and technological maturity.  The xxxxxx carbide xxxxxx is an ideal choice as an IC building block, as it is immune to the presence of stacking faults in wafer material and is free from possible threshold voltage drifting associated with the xxxxxx MOSFET.The proposed PiN and Lxxxxxx based APS circuitry has the potential for reliable operation at temperatures exceeding 150 C.  The proposed design of the active pixel sensor can be adopted for detection of more energetic particles, such as EUV and soft-X-ray, by increasing the thickness of the active low doped layer. Such APS detector arrays could be custom designed, including pixel size and epilayer thickness, and would be of nearly UNIVERxxxxxx USE in nuclear particle detection and spectroscopy. While the active pixel sensor market is niche, applications in related xxxxxx Carbide Lxxxxxx based analog processes offering temperature operation above 200 C have tremendous value in the commercial, industrial & high temperature market space.  Lxxxxxx IC building blocks such as voltage references, oscillators, comparators and regulators form the cell circuits for such products as PWM controllers, power transistor gate drivers, voltage regulators and amplifiers.	15337

An On-Chip Nano-Plasmonics Based Urine Protein Assay Cartridge, Phase I	2009-02-01	2018-07-19	Long-term exposure to microgravity and radiation during space exploration can pose a critical threat to the health of a flight crew. Real-time monitoring of urine protein levels is an effective way to follow the onset and progress of many diseases and guide the prompt selection of proper therapy. The success of such diagnostic tasks, which is strongly desired for flight missions, critically depends upon the degree of automation and reliability of such trace level detection. To meet this need, we propose to develop a novel on-chip, nano-plasmonic sensor cartridge to concurrently quantify the presence of different urine proteins. The envisioned device is compact, lightweight, fully integrated and automated, and highly cost- and power-effective. The program objectives will be accomplished via several innovations: (a) a new nano-plasmonics chip technology-based SPR sensor that is compatible with miniaturization, (b) tailored array modifications, allowing for concurrent screening of multiple proteins, (c) microfluidic platform for automated biochemical processes, and (d) simulation-based design for rapid prototype development. In xxxxxx I, we will develop and demonstrate the critical microfluidic components (i.e., filter, mixer and network architecture) guided by physics-based simulations, and experimentally demonstrate the two-type-assay on a single nanoplasmonics chip for protein detection. The simulation-based design will conform to specifications that are amenable to mass-production-friendly lithographic techniques. In xxxxxx, the nano-plasmonic sensor will be optimized to increase sensitivity, stability, and the response to regular urine samples. Finally, the sensor will be integrated with microfluidic components and control/transmission electronics to form a portable protein assay cartridge.	15340
Enhanced Mesh-Free Simulation of Regolith Flow, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx needs simulation tools capable of predicting the behavior of regolith in proposed excavation, transport, and handling or sample acquisition systems. For engineering-scale problems FE analyses utilizing soil-mechanics-based constitutive models have long been utilized in civil engineering to evaluate stresses and deformations up to failure, even including some plastic flow. The extremely large strains, bulking and recompaction behavior in excavation, hopper flow and regolith processing, however, are generally beyond the capability of most FE codes. xxxxxx-free methods offer an attractive option -- especially when coupled with critical-state soil-mechanics based constitutive models allowing unlimited shear deformation and flow. This xxxxxx-1 project will enhance a new mesh-free SPH-based simulation model, initiated as part of an earlier xxxxxx project, to demonstrate its potential to meet xxxxxx need for a robust simulation tool for regolith manipulation and flow. Enhancements include providing smooth transitions as new free surfaces are created, parallelized algorithms so that high resolution can be maintained as the physical scale of the problems is increased to realistic engineering sizes, and inclusion of realistic cohesion in the critical-state soil-mechanics constitutive model. The large fraction of very fine particulates in lunar and xxxxxx regoliths (e.g., particles < 20-microns) precludes particle-scale DEM models from ever being able to both maintain particle-scale fidelity and simulate engineering-scale problems. Utilization of larger-than-nature 'calculational particles' in DEM code leads to new challenges -- calibration of those 'particles' so that the calculational material will reproduce the constitutive behavior of the original granular assembly. The mesh-free SPH model developed here has the potential to become a new robust simulation tool to address xxxxxx challenging regolith manipulation and flow problems.	15341
High Performance Wafer-Based Capillary Electrochromatography, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	Los Gatos xxxxxxearch proposes to develop wafer-based capillary electrochromatography for lab-on-a-chip (LOC) applications.  These microfluidic devices will be engineered for integration with chemical and biomolecular LOC detector systems.  For xxxxxx I, a chip-based capillary electrochromatography system will be constructed and tested.  The xxxxxx I xxxxxxearch will address issues related to the performance of, as well as production methods that can be used for the technology. An integrated microfluidic system will be designed, and specifications for the xxxxxx Prototype will be determined.  The suitability of the technology for present xxxxxx LOC applications will be assessed, and relevant commercial markets and products will be identified.  Commercial devices based on the xxxxxx prototype will be constructed and commercialized during xxxxxx.	15342
Open-Source Pipeline for Large-Scale Data Processing, Analysis and Collaboration, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx observational and modeled data products encompass petabytes of earth science data available for analysis, analytics, and exploitation.  Unfortunately, these data are underutilized due to vast computational resource requirements; disparate formats, projections, and resolutions that hinder data fusion and integrated analyses; complex and disjoint data access and retrieval protocols; and task-specific  and non-reusable code development processes that hinder algorithm sharing and collaboration.  Due to these limitations, recent advances in unsupervised machine learning using deep neural nets (DNNs) have not been widely adopted for applications such as pixel-based classification, image preprocessing, feature recognition, and scene understanding.  Creare proposes to develop an open-source, standards-based xxxxxx software framework that removes major barriers to widespread exploitation of geospatial earth science data.  This will be achieved through development of PODPAC (Pipeline for Observational xxxxxx xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and Collaboration), a pipeline-based architecture that (1) enables multi-scale and multi-windowed access, exploration, and integration of available earth science data sets to support both analysis and analytics; (2) automatically accounts for differences in underlying geospatial data formats, projections, and resolutions; (3) simplifies implementation and parallelization of geospatial data processing routines; (4) seamlessly integrates with DNN machine learning frameworks; and (5) unifies access, processing, and sharing of data and algorithms via interfaces to existing xxxxxx repositories.  To demonstrate the impact of these innovations, we will use PODPAC to derive an on-demand, high-resolution global soil moisture data product from the xxxxxx Moisture xxxxxxxxPassive (SMAP) satellite radiometer observational data to support applications in hydrology, agriculture, and humanitarian response missions involving flooding, drought, and water resources.	15343
Innovative Structural and Material Concepts for Low-Weight Low-Drag Aircraft Design, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	The overall objective of this multi-phase project is to explore, develop, integrate, and test several innovative structural design concepts and new material possibilities that will fully leverage the expertise of the ZONA/Boeing xxxxxx for enhancing the current state-of-the-art of aircraft design. The technical objectives specific to the xxxxxx I of this effort are threefold. First, a suitable anisotropic composite material will be identified and further studied for its suitability to the design objectives of this research. A baseline SUGAR aircraft configuration will be thoroughly studied for exploring design possibilities as well as to provide a benchmark for comparing performance improvements achieved by optimization studies performed during later stages. xxxxxxondly, the skin of the baseline SUGAR wings will then be modified to comprise of the anisotropic composite material, and the FE model will be modified to comprise of (1) distributed multiple control surfaces for AAW-type optimization in Design Route 1, and (2) variable camber continuous trailing edge flaps (VCCTEF) for control output optimization in Design Route 2. The updated FE models will then be used to further optimize the composite layup sequence as well as skin thicknesses. Thirdly, the distributed control surfaces and the VCCTEF on SUGAR high aspect ratio wing will be separately optimized for control input to achieve load alleviation and drag reduction. These two separate optimization processes of Design Route 1 and Design Route 2 will be performed iteratively to achieve an optimum low-drag low-weight design. Finally, once the optimum designs are obtained, a detailed performance review will be conducted to quantify the benefits of the non-conventional design technologies explored. A material fabrication feasibility study will also be performed.	15344
Shared Magnetics Hall Thruster, Phase II	2007-12-01	2018-07-19	In the proposed xxxxxx program, xxxxxx Co. will demonstrate an innovative methodology for clustering xxxxxx thrusters into a high performance, very high power propulsion system.  To fulfill the full range of xxxxxx thruster power requirements (100 kW ? 1 MW) envisioned by xxxxxx for orbit insertion, planetary transfers and manned exploration, rather than developing a >500kW system with one or two large thrusters there are clear advantages to reach the very high power by clustering multiple thrusters of lower power.  In the xxxxxx I program, xxxxxx demonstrated a shared magnetics clustering concept that combined the benefits of simple clustering with additional advantages such as the mass savings and power loss reduction of a shared magnetic structure.  In xxxxxx, xxxxxx will demonstrate an alternative shared magnetics concept of clustering and design, fabricate and test a sub-scale nested thruster.  The nested thruster consists of two concentric discharge cavities that share a portion of the magnetic structure.  xxxxxx will also continue to investigate the shared magnetics concept of the xxxxxx I program and merge the nested concept into the shared magnetics cluster architecture.xxxxxx is uniquely positioned to implement the proposed program having expertise in both the clustering of xxxxxx thrusters and shared magnetics thruster development.	15345
Instrument for Airborne Measurement of Carbonyl Sulfide, Phase II	2018-04-01	2018-07-19	In this xxxxxx xxxxxx program, Southwest xxxxxxs will continue the development of small, low power instrumentation for real-time direct measurement of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) in the atmosphere, especially targeting airborne measurements.  The instrument is based on a room temperature interband cascade laser (ICL) operating in the 4800 - 4900 nm region.  This laser has a substantially reduced (by a factor of 40) power requirement compared to quantum cascade lasers operating in the same region and should be better-suited for atmospheric field instruments.  xxxxxx I concentrated on characterizing the sensitivity and precision that can be achieved for OCS measurement, using this laser in a laboratory prototype.  xxxxxx I also demonstrated direct measurement of ambient carbonyl sulfide in the local outside air, at levels of about 450 parts per trillion.  xxxxxx emphasizes development of an airborne-worthy prototype instrument that can be field tested during the xxxxxx performance period.  xxxxxxyl sulfide is the most abundant naturally occurring sulfur species in the atmosphere.  The lifetime of OCS in the troposphere is believed to be several years, allowing its transport into the lower stratosphere where it is photochemically oxidized to sulfate particles. xxxxxx understanding of the tropospheric - stratospheric exchange of OCS is needed to gain a better understanding of its role in sulfate particle production. In turn, the sulfate aerosol layer may significantly influence the earth's energy budget through increased solar scattering. Existing instrumentation for measurement of OCS is bulky and expensive and is complicated by several indirect steps. In contrast, this R&D effort will result in an instrument that measures OCS directly, in real time, with time response of a few seconds or better. At the conclusion of xxxxxx, Southwest xxxxxxs will manufacture and sell commercial instruments for OCS measurement to xxxxxx and the broader atmospheric research community.	15346
Shape Memory Effect Actuators from Chlorides, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	Shape xxxxxxe Technologies is developing a radical new technique for the fabrication of xxxxxx alloys, such as xxxxxx and its ternary alloys of Hf, Zr, and Cu. The technique utilizes these components as chloride feedstock, which are then decomposed onto a substrate.  As the technique involves atom by atom mixing, the microstructure should be both pure and single phase, improving the fatigue life over diffusion-based fabrication methods.     This technique also allows for user selected transformation temperatures over a wide temperature range, user selected external forms and internal geometry allowing for fast acting, high power actuators. By making thin foams and sheets, vibration isolation   sheets can be used for integration into composite materials.     The technique is a radical departure from conventional ingot processing, and will enable applications in high and low temperature actuator and switches in engines, and for thermal energy recovery systems in commercial applications.	15347
Low-Cost, Space-Worthy, Read-Out Electronics For Transition-Edge Sensors	2015-10-01	2018-07-19	For a mission utilizing X-ray microcalorimeters to be selected in the near future, it is critical not only that the key technologies be at the very highest technical readiness levels (xxxxxx), but that the cost and schedule for building the instrument be well known and affordable. In recent years, GSFC has developed the xxxxxxCube 2.0. If we can utilize this high-xxxxxx product, we will have digital read-out electronics that is small, low-mass, and dissipates low power.&nbsp; We will demonstrate that this technical approach is feasible when used in conjunction with our high-performance, low-temperature, superconducting transition-edge sensor (TES) X-ray microcalorimeters, and investigate the limits of the number of read-out channels that can be accommodated by each xxxxxxCube. In carrying out this development, we will learn valuable details about a complex system design that will enable us to accurately determine the development cost and schedule for a flight implementation.&nbsp; By the end of the year, we will have demonstrated a fully realized system &ndash; including a defined grounding scheme, a filtering and isolation strategy, and a viable power distribution strategy. These components are crucial to demonstrating low noise operation of these electronics. Though all development work will take place on inexpensive prototypes, once the electronics have been successfully demonstrated, we will use an actual xxxxxxCube in a final demonstration. The technical readiness of the integrated xxxxxxor xxxxxx, using radiation-tolerant, flight-worthy, read-out components, would be significantly increased.	15348
Environmental Friendly Coatings & Corrosion Prevention for Flight Hardware	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	The objectives for this project are to identify, test, and develop qualification criteria for environmentally friendly corrosion protective coatings and corrosion preventative compounds (CPCs) for flight hardware and ground support equipment. xxxxxx (KSC) has undertaken a study to find environmentally friendly alternatives for the petroleum and solvent-based corrosion-preventive compounds (CPCs) used to protect flight hardware and ground support equipment. Film-forming CPCs leave either a soft or hard protective barrier that prevents moisture from directly contacting metallic surfaces, whereas thin and ultra-thin wicking CPCs displace moisture in cracks and crevices and leave a residue that repels further moisture. To protect an occluded region, the CPC must either form a barrier over the crevice mount or wick into the occluded region. In both film-forming and wicking CPCs, corrosion inhibitors are often suspended in a mixture of solvents and a base oil or grease. The base oil acts as a carrier fluid for the inhibitors and as a moisture barrier. The solvent, which is intended to evaporate after application, acts as a base oil and disperses the inhibitor. xxxxxxhough CPCs can be effective, the base oils are not environmentally benign and the solvents can be toxic and high in volatile organic compounds (VOCs).The candidates tested for use at&nbsp; KSC were soft-film CPCs, both common petroleum-based and newer environmentally friendly types. For this program, &ldquo;environmentally friendly&rdquo; refers to CPCs that are low in VOCs (less than 100&nbsp;g/L), are not hazardous air pollutants, are nontoxic, and are non-carcinogenic. In xxxxxx, the CPCs were applied to various steel and aluminum substrates, which were subjected to atmospheric exposure testing at KSC&rsquo;s Beachside Atmospheric Corrosion Test Site, as well as to cyclic accelerated corrosion testing. xxxxxx 2 consists of more rigorous testing of the down selected CPCs from xxxxxx, new testing of hard-film CPCs, and a study of the failure mechanisms of the different CPC types. xxxxxx 3 testing will determine end use application parameters, including material life cycles, application frequency, and compatibility testing with the specific end uses at xxxxxx so that they can be incorporated into current applications and future flight hardware and ground support uses.&nbsp;	15349
Integrated Propulsion and Primary Structure Module for Small Satellite and CubeSat Applications, Phase II	2017-07-01	2018-07-19	Over the last decade, the CubeSat platform has emerged as a viable alternative for both innovative technology development and scientific investigation. xxxxxxver, to fully realize the platform's potential, propulsion capability is required. For low-cost spacecraft developers, this capability remains among the most resource intensive to successfully implement. xxxxxx xxxxxxources xxxxxxment Corporation (PRDC) proposes to significantly reduce required resources by seamlessly integrating propulsion with another critical resource-intensive subsystem: the spacecraft's primary structure. PRDC will integrate high-reliability COTS components from the medical consumer products industries into an additively-manufactured two-module primary structural element that includes integrated tank, plenum, and manifold geometries for a hybrid green monopropellant / cold-gas propulsion implementation, as well as the spacecraft's launch interface. The resulting system, called the xxxxxxted Propulsion and Primary Structure xxxxxx (IPPSM), provides a standard interface, serving as the strongback for simple integration of other xxxxxx subsystems and payloads within the 6U and 12U size regimes. During xxxxxx, PRDC will continue the IPPSM development initiated during xxxxxx I, culminating in the fabrication, assembly, performance evaluation, and environmental test of a full-scale 12U IPPSM prototype with integrated RCS and high-thrust, high delta-V capability. It is expected that the completion of the above work will result in a technical maturation to xxxxxx-6 by the end of xxxxxx, ready for flight demonstration.	15350
Minimum Cost Nanosatellite Launch System, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx Velocity Corporation proposes the development of a very low cost, highly responsive nanosat launch system.  We propose to develop an integrated propulsion system and launch vehicle configuration that provides responsiveness approaching that of solid propellant systems using a non-toxic storable liquid bipropellant mix, an innovative single pressure vessel stage design, and an integrated engine/tankage system.  The system combines these innovative propulsion technologies with proven sounding rocket operations concepts to minimize cost.  Our two stage nanosat launch system uses rail launch and static stability in early flight phases and a deliberate non-optimum stage sizing to eliminate the requirement for an expensive flight termination system and associated ground infrastructure.  Our focus on inherent system safety and maximum vehicle simplicity benefits the responsiveness, reliability, and cost of space launch.  The propellants chosen are inexpensive, easy to handle, and inherently safe.  These room temperature storable propellants allow use of common, low cost vehicle materials and construction techniques.  The system is scalable, allowing it to be adapted to a wide range of space launch systems.  The design simplicity of the configuration promises to reduce costs and improve responsiveness of space launch systems.	15351

Application of SystemVerilog to Science Mission Simulation, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	"SynaptiCAD proposes to adapt a commercial digital design simulator for use by complex xxxxxx space systems and missions. The simulator is based on xxxxxxxxxxxx, an IEEE-standard language with a long pedigree in the electronics world. Digital simulators offer the potential to scale to very large systems since they are already being used to model circuits with millions of events. xxxxxxxxxxxx, additionally, can easily connect with continuous simulation and engineering analysis tools. Conventional commercial simulators lack this scalability. SynaptiCAD will demonstrate how its own implementation of xxxxxxxxxxxx, encapsulated in a product known as xxxxxx, can be generalized by creating appropriate APIs and model libraries for satellite, robotics, and science mission simulation. SynaptiCAD will further demonstrate that the simulator can connect readily to other engineering environments such as xxxxxx and xxxxxx xxxxxxtion's xxxxxxCenter. A synthesis step will also be illustrated at a basic level, where a hardware design is derived from the resulting simulation. Synthesis is common in the electronics industry and carried out at a highly sophisticated level. A path toward evolving this initially rudimentary synthesis capability will be laid out. The new proposed simulator will demonstrate a realistic xxxxxx problem and show how it can be applied to the full design lifecycle, involving multi-fidelity and multi-disciplinary models. The new simulator will eventually allow for a \"digital twin\" of a flying spacecraft that can be used for realistic validation both during the design and after launch."	15359

The goal of TARM is to increase the efficiency with which capacity-limited transition fixes connecting the enroute and terminal airspaces are used in both clear and disruptive weather conditions, by proactively suggesting reroutes to balance arrival and departure demand across available fixes, relative to capacity, and temporarily reallocating fixes between arrivals and departures when extreme demand or weather conditions warrant.  TARM uses stochastic weather and capacity forecasts.  The TARM concept represents an important step toward xxxxxx xxxxxx Operations by integrating a traffic management decision with individual flight trajectories, and applying a TBO paradigm in which arrival and departure flights are separated by trajectory rather than procedural airspace regions.	15362

Measurement and Modeling of Surface Coking in Fuel-Film Cooled Liquid Rocket Engines	2020-08-01	2018-07-19	The development of future Kerosone/LOX engines will require higher chamber pressures to increase performance and reusability in order to decrease operating costs. xxxxxxver higher chamber pressures result in higher heat fluxes through the walls. This places greater stress on the cooling systems. Fuel film cooling is an effective method to reduce the heat flux, however since the fuel is not combusted, it reduces performance of the engine. Furthermore, an issue with using kerosene as coolant is coking that results from the thermal decomposition of the propellant. This decreases heat transfer and reduces the lifespan of the chamber material. This process has been previously studied in regenerative cooled chambers but the mechanisms for coke formation have not been well established. Additionally, in a fuel filmed cooled chamber the process is much more complicated with coking resulting from interactions with the liquid film and gaseous core flow. Currently the only models that exist for coking have been developed for the chemical and petroleum industries. The conditions inside a rocket combustion chamber however are much more severe and extrapolation of existing models will result in large error. Therefore coking models for rocket conditions are in need of development. For this project, an experimental and computational approach is proposed to understand the coking phenomena at rocket conditions. Experiments will be done to study coking behavior in a heated pipe reactor for the liquid fuel and for combusted gaseous products. SEM and an x-ray elemental detection analysis will be performed to determine the chemical characteristics of the coke layer. The results will be compared with another experiment that will involve coking in a liquid fuel film and gaseous core flow environment. Existing coke models will be modified to match the data at the higher pressure and temperature conditions from the experimental results. The end result would be an experimentally validated coking model that would serve to aid in the design of future reusable liquid booster engines and advance xxxxxx Launch Propulsion xxxxxxs xxxxxx.	15364
On-Line Flutter Prediction Tool for Wind Tunnel Flutter Testing using Parameter Varying Estimation Methodology, Phase II	2013-09-01	2018-07-19	ZONA xxxxxx, xxxxxx. (ZONA) proposes to develop an on-line flutter prediction tool using the parameter varying estimation (PVE) methodology, called the PVE xxxxxx, to ensure the flight safety during the flight flutter test and to prevent the damage to the wind tunnel hardware from the structural failure of the flutter model during wind tunnel flutter test. This tool can be applied to rapidly identify parameters, such as modal damping and frequency from test data measured at pre-flutter flight/wind tunnel conditions, then subsequently to assess the flutter boundary of aircraft/wind tunnel model in real time. In this PVE xxxxxx, several system identification techniques are employed to consistently estimate the damping/frequency of the physical modes, followed by the implementation of xxxxxx flutter margin, damping trends extrapolation, linear parameter varying modeling combined with mu-analysis, and thin plate interpolation method for flutter boundary prediction.  Seamlessly integration of the PVE xxxxxx into IADS (a real-time flight test data acquisition software system) will significantly improve the on-line flutter prediction capability of the PVE xxxxxx.  This robust, production-ready, and flight test demonstrated PVE xxxxxx will provide flight/wind tunnel test engineers an on-line flutter prediction capability in the control room for decision-making during flight/wind tunnel flutter tests.	15365
An Affordable Autonomous Hydrogen Flame Detection System for Rocket Propulsion, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx has long used liquid hydrogen as a fuel and plans to continue using it in association with their advanced nuclear thermal propulsion technology. xxxxxx fire detection is critical for rocket propulsion safety and maintenance. A significant fire at a rocket test or launch facility could be catastrophic to infrastructure or even worse, to human life. xxxxxxion monitoring is problematic as hydrogen flames can be nearly invisible during the day. Non-imaging, non-visible fire detection technology has limited range and can suffer from false alarms from sources outside the region of interest. Low-cost visible imagers, commonly used for wide-scale routine surveillance, have limited utility detecting hydrogen fires. xxxxxxhough it has been known for decades that multispectral imaging outside the visible range can be used to detect fires with low false alarm rates, the price of such systems and the lack of processing algorithms and the ability to implement them in real-time has largely prohibited their use. During this project we will develop a low-cost imaging capability that fuses data collected from sensors operating in the (1) solar blind ultra-violet, (2) thermal infrared and (3) visible spectrum, using advanced spectral, spatial and temporal processing techniques optimized to detect and generate alerts associated with hydrogen fires in real-time. This multi-sensor, multi-processing approach will enable us to automate flame detection with extremely low false alarm rates. In addition to control room alerts, we will make use of the wireless communication capabilities found within smart phones and other mobile devices to build an xxxxxx to alert key decision makers and first responders of a fire detected in real-time. This multi-sensor imaging research could also support xxxxxx important cool flame microgravity research occurring on xxxxxx.	15366

Improved Large Segmented Optics Fabrication Using Magnetorheological Finishing, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	Primary mirrors for large aperture telescopes (>10m) are collections of smaller (1-2m), typically hexagonal, often aspheric, optical segments.   xxxxxx?s next generation specifications demand high precision optical surfaces with practically zero edge exclusion in order to maximize image contrast and resolution.  xxxxxxorheological finishing (MRF) is a sub-aperture process demonstrated to be effective for fine figure control and polishing of a variety of optical glasses and crystals.   The relatively small size and high removal rate of the MRF tool could allow efficient correction of  ?print-through? patterns (or other mid-spatial frequency errors) often observed after conventional polishing.  MRF, however, suffers from edge effects, because the MRF polishing spot changes as it moves over the edge of the part.  Current control algorithms assume the spot remains constant, resulting in edge errors on the order of half of the spot size in width. This proposed effort, therefore, is directed at improving the edge performance of the MRF process, through development of novel software algorithms, improved process methods and/or hardware improvements.  This will be an essential part of a low cost solution for efficient fabrication of large lightweight optics.	15369
Terahertz Quantum Cascade Laser Based 3D Imaging, Phase II	2014-06-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx Constellation program has a need to non-destructively test (NDT) non-metallic materials (foams, xxxxxx Tile, Avcoat, etc) for defects such as delaminations and voids. While imaging systems at terahertz frequencies (0.3 to 3 THz) have been demonstrated for 2D imaging of similar materials, they have not yet demonstrate full 3D volumetric imaging. To meet this need, LongWave Photonics proposes to use high-power, low-frequency terahertz quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) developed at MIT, to  LongWave Photonics proposes a terahertz quantum-cascade laser based swept-source optical coherence tomography (THz SS-OCT) system for single-sided, 3D, nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of non-conductive materials.  The THz SS-OCT system uses a frequency tunable QCL array to generate an interferometric signal between a reference mirror, and a sample.  An algorithm is used to transform this signal into depth information of the interfaces within the sample.  xxxxxx I demonstrated the feasibility of measuring the interfaces of a dielectric on metal sample.  In xxxxxx, we propose to demonstrate a complete scanning system for 3D imaging by upgrading the optics and mechanics.  Improvements in the power levels and frequency bandwidth of the QCL source are expected to greatly improve the depth resolution and signal to noise ratio of the system.  The milliwatt power levels of the QCL are expected to result in fast scan speeds.  Operation of the SS-OCT system is expected to be relatively simple as the QCL is an electrically pumped, solid state source of terahertz radiation, capable of operation in a compact, high reliability crycooler as demonstrated in xxxxxx	15370

Helium-Hydrogen Recovery System, Phase I	2012-02-01	2018-07-19	Immense quantities of expensive liquefied helium are required at xxxxxx and xxxxxxs for pre-cooling rocket engine propellant systems prior to filling with liquid hydrogen, for pressurizing tanks and for safely purging residual hydrogen. Presently, the helium used in these processes is discarded, along with substantial quantities of hydrogen. TDA xxxxxxearch proposes to design and build a compact, portable and cost effective membrane system for recovering, purifying and storing both helium and hydrogen. Recovered helium containing less than a few percent residual hydrogen can be re-used as a purge gas. The ultrapure hydrogen recovered concurrently may be burned as fuel or used to generate clean electricity in fuel cells. The performance of these high selectivity membranes has been demonstrated and is ready for implementation to solve this problem. In xxxxxx I we will fabricate membranes and assess their performance by processing a simulated purge gas stream and determining the purities of the helium and hydrogen. We will also carry out a detailed engineering feasibility and cost analysis to determine the technical viability of scaling up the process in xxxxxx. TDA's system will help xxxxxx conserve valuable hydrogen and xxxxxx rapidly dwindling and expensive non-renewable helium resource.	15372
Easy-to-Use UAV Ground Station Software for Low-Altitude Civil Operations, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	"We propose to design and develop easy-to-use xxxxxx Control Station (GCS) software for low-altitude civil xxxxxx Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operations. The GCS software will allow a UAV user to 1) specify the mission in the user's language, rather than the traditional jargon of mission and flight plan-ning, and 2) execute the mission without relying on additional personnel who have specialized piloting skills. The user specifies the mission through a combination of natural-language instructions and graphi-cal interfaces, and the GCS software translates the user instructions into a mission plan that is executed autonomously. This innovation will enable a paradigm shift in UAV operations by freeing end users from their dependency on expert operators to fulfill the mission.

Improved Models for Prediction of Locally Intense Aeroacoustic Loads and Vibration Environments, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	ATA xxxxxxing, xxxxxx. proposes an STTR program to develop innovative tools and methods that will significantly improve the accuracy of random vibration response predictions for aerospace structures under critical inhomogeneous aeroacoustic loads. This will allow more accurate predictions of structural responses to be made, potentially reducing vehicle weight and cost and improving the reliability of these structures. Empirical wind tunnel test data will be used as a basis to develop innovative methods to characterize the surface fluctuating pressures encountered by launch vehicles during ascent, and then to accurately predict the random vibration environment caused by these loads. The wind tunnel test will measure both the surface fluctuating pressure and the resulting vibration in a flexible panel. xxxxxx I will be spent performing pre-test engineering to reduce xxxxxx risk, generating drawings for construction of test articles, and deriving the test matrix for the xxxxxx wind tunnel test. The objective of xxxxxx I is to demonstrate that the proposed xxxxxx wind tunnel test will be able to provide the test data necessary to improve predictions of fluctuating pressures and random vibration during ascent. xxxxxx will be used to perform the wind tunnel tests for compression corners, expansion corners, and protuberances. The vibration and fluctuating pressure data from these tests will be used to develop more accurate models to predict the auto- and cross-spectra of surface fluctuating pressures during ascent, followed by the development of coupling models to predict the resulting spacecraft structural vibrations. A critical improvement over current methods will be the inclusion of a statistical basis which will enable prediction of both mean and maximum expected environments. The experimental data in xxxxxx will also be made available to other researchers performing unsteady computational fluid dynamics simulations as validation data.	15374

CubeSat Ambipolar Thruster for LEO and Deep Space Missions, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx Industries proposes the development of a novel, primary plasma propulsion system that is well suited for small spacecraft. This technology, called the CubeSat Ambipolar xxxxxx (CAT), would provide xxxxxx and other micro- and nano-satellites with the propulsive capability to make meaningful orbital plane and altitude changes &#151; capability that does not currently exist with state-of-the-art micropropulsion technologies. As such, the CAT engine is an enabling technology that supports xxxxxx, commercial, university, and military CubeSat needs from constellation deployment to lunar orbit insertion and beyond. In the CAT engine, a high-power  RF plasma discharge is expanded adiabatically along a magnetic nozzle topology established by permanent magnets. A resultant ambipolar electric field accelerates the ions to high energies to generate thrust while retaining high propellant utilization. The CAT engine offers a means of providing efficient and high thrust-to-power primary propulsion for xxxxxx and microsatellites. The CAT engine promises to change the CubeSat paradigm from passive sensor carriers to fully capable mission-completing spacecraft. Successful implementation by our team will result in the transition of technology developed  into the commercial sector by a small business, the engagement of the next generation of the space sector workforce, and the infusion of an advanced in-space propulsion technology for future xxxxxx, commercial, and government missions.	15383
Intelligent Electronic Speed Controller, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	This project intends to design and develop an Intelligent xxxxxxnic xxxxxx Controller (IESC) for use on xxxxxx Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).

Interchain transesterification as a solid-state composite welding mechanism, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	We will develop novel composite structures of carbon fiber reinforced high performance aromatic thermosetting copolyester (ATSP) resin composites (ATSP/C) being solid-state bonded to primary metal spacecraft structures in order to build lightweight elements with tailorable structural properties without necessitating additional uses of adhesives or mechanical joints. The ITR bonding approach uniquely enables chemical interfacial (surface) self-welding mechanism effectively consolidating pre-cured parts through a smooth strong and continuous bond line. The ITR bonding fully solid-state process, which eliminates approaches that rely on uncured polymer or a meltable interstitial phase. The ITR ensures physical integrity of joint members of the structure and the reversible adhesive within the range of temperatures experienced during day/night cycles in space. The ITR is the first viable composite welding scheme for fully cured thermoset composites. Tailorable ATSP chemistry can be adapted to nearly any polymer processing technique by adjustments in oligomer structure providing unique advantages compared to conventional polymer matrices. In xxxxxx I, we will develop an out-of-autoclave fabrication method to produce solid-state bond consolidated carbon fiber reinforced ATSP composite laminae and ATSP coated aerospace grade metal substrates. Additionally, we will perform physical characterization, thermomechanical property measurements and performance analyses of ITR bonded specimens. Additionally, we will develop thermal-electrical-mechanical finite element analysis models for optimized composite design with tailorable physical properties.	15385
Nanoscale Vacuum Electronics: Back to the Future?	2013-10-01	2018-07-19	This CIF project developed nanoscale vacuum devices for potential radiation-immune electronics ideal for space applications.  xxxxxx is superior to any semiconductor since electrons do not get scattered as in semiconductors and consequently the electron velocity is the highest. In addition, the absence of charge carriers makes the device immune to radiations and high temperature which are highly attractive for space electronics.  The key to making vacuum electronics practical is to make them nanoscale so that the voltage can be scaled down to below 5 volts, preferably even below 2 volts. Note that even microscale vacuum tubes operate at over 50 volts, hindering their wide use. In addition, the use of standard semiconductor manufacturing processes will help to produce devices on a large scale, thus gaining the cost advantage of the silicon era.We have made substantial progress in making the nano vacuum devices.  We have successfully made the emitter-collector gap of 100 nm using a novel plasma ashing process. It is important to note that we have not used any expensive e-beam lithography to achieve this gap.  We have characterized the fabricated devices using a parametric analyzer and evaluated the current-voltage characteristics.  The operating voltage has been reduced to 7 V.    For devices with a slightly larger gap of 150 nm, the cut-off frequency was found to be 450 GHz, already exceeding the values of state-of-the-art  silicon chips with 32 nm gap.  Finally, we have successfully co-fabricated a conventional MOSFET on the same chip along with the nano vacuum device (side-by-side).  This is for many reasons: 1. To prove, this is standard silicon technology, allowing cost advantages. 2. Actual circuits may use multiple types of devices besides resistors, capacitors and interconnects and thus, it is good proof that our process can simultaneously fabricate multiple types of devices.	15386
High Effectiveness Heat Exchanger for Cryogenic Refrigerators, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	We propose an innovative high performance cryogenic heat exchanger manufactured of titanium by photo-etching and diffusion bonding. This is a parallel plate design of thin laminated titanium foils. xxxxxx is used because of it low thermal conductivity which allows more compact heat exchangers with lower parasitic heat loss. Photo-etched patterns in the foils create the flow passages for the hot and cold flows with solid barrier foils separating the streams. A difficult problem with high performance heat exchangers is balancing the mass flow rate between multiple flow passages required for all but the smallest levels of cooling; this problem can degrade exchanger ineffectiveness by factors of more then 3. Our manufacturing technique allows us to include flow balancing features within the flow passages to automatically balance the flow rates. Recuperative cycle cryocoolers, such as reverse xxxxxx, xxxxxx or their hybrids, require high effectiveness heat exchangers to reach cryogenic temperatures. Higher effectiveness leads directly to improved system efficiency or allows lower temperatures to be reached. xxxxxx heat exchanger performance will directly lead to lower input power cryocoolers particularly for the 4-10 K temperature range where cryocooler system efficiencies are very low.	15387
Multi-Parameter Measurement in Unseeded Flows using Femtosecond Lasers (Tier 1)	2014-10-01	2018-07-19	Measurements in xxxxxx wind tunnels generally consist of force and moment and on-body measurements like surface pressure, surface deflection or heat transfer to the surface.  xxxxxx off-body measurements are needed to understand complex wind tunnel flows and to provide data to validate high-fidelity computational models. Most existing techniques capable of measuring detailed off-body flows, for example, particle image velocimetry, require particle or gas seeding which is not possible in many of xxxxxx tunnels. In this project, two techniques utilizing new femtosecond laser technology will be investigated. Both techniques show promise of measuring multiple parameters quantitatively in unseeded wind tunnel flows. The femtosecond laser electronic excitation and tagging (FLEET) technique can measure velocity and potentially pressure and temperature simultaneously. The femtosecond coherent xxxxxxxxxxxx spectroscopy (FS-CARS) technique can measure pressure, temperature and species concentrations. The two techniques have relative advantages and limitations that will be explored.  The objective of this research project is to leverage recent advancements in laser technology and recent discoveries in academia to discover and apply new ways of measuring aerospace flows. In particular, methods of measuring the gas velocity, pressure, temperature and concentration will be developed. The two different measurement techniques share a common femtosecond laser technology and can be used separately or together to measure multiple gas properties simultaneously in wind tunnel flows and possibly in flight. In this project, we are extending the ability of FLEET to measure multiple parameters such as pressure and temperature simultaneous with velocity.  These additional parameters will be obtained by observing and interpreting the amplitude and spectrum of the FLEET signal.  The main novelty of the proposed work is that FLEET should allow velocity to be measured in several facilities where velocity cannot be curren	15388

Additive Manufacturing of Telescope Mirrors, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx xxxxxx is to demonstrate feasibility of using selective laser melting (SLM) to produce a 3-meter symmetrical radius of curvature (xxxxxx) isogrid mirror substrate which will significantly reduce traditional mechanical machining of the mirror surface before and after nickel plating. The technique in accomplishing this is by fabricating the lens facesheet as the top most layers in the melting process.  This way, our melting technique in producing the best possible finish on the lens surface SLM can provide. If this is successful, then performing a electro-polishing of the substrate before nickel plating the lens facesheet, single point diamond turning (Sxxxxxx) is the only time it is necessary. By developing the SLM techniques having a facesheet xxxxxx with minimum variation, and having an optimized facesheet thickness designed for additive manufacturing, this substrate can be scaled to support flight hardware designs for UVOIR mirrors.	15391

This xxxxxx effort will develop technical solutions to the draw-back of high pressure operation, namely hydrogen gas crossover losses, that is, an increased diffusion of hydrogen across the membrane which effectively decreases the efficiency.Two approaches to reducing gas permeation through the membrane at high pressure will be investigated: 1) The use of palladium thin films embedded in the membrane; and 2) The use of Nafion proton conductive polymer-clay nanocomposite blends.  Two different bonding approaches and membrane configurations will be used for the first approach.  Determining the best composition is the key for the second approach.Promising candidates will be determined by two tests:  1) hydrogen permeability tests; and 2) proton conduction measurements to assure that the effects of reducing hydrogen permeability will not affect electrochemical proton conduction.Finally, the most promising candidates will undergo their final Ph I proof of concept tests in a PEM IFF electrochemical cell. xxxxxx I will lead to the Ph II development of a complete PEM IFF xxxxxxlyzer xxxxxx and delivery of a demonstration unit to xxxxxx.	15392

Low-power Broadband Digitizer for Millimeter-Wave Sensor Array Readout, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxxing in frequency domain using a bank of high-Q micro-resonatorsis an emerging method of reading out large arrays of transition-edgesensors and kinetic-inductance detectors. Low-power digitization of theresultant wide multi-GHz frequency band (e.g., 2-8 GHz) using abroadband superconductor analog-to-digital converter (ADC) enables highfidelity digital readout with immunity from noise, interference andcross-talk. HYPRES, xxxxxx. has recently demonstrated a series of broadbanddigital radio receivers, built around a fast superconductor ADC.  ThisADC has low noise, low power, high linear dynamic range, and highradiation resistance. HYPRES proposes to design a similar ADC which isoptimized for readout of a frequency-multiplexed sensor array such asthat in the xxxxxxSpec far-infrared spectrometer now being developed byxxxxxx GSFC for future space missions. The superconductor ADC can beclosely integrated and matched with the cryogenic sensors, enabling bothreduction in system power and scaling to large imaging arrays.  Duringxxxxxx I, HYPRES will adapt a phase modulation-demodulation ADC forbroadband (8 GHz) input, layout and fabricate an IC combining ADC withdigital readout circuitry, and measure ADC performance with RF tones andan RF comb to simulate the frequency-multiplexed output of a sensorarray. We will also assess the digital readout system for noise andthermal budget, and design the array interface for xxxxxximplementation.  During xxxxxx, HYPRES will work with GSFC tointegrate the ADC with a system testbed for the xxxxxxSpec spectrometerand demonstrate its performance.	15395
A Breakthrough Propulsion Architecture for Interstellar Precursor Missions	2018-01-01	2018-07-19	We propose a new power/propulsion architecture to enable missions such as a 12-yr flight time to 500 AU—the distance at which solar gravity lensing can be used to image exoplanets—with a conventional (i.e., xxxxxx sized) spacecraft. This architecture would also enable orbiter missions to xxxxxx with the same sized spacecraft in just 3.6 years. Significantly, this same architecture could deliver an 80-metric-ton payload to xxxxxx orbit in one year, opening the possibility of human missions to xxxxxx. These are just a few examples of high-impact missions that simply cannot be performed today due to limitations in current technology. Our architecture accomplishes this by combining the following three innovations:A 10-km diameter, 100-MW laser array that beams power across the solar system.A 70% efficient photovoltaic array tuned to the laser frequency producing power at 12 kV.A 70-MW direct-drive, lithium (not xenon)-based ion propulsion system with a specific impulse of 58,000 s.The key to the development of any system for rapid space transportation is the ability to process a lot of power level with little dry mass, combined with the ability to provide a very high total spacecraft velocity change (delta-V) without a lot of propellant. These two requirements translate into the need for a very low specific mass (kg/kW) and a very high specific impulse. A specific mass of 0.25 kg/kW is enabled in our architecture by removing the power source and most of the power conversion hardware from the spacecraft and replacing them with a lightweight, photovoltaic array that outputs electric power at the voltage needed to drive a lithium-fueled, gridded ion thruster system at a specific impulse of 58,000 s. For comparison, the state-of-the-art for specific mass and specific impulse, as represented by the xxxxxx spacecraft, are 300 kg/kW and 3,000 s, respectively.This architecture provides a breakthrough way to take advantage of very high-power lasers, of the type described by xxxxxx, to provide fast transportation though out the solar system and beyond for conventionally-sized spacecraft. We take as a given the existence the “xxxxxx filled 10-km array” from, and assume that its output power has been derated by a factor of a thousand from 100 GW down to 100 MW. Our innovation is the recognition that such an array increases the power density of photons available to a spacecraft illuminated by the laser beam by two orders of magnitude relative to solar insolation at all the solar system distances beyond 5 AU, and that this enormous power can then be used to great effect by driving a highly-advanced ion propulsion system.A high-voltage photovoltaic array tuned to the laser frequency converts the laser power to electric power at an efficiency of 70% and produces an output voltage of 12 kV. The 12-kV output voltage is used directly to provide the net accelerating voltage for the lithium fueled, gridded ion propulsion system eliminating the heavy, inefficient, power processing hardware, and the associated thermal radiators, typically needed to drive ion propulsion systems. The lithium-fueled, gridded ion propulsion system provides a specific impulse of 58,000 s, roughly 20 times the current state of the art. Lithium stores as a solid, is easily ionized, and very difficult to doubly ionize. This allows the thruster to be operated with nearly 100% ionization of the propellant which effectively eliminates neutral gas leakage from the thruster and the production of charge-exchange ions that are responsible for thruster erosion and current collection on the photovoltaic arrays. This key benefit enables very long thruster life and facilitates the development of the 12-kV photovoltaic array.	15396

Fusion-Enabled Pluto Orbiter and Lander, Phase II	2019-03-01	2018-07-19	The Direct Fusion Drive (DFD) concept provides game-changing propulsion and power capabilities that would revolutionize interplanetary travel. DFD is based on the xxxxxx Field-Reversed Configuration (PFRC) fusion reactor under development at the xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx. The mission context we are proposing is delivery of a xxxxxx orbiter with a lander. DFD provides high thrust to allow for reasonable transit times to xxxxxx while delivering substantial mass to orbit: 1000 kg delivered in 4 years. Since DFD provides power as well as propulsion in one integrated device, it will also provide as much as 1 MW of power to the payloads upon arrival. This enables high-bandwidth communication, powering of the lander from orbit, and radically expanded options for instrument design. The data acquired by xxxxxx' recent xxxxxx flyby is just a tiny fraction of the scientific data that could be generated from an orbiter and lander. Engine modeling accomplished during xxxxxx I has shown that we can expect 2.5 to 5 N of thrust per megawatt of fusion power, with an xxxxxx of about 10,000 seconds and 200 kW available as electrical power. We have evaluated the components of the xxxxxx trajectory including an Earth departure spiral, constant thrust planar transfer, and xxxxxx insertion using these thrust and xxxxxx levels, and confirmed the plausibility of the proposed mission. In fact, the mission can depart from LEO with about the mass we originally estimated for an interplanetary insertion, widening the range of available launch vehicles and reducing the cost.The key objective of the xxxxxx proposal is to further advance the design and xxxxxx of selected subsystems, such as the superconducting coils, RF heating, and shielding. PPPL will perform experimental work on the existing PFRC-2 testbed using a gas puff valve, to further investigate the dynamics of the thrust augmentation system (additional gaw flowing through the FRC scrape-offlayer). We will explore the design of a no-thrust mode that captures and reuses the propellant, possibly extracting more power while in orbit around xxxxxx. Finally, we will develop a model of the synchrotron radiation that is specific to the FRC configuration, as available models are derived from tokamaks. Direct Fusion Drive is a unique fusion engine concept with a physically feasible approach that would dramatically increase the capability of outer planet missions. The fusion-enabled xxxxxx mission proposed here is credible, exciting, and the benefits to this and all outer planet missions are difficult to overstate. The truly game-changing levels of thrust and power in a modestly sized package could integrate with our current launch infrastructure while radically expanding the science capability of these missions.	15398

Virtual Sensors: Efficiently Estimating Missing Spectra	2010-09-22	2018-07-19	"Various instruments are used to create images of the Earth and other objects in the universe in a diverse set of wavelength bands with the aim of understanding natural phenomena. Sometimes these instruments are built in a phased approach, with additional measurement capabilities added in later phases. In other cases, technology may mature to the point that the instrument offers new measurement capabilities that were not planned in the original design of the instrument. In still other cases, high resolution spectral measurements may be too costly to perform on a large sample and therefore lower resolution spectral instruments are used to take the majority of measurements. Many applied science questions that are relevant to the earth science remote sensing community require analysis of enormous amounts of data that were generated by instruments with disparate measurement capabilities. This paper addresses this problem using Virtual xxxxxxs: a method that uses modelstrained on spectrally rich (high spectral resolution) data to \"fill in\" unmeasured spectral channels in spectrally poor (low spectral resolution) data. The models we use in this paper are xxxxxx-xxxxxx Perceptrons (MLPs), xxxxxxs (SVMs) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels and SVMs with Mixture Density xxxxxx (MDMK). We demonstrate this method by using models trained on the high spectral resolution xxxxxx instrument to estimate what the equivalent of the xxxxxx 1.6 micron channel would be for the NOAA AVHRR/2 instrument. The scientific motivation for the simulation of the 1.6 micron channel is to improve the ability of the AVHRR/2 sensor to detect clouds over snow and ice."	15400

Development of Grating Technology for High-Resolution Spectrometers Using Nanofabrication Techniques	2021-08-01	2018-07-19	"Several of astronomy's key future science objectives as identified by xxxxxx can be achieved with soft X-ray spectroscopy. This study seeks to develop a new technique for fabricating X-ray reflection gratings to be integrated in future X-ray spectrometer designs. The fabrication method developed in this study will create a reflection grating with a true radial profile, which is a requirement in order to eliminate grating-induced aberrations to the telescope focus and achieve the required resolving power of future missions. If successful, the technology developed in this study will lead to the realization of theoretical X-ray spectrometer performance on timescales consistent with the next decadal survey.This study will build on our research group's strong heritage in the development of X-ray reflection gratings and introduce a new fabrication technique that retains current state-of-the-art grating efficiency while also achieving order-of-magnitude improvements in resolving power. The new fabrication technique is centered around piezoelectric materials and will be approached as follows: first, I will model grating applications of piezoelectric materials and conduct trade-study to determine most suitable piezoelectric materials to be used in grating fabrication. I will then obtain materials and begin implementation of the planned fabrication procedures: create a \"master\" grating with parallel grooves current electron-beam lithography (EBL) employed in our grating fabrication efforts in order to retain the precise groove facets achievable with EBL; the EBL \"master\" will then be imprinted into a soft resist that is coated upon a wafer of piezoelectric material, beneath which are electrodes to control the current through the material; with the parallel-groove profile imprinted into the resist, a variable current will be applied across the piezoelectric material to force the resist to conform to a pre-selected pattern, which will transform the parallel grooves into a radial profile without sacrificing the precise facets introduced in the original EBL write; the pattern will then be UV-cured in order to solidify the resist and lock the radial profile into place; finally, this new piezoelectric master will be used to imprint dozens of replicas.The entire process will certainly require a significant amount of development and trial-and-error, which includes testing intermediate prototypes at xxxxxx centers for both efficiency and resolution. xxxxxxver, if implemented successfully, this technology will make possible both the order-of-magnitude gains in effective area and resolving power over current observatories that is required for future X-ray missions."	15410

We will advance the technology readiness as well as refine the discipline science measurement requirements for the GEO-CAPE effort. The task builds on achievements from our FY'10 IRAD effort and parallel ongoing efforts in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics Branch with the Geostationary xxxxxxgraph (GeoSpec) and xxxxxx Compact Atmospheric Mapper (ACAM) instruments.  The effort will consist of system level packaging, calibration,  and ground-based and airborne demononstrations of a two-channel UV/VIS/NIR spectrograph. Tropospheric ozone (O3) is an important greenhouse gas.  Background concentrations of tropospheric O3 have increased 100-200% over the past century producing a climatic impact comparable to that of xxxxxx (exceeded only by xxxxxx among other greenhouse gases). xxxxxx increases generally have the opposite direct climate impact, diminishing greenhouse warming by reflecting more sunlight back to space.  xxxxxx also affects cloud processes, an indirect climate effect that is unquantifiable today. xxxxxxes in the large-scale atmospheric composition contribute to worsening local air quality in many regions. Declining air quality in the US costs the public billions in health care and lost productivity, produces several thousand premature fatalities annually [1], damages our environment, and decreases our standard of living.t    	15411
Adaptive Supervisory Engine for Autonomous Formation Flying GNC, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	Autonomous multiple spacecraft formation flying represents a critical enabling technology for future space missions, including xxxxxx xxxxxx and xxxxxx Enterprises.  The overall goal of this effort is to develop a general-purpose, onboard xxxxxx xxxxxx (AMSE) for guidance, navigation and control (GNC) functions, suitable for a wide range of formation flying and distributed, multi-spacecraft missions. It will be developed using the concepts of Intelligent xxxxxxs and Hybrid xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxximization.  The proposed approach will use systematic methodologies for formation modeling, optimal resource allocation and task/activity sequencing and control.  During the proposed effort, SSCI will develop and demonstrate an AMSE system for selected multiple-spacecraft formation-flying tasks, using representative constraints for onboard and formation resources.  AMSE technology will provide a general framework for implementation of onboard autonomy for future multiple spacecraft missions, which is both resource and constraint-aware. The AMSE design is most relevant to distributed S/C xxxxxxion Flying missions (such as Terrestrial xxxxxxet Finder), although the concepts and technology are generically applicable to all autonomous S/C systems.	15412

Detectors for Measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation	2016-08-01	2018-07-19	Inflation theory predicts gravity waves in the early universe. These gravity waves are caused by tensor fluctuations, which we expect to have left an imprint in the form of B-mode polarization anisotropies in the CMB. xxxxxxing this polarization is key to confirming and constraining inflation theory as well as a number of cosmological parameters. xxxxxxver, it is very challenging to make such a measurement because the tensor to scalar ratio is expected to be small, especially at large angular scales. In order to achieve the required sensitivity, a new generation of instruments with low-noise, high pixel-count arrays is required. One such instrument is the Q&U Bolometric Interferometer for Cosmology (xxxxxx), a novel ground-based telescope planned for deployment at the xxxxxx station in xxxxxx in 2013. xxxxxx will also forge a technological path for a future space-based mission such as CMBPol. I propose to develop a detector array optimized for the xxxxxx instrument. There are two types of detectors that we believe are the most promising candidates: transition edge sensors (TESs) and microwave kinetic inductance detectors (xxxxxxs), each having advantages and disadvantages in relation to the xxxxxx goals. As the current standard for CMB detector arrays, TESs are an extremely well-understood and thoroughly field-tested technology. Though often regarded as photon noise-limited devices, careful calculation reveals that under reasonable xxxxxx conditions, we can expect the total NEP (photon+ thermal noise added in quadrature) to be ~ 70% greater than the photon NEP limit. Though TESs have the advantage of being highly sensitive and well-understood, they have a few notable disadvantages in terms of their applicability to the xxxxxx telescope. Thermal isolation requirements demand micromachined membranes, which significantly increase fabrication complexity and limit focal plane coverage. Additionally, as arrays push into the multi-thousands of pixels in an effort to achieve the sensitivity needed to detect or rule out the B-mode anisotropy, the technical complexity of SQUID multiplexing schemes is becoming increasingly daunting. The other main candidate for the xxxxxx detector array is xxxxxxs. xxxxxxs have a number of advantages. Most notably, they lend themselves elegantly to passive frequency domain multiplexing, allowing up to xxxxxx0 pixels to be read out with a single transmission line and a single HEMT amplifier. Additionally, since xxxxxxs do not have the thermal isolation requirements of bolometers, xxxxxxs can achieve better focal plane coverage. xxxxxxs do, however, have certain challenges associated with them. There is in addition to the usual photon noise, a contribution resulting from the generation and recombination of quasiparticles known as g-r noise. These noise concerns have so far precluded xxxxxxs use in CMB measurements. xxxxxxver, I have shown that for reasonable xxxxxx conditions a total NEP (photon + g-r noise added in quadrature) of ~20% greater than the photon noise limit can be achieved for an aluminum resonator of reasonable dimensions. This is moderately better than the TESs under equivalent conditions.The key objectives of my proposed research will be to identify which detector technology is best suited for use in xxxxxx and to design, fabricate, test and install a 900-element detector array. Fabricating TESs or xxxxxxs, however, requires a high-level clean room with dedicated equipment for superconducting thin-film deposition to which I do not have access at my home institution. The NSTR Fellowship would allow me to work with scientists at xxxxxxs xxxxxxor xxxxxxment xxxxxx or xxxxxx's xxxxxx, groups which are currently world leaders in cryogenic detector research and among the few groups worldwide having significant experience with TESs and xxxxxxs. Their expertise and facilities will be invaluable in the array design and fabrication process.	15415

PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF CRYOGENIC HYDROGEN RADIATION SHIELD FOR HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx is the most mass-efficient radiation shielding material for protection against the space radiation environment. The concept of xxxxxxgenic xxxxxx Radiation Shielding (CHRS) was studied by&nbsp;xxxxxxgenic Branch at xxxxxx GSFC&nbsp;with a FY08 IRAD. This IRAD project will complete a preliminary thermal and ground cooling system design of the CHRS system and also perform a radiation transmission test with potential CHRS tank materials. The objectives of this IRAD study are to perform the preliminary thermal system design and optimization of the CHRS system and to perform radiation testings of samples of materials that are candidates for containing the hydrogen in the xxxxxx previous study of the concept proposed a potential CHRS geometry. We can meet the thermal design&nbsp;requirements by using proper cryogenic thermal management techniques. Various design&nbsp;options will be investigated for the fluid management system. The fluid management system will provide the required fluid distribution in the tank, and suppress the formation of large gas bubbles. We will use a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis tool xxxxxx&reg; to analyze and optimize the performance of the fluid management system.In addition to the work above, the tank materials will be selected based on the thermal performance. The radiation test for these materials will be carried out at xxxxxx Center for Radiation xxxxxxing and xxxxxx for xxxxxx Exploration (CRESSE).This FY 2014 IRAD study will increase the CHRS xxxxxx level to 2. The design will prove the concept and increase the feasibility of the CHRS system. &nbsp;The output from this study can be used to pursue research opportunities for the radiation shielding at xxxxxx&rsquo;s Human xxxxxxearch Program (HRP).&nbsp;JustificationHuman susceptibility to the harsh space radiation environment has been identified as being a major hurdle for exploration beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). High energy protons and nuclei ions from xxxxxx (SEPs) and xxxxxx xxxxxxs (GCRs) can result in radiation doses that are dangerous to astronaut health and even survivability if the astronauts are not adequately shielded. The high energy particles also cause significant amounts of secondary radiation when they impinge on xxxxxx, which is commonly used for spacecraft structure. The secondary neutron radiation may cause human radiogenic cancers. xxxxxx or hydrogen rich materials are ideal materials for radiation shielding because of hydrogen does not easily break down to form secondary radiation source.A &nbsp;CHRS concept study was conducted by the xxxxxxgenics and Fluids Branch in FY08. The results showed the most mass effective material for protecting a spacecraft if proper design is implemented. The performance of three candidate materials was studied in a xxxxxx study.&nbsp;	15417
Extreme Ultraviolet Imager – Compact	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	Just how far can one shrink an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imager??? &mdash; Can it shrink it to a CubeSat/Small-Sat form-factor???&nbsp; Or perhaps more to the point&hellip; Can one image &mdash; successfully &mdash; xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxar targets from a CubeSat? Given the technical challenges of maintaining optical sensitivity, thermal control and radiation hardening&hellip; perhaps the more vexing question is&hellip; Can one design an EUV imager &mdash; miniaturized specifically for CubeSat implementation &mdash; that is applicable to multiple scientific objectives?We believe that the &ldquo;answer&rdquo; is a resounding Yes!!!&nbsp; To that end, we believe that we are in the unique position to develop a compact, CubeSat-based EUV imager based upon a commercially&ndash;available prototype low-light level camera.

A xxxxxxVista&reg; M711 Camera has already been procured through a previous effort.&nbsp; The EUVIC team will design and implement an appropriate [prototype] comm-interface as well as design, fabricate and implement the necessary mechanical interfaces to mount the M711 camera onto a UV-source calibration chamber &mdash; the EUNIS calibration chamber.&nbsp; We will test xxxxxxVista&reg; M711 Camera under vacuum and then test/validate the efficiency/sensitivity of the camera to a range of EUV wavelengths.&nbsp; The effort will also test/validate the uniformity of &mdash; i.e., &ldquo;flat-field&rdquo; &mdash; the detector.&nbsp;&nbsp; The resulting data set will then used to baseline the viability of implementing this commercially available camera/detector for heliospheric/planetary/solar imaging applications.&nbsp;xxxxxx for radiation hardening and environment testing of the xxxxxxVista&reg; M711 Low xxxxxx xxxxxx Camera will be differed to future/follow-on IRAD proposal efforts, provided that the existing camera displays the necessary spectral response and flat-fielding characteristics desired.	15418
Design Concepts for Low Aspect Ratio High Pressure Turbines for High Bypass Ratio Turbofans, Phase II	2019-06-01	2018-07-19	The performance gains and weight reductions from  using Ceramic xxxxxx) turbine blades in both the  High Pressure Turbine(HPT) and Low Pressure Turbine(LPT) will be determined.  Shrouding HPT rotor blades becomes feasible when low density CMC materials replace current metallic HPT rotor blades. The proposal has two components.  The first is to identify stage efficiency improvements and verify  structural feasibility of shrouding a low aspect  ratio HPT rotor blade designed to use CMC blades.  The second is to perform similar analyses for metallic and  CMC LPT blades . HPT stage efficiency gains will be determined using CFD analyses for shrouded and unshrouded HPT turbines as a function of clearance and stage reaction. The increase in blade component stresses due to the presence of a shroud, and the stresses in the shroud itself will be determined from structural analyses. Comparing analytic results  with available structural data for shrouded metallic LPT blades  will increase confidence in the structural predictions of shrouded HPT blades.The reduction in engine weight from  using CMC blades in the  LPT will be determined.  Current metallic LPT blades are shrouded, so that no significant  stage aerodynamic efficiency gain is anticipated from replacing metallic  LPT blades with CMC blades. In a geared turbine fewer LPT stages, or greater work per stage, may be achieved from using CMC rotor blades.	15419
Sensing and characterization of EMI during intermittent connector anomalies	2013-12-25	2018-07-19	This paper presents a new on-line methodology for detecting intermittent disconnection failures. The detection principle operates on the fundamental Lorentz xxxxxx that states that sudden changes in flux create a large voltage, resulting in an arc. This arc propagates as a traveling wave through the circuit until all the energy associated with it is dissipated. It is possible to detect that traveling wave as an indication of an intermittent disconnection failure. A test bench was implemented to test and validate the theory. Preliminary results presented in this paper show the feasibility of detecting disconnection failures and the possibility of locating the failing connector based on distance.	15420
Verification and Validation of an Innovative Inflatable Structure, Phase II	2012-11-01	2018-07-19	An inflatable habitat is a pressure vessel with flexible shell. Notable features such as low weight, large inflated operational volume, and small pre-deployment volume offer significant advantages over traditional rigid metallic and composite habitat structures. Conventional designs suffer from indeterminacy of load sharing between meridional and circumferential members as well as the internally rigid metal support structure. The designs must functionally index the meridional and circumferential members to one another to minimize sensitivity to manufacturing, handling and operational trauma, all the while maintaining their independent load carrying roles. This design process results in oversized members to account for load uncertainties and substantially increases the handling, manufacturing, and integration risks.  The unique xxxxxx High Performance xxxxxx (UHPV) technology provides the solution to the design and manufacture of robust inflatable structures with exceptional accuracy and dimensional stability. UHPV technology provides high shell load containment architecture with fully determinate load pathways that can be modeled mathematically. The lightweight, low cost inflatable fabric structure, consisting of barrier film layers, carrier cloth containment layers, and pressure restraint tendons can be designed and fabricated to provide an accurate geometry without the need for an internal skeletal frame. Eliminating the need for a rigid internal load-bearing frame allows the collapsed inflatable to be packaged in the smallest possible volume. To bring this innovative inflatable design to use for surface habitats, airlocks and myriad other space environment and containment applications, a verification and validation plan using both testing and predictive analytical models is proposed to conclusively demonstrate that the fully load-determinate UHPV can meet all structural design requirements thereby allowing for decreased mass and risk.	15421
High Performance TRAC Boom for Solar Sails, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	In response to xxxxxx need for compact, low-cost deployable solar sail booms for xxxxxx, xxxxxx proposes to develop a high performance composite TRAC (TRAC HP) Boom system.  The proposed design will advance TRAC technology through: 1) the use of thin-ply composite laminates that are capable of higher packaging strains, 2) the use of high modulus carbon fibers to increase specific modulus of the deployed booms, and 3) incorporating a stepped taper of the boom laminate thickness along its length to improve compression efficiency while minimizing impact to packaged volume.  Preliminary analyses indicate a composite TRAC HP boom can achieve more than a 3X increase in buckling strength and 15X reduction in thermal deformations compared to the Elgiloy TRAC design currently baselined for xxxxxx?s NEA Scout mission.The overarching xxxxxx I objective is to conduct an preliminary design-analysis-fabrication-test loop for a TRAC HP four-boom system capable of meeting requirements for xxxxxx?s NEA Scout mission, and clearly identify engineering development risks that must be addressed to ultimately ensure adequate performance of these booms on-orbit.  During xxxxxx, the TRAC HP Boom system will be developed to a proto-flight level of maturity (engineering design to flight CDR, and manufacturing/test plan in conformance with flight hardware quality standards), and numerous hardware prototypes will be built and tested to establish performance for NEA Scout and other CubeSat solar sail missions of interest to xxxxxx.	15422
Wide Temperature Rad-Hard ASIC for Process Control of a Fuel Cell System, Phase II	2013-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx Group developed a top-level design of a rad-hard application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for spacecraft power management that is functional over a temperature range of -180 to +130 oC. This ASIC is intended to work in conjunction with a fuel cell power system and battery backup to provide uninterrupted power to critical modules in space.xxxxxx has designed a novel integrated circuit for the power management of space systems. This design combines custom circuit modules with silicon-proven IP to create a system-on-chip solution. This application will be a single monolithic circuit designed for fabrication on the IBM 5AM SiGe process. The significance of this innovation is a single reliable component (ASIC) that will meet platform requirements for high voltage, wide operating temperature range, and radiation tolerance (minimum 100 krads total ionizing dose (TID), and 100 MeVcm2/mg single-event latchup (SEL)). xxxxxx has been working with a prime contractor to identify and flow-down mission requirements for the power management ASIC.

Ultrastable and Compact Deep UV Laser Source for Raman Spectroscopy, Phase II	2017-05-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxp-ultraviolet (DUV) xxxxxx spectroscopy is a powerful method to isolate and extract the unique signatures of numerous chemical bonds present within complex samples. DUV (&#955; < 250 nm) excitation is critical for xxxxxx missions because it shows an over 200-fold greater efficiency compared to commonly used 785 nm excitation and illumination as such short wavelengths minimizes the fluorescence background in the xxxxxx spectra.  The unavailability of compact, robust, and reliable deep-UV laser sources has constrained implementing DUV xxxxxx spectroscopy in xxxxxx space-borne exploration and research. TIPD proposes to develop an ultrastable, compact, and robust DUV laser source for xxxxxx spectroscopy based on our demonstrated capability in developing single-frequency fiber lasers and solid-state DUV laser sources. Cooperating with the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx, TIPD developed an ultrastable and compact single-frequency linearly polarized fiber laser system operating at 976 nm during the xxxxxx I program. The team also developed a single-frequency fiber amplifier at 976 nm and single-pass frequency doubling of 976 nm light to demonstrate the viability of the compact design. Separately, the team has designed and delivered a 150 mW DUV laser for xxxxxx spectroscopy operating at 244 nm using a BBO crystal and a resonant bow-tie cavity based upon a 976 nm VECSEL source. In phase II, the team will scale the power of the 976 nm fiber amplifier to achieve a 5-watt single-frequency output. The 5-watt single-frequency 976nm master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) will act as the pump to build a 100-mW deep-UV laser prototype that will be delivered to xxxxxx.	15424
Mixed-Phase Ice Crystal and Droplet Characterization and Thermometry, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	This effort proposes to design, build, and demonstrate a new instrument for icing research and flight safety capable of discriminating liquid water from ice while simultaneously measuring the diameter, velocity, and temperature of droplets or the velocity and size for ice crystals. From these individual particle characteristics the total liquid water content (LWC) and the total water content (TWC) of the flow may be found. This non-intrusive, laser-based, point measurement diagnostic will operate in an off-axis, backscatter configuration at a range of working distances appropriate to characterize laboratory-scale experiments, icing tunnel flows, free jet test facilities, or flight conditions at altitude.The proposed instrument will apply phase-xxxxxx interferometry, polarization ratio phase discrimination, droplet rainbow thermometry, and cross-polarization imaging to each particle measured. This will provide joint measures of liquid/solid phase, velocity, diameter or particle size, and droplet temperature. Furthermore, there is redundancy built into the measurements. For instance, the droplet diameter can be measured both by phase-xxxxxx interferometry and by rainbow thermometry and all four measurement techniques can discriminate solid ice from liquid droplets. While no single instrument can measure all possible cloud droplets, the proposed instrument can be configured to measure droplets from as small as 3 um to larger than 3 mm in diameter.	15425

Cost Reduction of IMM Solar Cells by Recycling Substrates Using Wet Chemical Etching, Phase II	2017-08-01	2018-07-19	The goal of the program is to reduce the cost of substrate reclaim for high-efficiency solar cells fabricated by an epitaxial lift-off (ELO) process, and to increase the number of reuse cycles for a given substrate.  If successful, this will result in a reduction in the cost of xxxxxx-based multi-junction solar cells, in which the cost of the substrate accounts for approximately 50% of the total cost.  The cost reduction is achieved by introducing a new multi-layer etch-stop structure into a inverted metamorphic (IMM) triple-junction cell.  The etch-stop structure is grown between the original xxxxxx substrate and the ELO release layer, thereby becoming the effective substrate surface after the ELO process.  The etch-stop structure prevents pits and surface damage that occur during ELO from damaging the surface of the xxxxxx substrate.  The standard method of reclaiming the xxxxxx substrate after ELO is to employ chemo-mechanical polishing (CMP) to remove the defect-ridden xxxxxx surface and chemically polish the underlying xxxxxx to yield a surface that is suitable for epitaxial growth.  The CMP process works but reduces the substrate thickness and causes minor wafer damage itself, which requires further polishing.  These factors accumulate, in practice limiting the number of reclaim cycles to 5 - 10 for a given substrate.  With the incorporation of the proposed etch-stop structure, the defects are isolated in the etch-stop structure, which can be dissolved by successive selective wet chemical etches to produce the original pristine xxxxxx surface on a substrate of the original thickness.  All mechanical polishing is eliminated in this proposed work, ensuring a constant substrate thickness through repeated substrate reclaim cycles and reducing the estimated cost of the recycling process to <$1 per substrate.  The xxxxxx I program demonstrated that this method for substrate reclaim works; in xxxxxx we will develop the reclaim into an optimized batch process.	15428

ROSA's predicted performance metrics are incredible improvements over current state-of-the-art, and in many cases are mission-enabling for future applications.  The ROSA technology innovation is applicable to practically all xxxxxx and non-xxxxxx missions as a direct replacement for current solar array technologies.  The proposed xxxxxx 2 program has been uniquely structured to methodically develop a feasible scaled-up ROSA solar array system specifically configured for xxxxxx xxxxxx-xxxxxxets mission applications, collaboratively with all the technology stakeholders, and increase technology readiness to xxxxxx 5/6.  The successful completion of the proposed program will rapidly ready the mission-enabling ROSA solar array technology for commercial infusion into future programs.	15430
A Nonlinear Model for Designing Herschel-Quincke Waveguide Arrays to Attenuate Shock Waves from Transonic Turbofan Engines, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx is teaming with the xxxxxx and Acoustics xxxxxx of xxxxxx to propose a non-linear analytical tool for designing xxxxxx-Quincke (HQ) waveguide arrays for the purpose of attenuating upstream-propagating shock waves in a transonic turbofan engine inlet.  xxxxxx will be receiving endorsement and support for this research from the Goodrich Company who owns the HQ waveguide array concept.  Thus far linear acoustic modeling has been used to design HQ waveguide arrays that have experimentally proven to be successful in attenuating far-field sound radiation from subsonic ducted fans.  xxxxxxver, the large transonic turbofan engines used in most civil aviation aircraft today produce large amplitude bow shocks upstream of the fan rotor that nonlinearly scatter energy from the dominant BPF circumferential mode near the fan rotor to primarily lower engine order circumferential modes at the duct entrance, which produces the \"buzz-saw\" far-field acoustic signature.  The non-linear design tool developed by xxxxxxxxxxxxxx in xxxxxx I will be used to design an optimal HQ waveguide array in xxxxxx that will be placed near the fan with the intention of attenuating the BPF circumferential mode in order to reduce scattered energy into lower engine orders that cause far-field \"buzz-saw\" noise."	15431

Application Of Achievability Control Theory To Hybrid Multi-Agent Systems, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	The objective of the proposed project is the development of technology for more efficient and effective human-computer supervision of complex systems. xxxxxxs that combine humans and automation in a synergistic or cooperative manner may be termed hybrid systems. Hybrid systems offer advantages over both purely automated systems and purely manual systems in many circumstances. xxxxxxver, future hybrid systems will be even more complex than contemporary ones. This gives rise to a serious need to develop methods for integrating humans more closely?and more efficiently?than is possible now within hybrid systems.

Performance Enhancement of Deicing Systems with the Use of an Anti-Ice Nano-Coating, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	The proposed program addresses xxxxxx need for a new generation of icing mitigation technology for manned and unmanned vehicles. The state of the art active de-icing method on leading edges involves either an electrical, pneumatic or vibration induced debonding of accumulated ice. There is a need for an xxxxxxice coating that functions synergistically with active de-icing methods. The advantages are reduced power consumption, improved service life of mechanical components, lighter electronics and extra protection in case of failure of active device. The xxxxxx I program has addressed this need and technology gap, and has demonstrated the feasibility of combining a durable xxxxxxice coating with an active deicing device, thereby creating an integrated de-icing system. Icing tunnel testing results demonstrated that the coating provides improved de-icing efficiency, along with a reduction in power consumption of the active de-icing device. In collaboration with a manufacturer of active de-icing systems and a company developing advanced technologies to enhance aircraft performance and safety, the xxxxxx effort will refine the coating composition and application characteristics for use on aircraft so as to meet the stringent requirements of the aerospace and aeronautic industry. Further, we will establish a product specification of an xxxxxxice coating system for use with active de-icing systems and develop protocols for applying the coating at both OEM sites and field applications. The success of the program will lead to prevention of ice buildup on aircraft leading edges, improve aircraft safety, and reduce energy consumption during deicing procedures.	15438

Three Phase Resonant DC Power Converter for Ion Thrusters, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	The new generation of, high performance electric propulsion missions will require high mass throughput and most likely the use of grided ion thruster equipped with carbon based grids will be required to meet the extremely high life requirements.  xxxxxxver, because of the high susceptibility of these carbon based grids to damage during recycle event they will require a low stored energy beam power xxxxxx converter.   An innovative three-phase resonant DC converter, which produces high levels of DC beam power with minimal stored energy is proposed.  This new design combines proven industrial technologies with a innovative new design that relies on combined outputs of phase-shifted converters to produce a low ripple DC voltage without output filtering. It is anticipated that stored energy can be reduced by two orders of magnitude when compared to the ?present state of the art? converters.  Additionally, the resonant power conversion topology facilitates both higher switching frequencies and power densities, which in turn lowers power module mass.  Once complete, these new xxxxxx converters will significantly increase the current state of the art by reducing both the stored output energy and mass of the beam xxxxxx converter.  These changes will enable the present state of the art carbon based grids to obtain the required life for high performance deep space missions.	15448

Pulsed operation of the Ho-oscillator is achieved via passive Q-switching using robust Cr2+-doped saturable absorbers. xxxxxxment of such pulsed seed sources enables the design of compact, rugged, reliable and efficient LIDAR transmitters based on all-amplifier architecture.Direct diode-pumping using the latest 1.9-um diode laser technology provides improved oscillator reliability and compactness. Efficient, Tm:fiber laser pumped, bulk Ho:xxxxxx single-stage amplifier provides energy scaling to mJ level. The choice of a 2-um Ho-laser material (as opposed to xxxxxx) enables efficient power/energy scaling of the pulsed seed oscillator output in high-gain Ho-amplifiers.

Volcanic Ash Nephelometer Probe, Phase II	2014-04-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxanced dropsondes that could effectively be guided through atmospheric regions of interest such as volcanic plumes may enable unprecedented observations of important atmospheric phenomena. IDI proposes to develop a flight ready optical sensor to provide cloud properties and hazardous volcanic ash and icing information within commercial airspace.  The probe will initially be developed for a dropsonde but eventually be integrated into the unmanned SCAN EAGLE UAV. The innovation is a new capability for making in-situ measurement of cloud particulates to improve pilot awareness of hazardous operating conditions, such as those recently experienced by aircraft engines operating near volcanic plumes in the xxxxxx Atlantic near xxxxxx.  .During a xxxxxx I program IDI developed a miniature Nephelometer sensor prototype and demonstrated the ability to measure small ash and water particulates as well as provide discrimination between them.  xxxxxx will integrate the Nephelometer and a commercial SO2 sensor into a radiosonde package for a tethered field test at the xxxxxx Wallops test facility and finally deployed near an active volcano in central xxxxxx.

Advanced manufacturing of intermediate temperature, direct methane oxidation membrane electrode assemblies for durable solid oxide fuel cell, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	ITN proposes to create an innovative anode supported membrane electrode assembly (MEA) for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) that is capable of long-term operation at low temperature by the direct oxidation of dry methane or syngas fuel without coke formation on the anode. ITN's MEA is more efficient, durable, reliable, versatile and economical than the state of the art because it is made with transformative manufacturing techniques &#150; microwave sintering and energy optimized plasma deposition (EOPD). The proposed fuel-flexible, direct oxidation MEA is capable of power densities up to 2 W/cm2 at 600?C. ITN's EOPD of thin, conformal YSZ electrolytes creates a stress free interface between the anode and electrolyte which improves MEA durability, cycle-ability and cell performance. The MEAs produced in this research effort can be incorporated into SOFC stacks capable of producing power in the 1-3 kW range.  Because the fuel is oxidized directly in the SOFC, without external fuel processing, the thermodynamic efficiencies from fuel source to DC output exceed 70%.  Higher efficiencies translate to minimal cooling required as obtained by way of conduction through the stack to a radiator exposed to space and/or by anode exhaust flow.	15459
Miniaturized, High Flow, Low Dead Volume Preconcentrator for Trace Contaminants in Water under Microgravity Conditions, Phase II	2016-04-01	2018-07-19	Thorleaf xxxxxxearch, xxxxxx. has demonstrated feasibility in xxxxxx I and now proposes a xxxxxx effort to develop a miniaturized high flow, low dead-volume preconcentrator for monitoring trace levels of contaminants in liquid water under microgravity conditions. Our innovative design for the preconcentrator combines high water sampling flow rates with low dead volume, thus enhancing preconcentration. This is designed to meet monitoring needs for xxxxxx xxxxxx Water Exposure Guidelines (xxxxxxGs) and addresses a key technology gap for long-duration human spaceflight, since standard techniques will not function without gravitation to stabilize phase boundaries. Human exploration of the solar system will depend on such technology, since water must be recycled and the option of returning grab samples to Earth for analysis from beyond low-Earth orbits does not exist.  During xxxxxx, we plan to incorporate this technology into a miniaturized water preconcentrator module. xxxxxx on our xxxxxx I results we project that it will be possible to develop this module with a mass of about 0.5 kg and average power consumption of <1 watt.	15460

NEMS Oscillators as Sensors and Actuators: Understanding the Mechanical Properties of Nanoresonators and Their Applications for Molecular Sensing	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxment of nanotechnology and enhancement of nanostructures for future applications requires a good understanding of a material's behavior at the nanoscale, as it differs from that at the bulk size. Specially designed xxxxxx Transmission xxxxxxn xxxxxxscope (TEM) holders for this task [i.e. xxxxxx Tunneling xxxxxxscope (STM)-TEM and TEM-xxxxxx Force xxxxxxscope (AFM)] allow a materials' behavior and responses to applied mechanical stress and electric fields to be studied. These xxxxxx STM-TEM and TEM-AFM techniques can be used to address questions regarding the electrical and mechanical stability and capability of materials with high resolution. To our specific interest, we would like to study the mechanical behavior of xxxxxxelectromechanical xxxxxxs (NEMS) oscillators for sensors and actuators applications. The proposed work will study two materials for NEMS oscillators: xxxxxx and amorphous-xxxxxx (a-C) multi branched nanostructures (xxxxxxtrees).The following goals will work includes: To grow fractal multibranched carbon nanostructures and silica nanorods by novel e-beam irradiation techniques developed in our laboratory, To conduct TEM-AFM measurements to obtain their mechanical properties. Deformation forces versus displacement will be measured to directly obtain xxxxxx's modulus, Stress, xxxxxx, and xxxxxx, among others. Mechanical response of xxxxxx will be monitored at different e-beam doses. Mechanical properties for a-C xxxxxxtrees are expected to be studied at xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx, under the supervision of xxxxxx, during the summer of 2011. To use the STM-TEM holder and a radiofrequency source to find the resonance frequencies. For this, two approaches will be used: first, to use a piezoelectric microdevice specially designed for these experiments, and second, to use polarization of an STM tip. xxxxxx and a-C xxxxxxtrees will be grown xxxxxx at the tip of a porous silicon film inside the TEM. xxxxxxonance (or near-resonance) frequencies will be determined, in both approaches, by direct monitoring of the nanostructure's oscillation response. Experimental resonance frequencies and Q factors will be obtained. Mechanical properties, such as bending modulus and xxxxxx's modulus, will be determined from the structures' resonance frequencies, indirectly. To conduct graphitization studies of a-C xxxxxxtrees, by applying a current on the nanotree's branches and thus heating it. This heating is predicted to cause some reorganization of the atomic structure, thus changing the a-C into graphite. Mechanical and electrical properties will be measured for the a-C/Graphite xxxxxxtrees. Our expected outcomes are to combine novel growth techniques and direct in-situ TEM measurements to understand the electrical and mechanical properties of silica nanorods and fractal carbon nanostructures for the development of novel ultrasensitive nanoresonator detectors. In particular: the use of novel growth method for silica nanorods will allow us to tailor its dimension and final shape with nanoscale accuracy to tune resonance frequencies and form silica-based multi-frequency nanoresonator detectors, exploit the fractal structure of multibranched carbon nanofibers to minimize steric effects and develop highly sensitive bio- and chemical sensors. These ultrasensitive resonators can serve as sub-microgram sensors by observing the structure's resonance frequencies. Also, TEM-AFM measurements will provide understanding about the mechanical response of materials at the nanoscale that could guide new developments in nanosensors and actuators technology.	15463

Mobile Greenhouse Gas Flux Analyzer for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Phase II	2016-07-01	2018-07-19	Los Gatos xxxxxxearch (LGR) proposes to develop highly-accurate, lightweight, low-power gas analyzers for measurements of carbon dioxide (xxxxxx) and water vapor (xxxxxx) aboard xxxxxxs xxxxxx xxxxxxted Environmental xxxxxx xxxxxxearch xxxxxx (SIERRA) unmanned aerial system (UAS). These analyzers, which will exploit both conventional mid and near-infrared tunable diode laser spectrometry and LGR's patented Off-Axis ICOS technology, will be capable of meeting the stringent weight, power, and environmental requirements for UAS deployments. At the conclusion of the xxxxxx effort, LGR will deliver and deploy two complete systems. The first analyzer will make extremely rapid (> 20 Hz) airborne eddy flux covariance measurements of xxxxxx and xxxxxx  The second instrument will measure xxxxxx isotopes aboard SIERRA, allowing a better understanding of the chemistry, transport, and exchange of carbon between the atmosphere, anthropogenic sources, and natural carbon sinks and sources in the terrestrial biosphere. xxxxxx measurements enable regional-scale investigations of carbon sources and sinks as well as measurements where conventional tower flux deployments are infeasible.  These data will complement current satellite observations by providing higher horizontal resolution and vertical profiling, enabling better quantification of carbon sources and sinks.  Such deployments are critically important to xxxxxx xxxxxx Division, because they enable more efficient and cost-effective Earth observations.	15468
Broadband Electrically Tunable Monolithic Mid-Infrared Laser	2016-03-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx-xxxxxx spectroscopy is an invaluable tool for chemical detection and identification. While single frequency lasers have been used previously for single chemical detection in xxxxxx missions, a broadly tunable laser offers the possibility to detect a large number of chemicals with a single source. This is invaluable for providing maximum functionality in a limited footprint. Current broadly tunable mid-infrared laser systems utilize one or more laser gain chips and mechanical external cavity tuning in order to span a wide spectral range. This technique is sensitive to mechanical shock and has a limited tuning speed. Our goal is to replace these systems with a compact source that is electrically tunable and mechanically robust. This is a potentially transformative technology that will dramatically improve both SWaP and reliability for future xxxxxx missions. The main goal will be accomplished via three main research tracks: 1) xxxxxxing a broadband gain medium based on quantum cascade laser technology; 2) xxxxxxment of a multi-section, electrically tunable laser design for the mid-infrared; 3) On-chip beam combining and amplification for high power and excellent beam quality.	15469

A Low Noise 64x64 Germanium Array for Far IR Astronomy, Phase II	2015-10-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develope a 64x64 far infrared germanium focal-plane array with the following key design features:1-Four top-illuminated, 32x32 germanium sub-arrays will be tiled together to form a 64x64 mosaic array.  xxxxxx offers very low noise and proven performance in the 50-140?m range.2-The array will use four SB349 CTIA readout multiplexers which are manufactured using advanced cryo-CMOS process.  The unit-cell design is optimized for far IR detectors, eliminates detector debiasing, and improves pixel uniformity.  The readout is operational down to at least xxxxxx3-A novel, layered-hybrid design using planar bump-bond technology will be employed to assemble the focal plane.  This integrated design offers superior noise performance and effectively addresses the readout glow, detector heating, and thermal mismatch between the detector and the readout.  In addition to the large format, this is the key discriminator of this project.This is by far the largest far IR photodetecor array produced with projected sensitivity of &#8804; 1x10E&#150;18 W/&#8730;Hz.  This effort fits well within the scope of the xxxxxx xxxxxx S4.01 and will be a benefit to advanced instrumentation of xxxxxx astronomical missions, in particular SOFIA.	15473
Virtual Satellite Integration Environment, Phase II	2011-03-01	2018-07-19	An integrated environment for rapid design studies of small satellite missions will be developed. This environment will be designed to streamline processes at the xxxxxx xxxxxx Mission Design Center. Several key concepts are introduced. The proposed environment introduces modern Product xxxxxx Management and Product Lifecycle Management (PDM/PLM) tools and processes to satellite mission design. Specifically, the notion of product structure, or bill of material (BOM), is expanded to a simulation BOM, or SBOM, with the capability to manage engineering analysis data, files and processes in the context of a product, in this case satellite mission. This approach constitutes a significant step beyond mere document management, which limits the traceability of which model of which analysis belongs to which version of the geometry or other analysis. It is a key enabler for model re-use. A Linked xxxxxx Environment (LME), i.e. an environment where all engineering analysis models are associatively linked, which was developed concurrently in the commercial aerospace and automotive industry, will extended to satellite mission design. This environment significantly reduces the amount of manual intervention engineers have to perform to translate information from one simulation tool to another. The concept of digital mockup (DMU), which typically addresses form and fit of components in an assembly, is expanded to include function, such that the inclusion of components in a satellite assembly that are functionally incompatible is rejected. Repetitive-iterative engineering tasks will be automated with the help of an integration framework tool which automates the execution of a sequence of codes and provides the capability to wrap drivers like optimizers or quality engineering tools around an automated analysis workflow.	15474

High Speed Digitizer for Remote Sensing, Phase II	2017-10-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx xxxxxx proposal requests support for xxxxxx, xxxxxx. to design and characterize a 24 xxxxxx (gigasamples per second), wide input bandwidth (40 GHz), 6-bit (5.0 effective number of bits, ENOB), low-power (700 mW), and low-cost analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for use in a wide range of xxxxxx microwave sensor remote sensing applications. The ADC does not employ time-interleaving and provides a very wide spur free input bandwidth making it more suitable to xxxxxx remote sensing missions and a variety of radio astronomy applications than any other ADC available.    In addition, the ADC will be radiation hard (>300krad) and thus suitable for use on-board space missions.     A key innovation in xxxxxx's approach to the ADC design is that we have considered how the ADC will be used in a system;  a custom designed digital back-end implements digital data de-multiplexing and signal conditioning to allow seamless integration with commercially available, high-end, field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) that are the main building blocks of modern scientific spectrometers and interferometers. xxxxxx's ADC provides these improvements at much lower power and lower cost than existing commercial ADCs that use off-chip components to provide these features.     xxxxxx's design takes advantage of the latest low-power, high-speed digital CMOS processes, resulting in ADC power consumption that is less than 1/8 of the power consumption of competitor ADCs.    The proposed ADC employs an innovative topology with high-bandwidth front-end sampling circuit combined with an interpolated flash-type ADC and encoder circuitry that simplifies FPGA interfacing.   All the needed clock signals are generated from a low-cost 100MHz crystal clock reference  with a low-jitter (<200fs), radiation-tolerant on-chip PLL.	15476
Global Aerosol Measurement System	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx xxxxxx Measurement xxxxxx (GAMS) project is developing a new, low cost satellite capability for measuring the properties and distributions of particles in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (collectively, the UTLS).&nbsp; This altitude region is important because there have been observed increases in the amount of particles in the UTLS.&nbsp; These particles typically reflect sunlight back into space and cool the Earth.&nbsp; GAMS will measure the altitudes and amounts of these particles by looking to the side of the spacecraft, through the thickness of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, and provide detailed information about how particles are changing in the UTLxxxxxx goal of the xxxxxx xxxxxx Measurement xxxxxx (GAMS) project is to develop needed technologies and obervation strategies to optimally measure the distributions and properties of particles in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS).&nbsp; The GAMS concept is based on the limb-scattering measurement techniques used on past sensors, most directly from the heritage of the xxxxxx xxxxxx and Profiling Suite (OMPS) xxxxxx (LP) currently flying on board the xxxxxx xxxxxxional Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) spacecraft.&nbsp; OMPS-LP was launched on xxxxxx in 2011, with the next planned launch of this instrument in 2022 on the next generation Joint Polar xxxxxx xxxxxx-2 (xxxxxx).&nbsp; Because of the length of time between the NPP and xxxxxx launches there is the potential for a significant data gap for these important measurements.&nbsp; The GAMS concept is intended to be a simple and low cost measurement system that could be ready to fill such a gap.&nbsp;The current OMPS-LP system measures light reflected by particles in the UTLS by looking behind the xxxxxx path, looking through the thickness of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere (i.e., the limb).&nbsp; xxxxxxhough OMPS-LP has proven capable of detecting the presence of background particles in the UTLS, as well as particles from volcanic eruptions and meteorites entering Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere from space, it has very limited spatial coverage and suffers from sensitivity issues since it preferentially sees particles in one direct with respect to the sun.&nbsp; GAMS seeks to overcome both limitations by making measurements of reflected light In two or more directions relative to the spacecraft flight.&nbsp; Because GAMS focuses only on the limb profiling capabilities (versus the more comprehensive by more complicated OMPS system) it can be contained in a relatively smaller spacecraft, which will reduce deployment costs.&nbsp; Additional increased spatial coverage can be realized by flying multiple copies of the GAMS instrument in different orbits.&nbsp;At this stage of the GAMS project we are refining science requirements and measurement capabilities.&nbsp; xxxxxx with simulations of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere from the xxxxxx Earth Observing xxxxxx (GEOS-5) atmospheric model we are refining both the number of viewing directions and the number of spectral channels needed to adequately measure the particles in the UTLS.&nbsp; xxxxxxing work is being performed to refine the GAMS measurement strategy, focused on detector design.	15477

Large Optical Telescope Based on High Efficiency Thin Film Planar Diffractive Optics, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	In future ground-based receivers for deep-space optical communications with spacecraft, aperture diameters of the order of 10 meters are required even with the most sensitive available detectors. Directly applying the technology of 10 meter class ground-based telescopes is cost prohibitive. Also, conventional astronomical telescopes are not compatible with operation within 5 degees of the sun, but such near-sun operation is required with the xxxxxx-based xxxxxx Assembly to provide consistent and reliable wideband communications with interplanetary spacecraft. BEAM Co. proposes to develop a telescope based on diffractive optics that is expected to be far less expensive to manufacture than a telescope based on conventional reflective optics. Our approach takes advantage of the well-defined wavelength of the optical communications beam, thus allowing a high-efficiency design that is expected to be much lighter than a conventional design, thereby reducing the cost of the system that will be used to point the telescope. At the end of xxxxxx I, we will have fabricated and tested subscale diffractive optical elements and performed tests to validate the technology's scalability to large apertures and its capability to support the <20 microradian object space spot size requirement as well as the requirement for near-sun operation.	15479

This developed process will permit hundreds of conceptual and preliminary design trade studies to be performed in a matter of only a few days rather than several months. This shorter time is made possible by replacing or reducing currently required experienced analyst interaction (man in the loop) with predefined knowledge based sizing templates for laminate strength and producibility optimization. xxxxxxovative virtual structural component definitions that 'float' between automatic Hyperxxxxxxr to FEA iteration cycles redefine acreage surfaces areas while simultaneously including connecting bonded/bolted joints. The resulting capability will be an open architecture built within the xxxxxx commercial software suitable for internally integrating xxxxxx or industry developed specialty discipline analysis codes and externally integrating Hyperxxxxxxr with xxxxxx larger design systems. This new capability will be unique in that no other commercial or non-commercial tool will have the same level of depth, breadth, accuracy, speed, verification & validation, and software robustness for performing weight prediction and reduction, structural integrity margins-of-safety reporting, and reliability prediction and improvement.	15484
Infrared Microspectrometer based on MEOMS Lamellar Grating Interferometer, Phase I	2013-02-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx spectroscopy is an invaluable detection and measurement tool intensively used in xxxxxx, xxxxxxar xxxxxxics and xxxxxx experiments pursued from satellite platforms. The geometrical characteristics and sensitivity of satellite infrared spectroscopy systems is often determined or limited by their optical elements. Improvements in optical components allow one to reduce the mass and increase the sensitivity of the system.

A prototype LGI instrument will be deployed in an environment with controlled input of a variety of low-level test gases. We will develop and test detection-identification algorithms and build a characterization set-up to assess the LGI's sensitivity, selectivity and probability of detection.	15485

The result of this program will be near-to-mid IR detectors with higher performance, reduced cooling requirements, and improved radiation hardness. These detectors are compatible with integration into mega-pixel IR imaging arrays for imaging 2.5 &#150; 5.0 micron wavelengths with improved performance and reduced cost, which will be produced in xxxxxx.xxxxxx has teamed with the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx and FLIR xxxxxxs to ensure that this technology can be readily transitioned to meet xxxxxx mission requirements."	15486
Integrated Control Electronics for Adjustable X-Ray Optics	2016-01-01	2018-07-19	The goal of the proposed program is to enable increased angular resolution and collection areas for future major X-ray observatories by incorporating improved figure control of the mirror surfaces. Current X-ray telescopes are limited by inabilities to prepare perfect surfaces. This project will utilize thin film electro-mechanical actuators that allow the mirror surfaces to be adjusted after fabrication. In addition, we will incorporate electronics directly on the actuator to simplify control of individual cells and increase system fault tolerance. This will significantly reduce system complexity and greatly enhance the feasibility of adjustable X-ray optics.	15487
Lunar EVA Dosimetry: MIcroDosimeter iNstrument (MIDN) System Suitable for Space Flight	2008-12-01	2018-07-19	MIDN PROTOTYPE FLIGHT INSTRUMENT 1. xxxxxx on our experience with the MIDN development, we designed and developed an advanced version of the instrument. 2. A prototype was developed that although did not include all of the specifications was able to achieve with a 10 um thick sensor a dE/dx ~ 3 keV/um in silicon that is equivalent to a lineal energy of ~1 keV/um in tissue. BENCHTOP DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM 1. By designing and constructing a new Faraday cage that houses the sensor and preamplifier circuit, upgrading the signal transmission circuitry between the system and the data acquisition area, and designing a new data acquisition method, we were able to reduce the inherent noise level well below a keV/micron, allowing detection of the peak of the dose distributions for minimum ionizing protons, the most difficult particles to detect microdosimetrically. 2. In collaboration with the xxxxxx and xxxxxx at BNL, we have developed a system that allows identification of incident particles, categorized them according to their mass-to-charge ratio and energy, and correlated them with individual events in the microdosimeter. Recall that our earlier work in this regard resulted in our identifying lighter ion contaminants in the beam and their contributions to the microdosimetric spectra, a fact that we subsequently learned was known to BNL personnel. 3. We measured the energy deposited in a microdosimeter with radiation beams of xxxxxx at 290 MeV/n and protons at 1 GeV/n, 600 MeV/n, 250 MeV/n, 100 MeV/n, and 50 MeV/n at the NSRL facility at the BNL and achieved a lower energy cutoff of &lt; 1 keV/um in silicon equivalent to a lineal energy cutoff in tissue of &lt; 0.3 keV/um. ADVANCED SENSOR DEVELOPMENT 1. We now have prototypes of a new design of a solid-state microdosimeter with three dimension micron sized sensitive volumes, addressing some of the shortcomings identified earlier. This sensor was developed at the Centre for Medical xxxxxxearch xxxxxxics, and a new grant (xxxxxxn xxxxxxearch Council xxxxxx Project) was recently received by our collaborator to further support this project. 2. We have established collaborations with the EE (electrical engineering) departments at xxxxxx xxxxxxersity (xxxxxx) to explore the potential of developing alternative silicon sensors. These new sensors will be developed as part of our follow-on grant from the NSBRI. 3. With minimal support, xxxxxx was able to supply us with two dies that have a variety of diodes for preliminary testing. A test fixture was developed to carry out tests, and measurements of alpha particles were successfully conducted. RADIATION TRANSPORT CODES 1. We imported the radiation transport code GEANT4 and two corollary programs MULASSIS (multilayered shielding simulation software tool) and GEMAT. These xxxxxx codes allow us to simulate the microdosimetry spectra in silicon devices. 2. We also have access to the MCNPX (xxxxxx N-xxxxxx eXtended) radiation transport code.	15488

High Performance Spatial Filter Array Based on Signal Mode Fiber Bundle, Phase I	2012-08-01	2018-07-19	Loveraging on Agiltron's experience in optical fiber components, Agiltron proposed a coherent single-mode fiber (SMF) spatial filter array (SFA) with a gradient index fiber (GIF) lens array pair to meet xxxxxx application of planet exploration. There are several advantages over the current approach in: small aberration, low insertion loss, high uniformity, low cost, easy assembly and high stability.  In xxxxxx I, Agiltron will build a GIF-based SFA prototype to prove the feasibility of the proposed low cost program for xxxxxx applications. At the same time, a theoretical study will be made to build a simulation model for the proposed SFA. This simulation and actual physical testing will provide the necessary baseline for us to build and demonstrate a prototype including the mechanical enclosures in xxxxxx. We expect to provide fully functional and environmentally tested production units for xxxxxx in xxxxxx.	15490

Novel Read-Out Integrated Circuit with Individual Pixel Programmability for Astronomy Infrared Focal Plane Arrays, Phase II	2018-10-01	2018-07-19	One of the key components in many xxxxxx missions is a large-format focal plane Focal xxxxxxe Array (FPA) to capture images or two-dimensional, hyperspectral information, especially in xxxxxx (IR) domain. Apart from the detector, the performance of these FPAs is determined by xxxxxx (ROIC) that amplifies and multiplexes photo generated charge for signal processing by peripheral circuitry.In this project, we propose to develop a new ROIC for low background applications, specifically designed to overcome present limitations of image persistence and inter-pixel capacitance (IPC). The main innovation in this project is an adaptive unit cell that can be individually and randomly programmed via on-chip logic to control bias state and reset duration of any pixel in the array while the integration of science data is on-going.In xxxxxx I we conducted a pixel trade study and performance evaluation for a xxxxxx Trans-xxxxxx Amplifier (CTIA) and a source follower per detector (SFD) type pixel using analog circuit simulations. Then we generated the optimum unit cell layout, defined the overall architecture and created the top-level schematic. By the end of xxxxxx I we have completed the blue prints for the design. The completion of the top-level schematics, verified through simulation, is a critical milestone in the development. It substantially reduces the risk associated with creating new ROIC technology and will allow us to efficiently fabricate and test the device in xxxxxx. All results from xxxxxx I are documented in a preliminary xxxxxx Control Document (ICD) so that the new ROIC can be considered for future missions.In xxxxxx we will produce the layout of the entire chip for fabrication using stitching lithography in a state of the art CMOS foundry and demonstrate its functionality on packaged prototypes. By the end of xxxxxx, wafers of a known functioning ROIC design will be available for hybridization.	15496

Centrifugal Sieve for Size-Segregation/ Beneficiation of Regolith, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Utilizing centrifugal force as the primary body-force, combined with both shearing flow and vibratory motion the proposed centrifugal-sieve separators can provide efficient gravity-level-independent size classification of granular feedstock like lunar regolith.  xxxxxx size separation methods for dry materials often depend on gravity as the primary body force. For separation of small sizes, gravity-force is usually supplemented with vibration and shearing flow. Granular materials naturally stratify during shear-flow with larger particles rising to the top. xxxxxx on frequency and intensity, vibrations alone can induce large particles to rise to the top in a granular bed, independent of shear flow.  The proposed centrifugal size-separators utilize the natural size stratification of flowing granular solids. They will function equally well under reduced gravity conditions and in vacuum. The nominal design is a configuration with only one moving part and no blades, or other high-wear components. Shearing flow and vibrations combined with a size-separating screen at the outside (or 'bottom') of the flow will separate particles, with the fines passing through the outer wall screen, and the coarse material passing axially through the continuous feed system. xxxxxx size separation streams are possible. xxxxxxernate designs with shear-enhancing blades, 'above' or inside the screen, will also be evaluated. Various approaches for screen deblinding, and other robustness enhancements, are part of the proposed designs. With appropriate selection of passing-screen size, and deblinding enhancements, the centrifugal-sieves could be used for regolith processor feedstock conditioning to remove material > 0.5cm diameter, and with alternate settings and screen size, also used for a degree of beneficiation, to select particular size ranges that have the highest percentage of desired mineral content.  The centrifugal-sieve concept can be scaled to any desired mass flow rate.	15498

Procedure Execution and Projection System, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	There is a persistent pressure upon xxxxxx crew members to achieve very high productivity during their missions. Significant challenges exist to maintaining manageable workload while the crew is performing their many and varied tasks allotted for each day while ensuring the crew maintain situation awareness. xxxxxx crew members deal with a large amount of very high technology equipment and perform experiments and procedures that can be extremely long and complex.The solution will require the development of automated management technologies that will operate synergistically with the crew, automating tasks of varying complexity in a dynamic, flexible manner with representations of automation state that the crew is familiar and comfortable with. In this proposal, xxxxxx proposes to leverage crew members' capabilities with the design of a distributed xxxxxxedure Execution and Projection (PEP) system that focuses on supporting automation of complex procedures while ensuring crew situational awareness and anticipating future problems.Our team will leverage the recent work on the xxxxxxedure Representation xxxxxxuage (PRL) and the flexible, distributed and hierarchical capabilities of holonic systems. PRL is an XML encoding of the vehicle/habitat procedures in a form that both crew and automation can use, and the PEP systems' intelligent holonic modules will support crew with a range of capabilities, including automation of procedures, projection of procedures to look for problems and determine courses of action to prevent or mitigate the problems, and make sure that the crew maintain situational awareness of the procedural state.The objectives of the xxxxxx I project are to establish critical requirements for xxxxxx vehicle and habitat crew automation and to design and implement a prototype of the PEP system to demonstrate approach viability.	15502

In addition, other xxxxxx gases, such as nitrogen and argon, occur in concentrations high enough to be useful as buffer gas and should be captured as well. To achieve these goals, highly efficient gas separation processes will be required. These gas separation techniques are also required across various areas within the ISRU project to support various consumable production processes.&ldquo;Living off the land&rdquo; with resources indigenous to a planetary body such as xxxxxx, or ISRU, requires mission-enabling capabilities that will be a necessary part of further exploration of the solar system.

The IMM also provides an objective foundation for mission planning dialogue based on evidence and all available relevant data sources.	15508
Communication Optimizations for a Wireless Distributed Prognostic Framework	2013-06-19	2018-07-19	Distributed architecture for prognostics is an essential step in prognostic research in order to enable feasible real-time system health management. Communication overhead is an important design problem for such systems. In this paper we focus on communication issues faced in the distributed implementation of an important class of algorithms for prognostics – particle filters. In spite of being computation and memory intensive, particle filters lend well to distributed implementation except for one significant step – resampling. We propose new resampling scheme called parameterized resampling that attempts to reduce communication between collaborating nodes in a distributed wireless sensor network. xxxxxx and comparison with relevant resampling schemes are also presented. A battery health management system is used as a target application.	15509

RotCFD: A Viscous Design Tool for Advanced Configurations, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	The incorporation of viscous analysis in design is vital for a completeunderstanding of aerodynamic problems.This proposal offers to develop and integrate with xxxxxx a method for semi-automatically generating grids suitable for viscousanalysis on complex configurations as well as parallelize the solver in xxxxxx to take advantage of today'smulti-core machines.The principle idea behind the semi-automation of the grid generation is to divide the geometry surface into patches andgenerate body-conforming grids from these patches.This partitioning allows for automatic generation of grids withaspect ratios suitable for viscous flows.Convection dominates the outer region, so unstructured Cartesian meshescan be generated quickly and easily here.The outer grid will be conformed to the inner grid so the entire gridcan be treated as one unstructured grid with an unstructuredsolver, or as a hybrid grid with multiple zones and solvers.In the hybrid approach, viscous solvers can be used for the inner zonewhile the faster inviscid solvers can be used in the far-field.In xxxxxx I a proof-of-concept grid generator, and a conceptual methodology for solverparallelization will be developed and demonstrated to work with xxxxxx therotor aerodynamic design tool.In xxxxxx, the features of the grid generator and solver willbe fully developed and expanded.	15512
An Intelligent Autonomous Executive for cFS Distributed Spacecraft Missions, Phase I	2017-06-01	2018-07-19	Distributed xxxxxx xxxxxx (xxxxxx) have become increasingly important in the effort to extend the capabilities of instruments to gather critical Earth and xxxxxx science data. xxxxxxs, which include constellations, formations and clusters, have already been employed and have been proposed for several future space science missions. xxxxxx (MMS) mission is a current xxxxxxar-terrestrial xxxxxx mission comprising four identically instrumented spacecraft flying in a relatively close formation to study the Earth?s magnetosphere. xxxxxxhough they open up new science frontiers and new possibilities for satellite design, constellations will be limited if their operations costs scale with the number of satellites. A key enabling technology for future xxxxxxs will be their ability to operate with a level of autonomy to leverage the capabilities of a standard-sized team of satellite operators to safely operate a fleet of satellites. Our innovation is the development of a cFS xxxxxx suite, called the Distributed Automation Suite for Heuristic Execution and xxxxxx (DASHER), which extends the current state of the art in onboard automation for spacecraft flight software. The main component of DASHER is a mission manager that can execute science observation and engineering plans intelligently.

Metal Mesh Filters for Terahertz Receivers, Phase II	2007-11-01	2018-07-19	The technical objective of this xxxxxx program is to develop and demonstrate metal mesh filters for use in xxxxxx low noise receivers for terahertz astronomy and atmospheric studies. Metal mesh filters, based on a free-standing sheet of metal with a periodic area of apertures, have been used for many years. xxxxxxver, they have proven to be extremely difficult and costly to fabricate and are not presently available over a large part of the terahertz frequency band (100 GHz through 10 THz). Also, the terahertz filters that are available from commercial suppliers tend to have unacceptable loss in the pass-band (20% or more) and often cost over one thousand dollars per filter. Through this program VDI is developing new fabrication processes and mesh designs that will improve performance and greatly reduce costs. Successful completion of this program will make the filters available for xxxxxx terahertz missions, facilitate the development of improved terahertz detectors (by facilitating bolometer calibration and testing) and also make the filters commercially available for the greater range of terahertz applications that are now emerging, such as imaging systems and spectrometers.	15514
Transonic Stability Test of Variable Drag Ballute, Phase II	2005-10-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx, or inflatable decelerators, offer significant advantages over rigid shells for aerocapture of planetary spacecraft and for earth reentry of cargo by providing mass savings and simplified packaging features. Traditional ballutes, however, have provided little or no trajectory control. For new platform functionality, high drag must be accompanied by some degree of control; also, incorporating thermal protection into the design provides additional weight savings. xxxxxx are typically designed to create a low ballistic coefficient, reducing heating rates. xxxxxxver, a low ballistic coefficient also makes them inherently susceptible to insertion trajectory errors, atmospheric density variations, and winds. The use of a variable drag design allows for in-flight adjustment of ballistic coefficient. This significantly lowers downrange dispersions, resulting in a higher reliability recovery system. The specific innovation proposed is the design of a forward-attached, variable drag ballute for atmospheric entry. To demonstrate dispersion control in a forward-mounted ballute, xxxxxx proposes two flight tests of a subscale, pressure-supported, symmetric ballute that modulates drag by internal pressure control. The experiments are designed to demonstrate the ability to actively vary drag and prove transonic stability while avoiding an aeroheating environment requiring specialized thermal materials.	15515

Novel Ultrasound Assessment of Dynamic Muscle	2012-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxstantial research shows that skeletal muscle undergoes atrophy during spaceflight. Because maintenance of the musculoskeletal system is of crucial importance for mobility of astronauts during long-duration missions and upon return to 1-G, it is vital to learn as much as possible about muscle structure and function. Current reports on muscle atrophy following disuse or microgravity are based on study of a single anatomical cross-sectional area, a measurement that ignores more detailed changes in muscle structure. Significant insight into the relationship between muscle structure and function could be achieved by improving muscle imaging techniques. In particular, acquisition of ultrasound imaging during muscle contraction to monitor muscle dynamics could provide critical information regarding microgravity-induced strength loss.xxxxxx of the musculoskeletal system is of crucial importance for mobility of astronauts during long-duration missions and upon return to 1-xxxxxx, substantial research shows that skeletal muscle undergoes atrophy during spaceflight. xxxxxxs on muscle atrophy are typically based on study of cross-sectional area, a measurement that ignores more detailed changes in muscle structure. xxxxxx of the structure of skeletal muscle is key to understanding its function. xxxxxxsound imaging of muscle during contraction could provide important insight into the relationship between muscle structure and function. Importantly, the use of novel ultrasonographic techniques to evaluate dynamic muscle structure may provide critical information regarding the underlying mechanisms of microgravity-induced strength loss. Five subjects performed various passive and active contractions while ultrasound images of the rectus femoris were obtained. We demonstrated that acquisition of contracting muscle is obtainable using a high frequency ultrasound probe, and that the contracting muscle can be tracked with various algorithms using a custom xxxxxx program. This work was completed in xxxxxxember, 2012. Further investigations are needed to determine the most valid algorithm for tracking muscle, to assess the reliability of the muscle tracking technique, and to ascertain the association between torque and skeletal muscle strain. Tracking xxxxxx in xxxxxx Program: xxxxxxsound images of tissue consist of a set of intensity forming 'speckles' that create patterns. If the ultrasound probe remains in the same position during a movement, the changes in the speckle patterns represent movements in the tissue. These movements can be directly and actively followed using speckle-tracking algorithms. Movements of the tissue over the course of an image sequence can then be quantified by monitoring changes in the position of the speckles. Five muscle tracking algorithms were tested with each algorithm outputting muscle strain throughout contractions. xxxxxx of xxxxxxsound xxxxxx with xxxxxx Program: On a typical ultrasound image (xxxxxxure), the cross sectional area of the muscle (rectus femoris) appears in the center of the image. xxxxxx inspection confirmed that relative motion between the edges can be used to estimate the changes in length and thickness of the muscle. The muscle tracking algorithms automatically tracked the change in position of each marker from the initial frame to subsequent frames for the duration of the contraction.	15517

Rapid Damage-Free Shaping of Lightweight SiC Using Reactive Atom Plasma (RAP) Processing, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	The proposed effort seeks to determine the feasibility of dramatically reducing the manufacturing cost and cycle time of lightweight silicon carbide mirrors by substituting a novel reactive atom plasma (RAP) process for traditional hard tool grinding and lapping. The RAP process employs an inductively coupled plasma torch with common gaseous fluorine compounds to produce a spatially controlled material removal profile. The plasma is scanned over the surface of the material to be shaped under the control of special algorithms to produce the desired optical form. The RAP process exhibits high volumetric material removal rates on xxxxxx and other optical materials. The avoidance of surface and subsurface damage by the use of this non-contact RAP process is expected to significantly reduce the time and cost of optical finishing. RAP-shaped substrates will be polished by several candidate technologies to establish optimum finishing strategies.	15519
Interface Everywhere: Further Development of a Gesture and Voice Commanding Interface	2013-06-01	2018-07-19	"To capitalize on developments in voice and gesture control, we must identify a framework by which reliable control interfaces can be developed before these technologies will be taken seriously for application in spaceflight or commercial industry. Previous projects have successfully generated prototype interfaces for concept demonstration purposes but fall short of fully characterizing the available technologies and systematically identifying intuitive voice/gesture 'vocabularies' and design principles which will be necessary for flight applications. This project will leverage from previous projects but will establish a foundation (vocabularies, design principles, technology baseline and framework) from which serious integrated solutions to human interface needs can be built. Our goal is to develop a number of prototype interfaces with specific applications that would lead to specific voice and gesture solutions.xxxxxxural xxxxxx (NUI) is a term used to describe a number of technologies such as speech recognition, multi-touch, and kinetic interfaces. Gesture and voice control are two exciting computer input modalities for the NUI. Some believe that NUI is the next step forward from the traditional graphical user interface (GUI), which employs a mouse and keyboard as the primary means of input. The goal of NUI is to develop interfaces that do not have a steep learning curve and the interactions with these interfaces are \"natural\" and intuitive to the user. One disadvantage of current GUIs is that they require the users to be physically near an input device in order to interact with the system. With the NUI, however, through using voice and gesture commands, the user is able to interact with the system anywhere they want within the defined work environment. Such \"xxxxxx Anywhere\" gesture ability is achievable using infrared technology. The voice recognition portion is achievable through array microphones and xxxxxx software. Our NUI system of choice for this proof of concept is the xxxxxxsoft xxxxxx sensor. The heart of the system and what makes gesture recognition possible is the xxxxxx's skeleton tracking ability. The xxxxxx contains an infrared projector and receiver, a normal RGB camera, and an array of four microphones. The system tracks multiple users in x-, y-, and z-space. xxxxxx on the depth information, the xxxxxx generates a skeleton using joint position."	15520
Deep Ultraviolet Macroporous Silicon Filters, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx xxxxxx I proposal describes a novel method to make deep and far UV optical filters from macroporous silicon. This type of filter consists of an array of parallel, independent leaky waveguides made in the form of a free-standing, two-dimensionally ordered silicon structure with pore walls coated by a dielectric multilayer. The proposed filters offer unmatched levels of rejection within a very wide rejection band combined with a high level of transmission within the pass band that can be centered throughout the deep and far UV range. In addition, unlike common interference-based filters, the spectral position of the pass and rejection bands will not depend on the angle of incidence. The proposed filters will be light weight and may be manufactured cost-effectively in large quantities. In xxxxxx I, it is proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of the method by fabricating pore structures with different pore wall coatings and measuring the transmission and other optical properties.  In xxxxxx, optimized filters will be fabricated and their properties compared with design predictions.  xxxxxx will involve product design, fabricating filter structures to meet customers' physical as well as optical needs, and marketing and sales investments.	15521

Second Generation of Reagentless Carbon Analyzer for Water Quality Monitoring, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	Water reclamation is one of the basic functions of the closed regenerative life support systems needed for manned space missions. To assure the quality of the recycled water, particularly for human consumption, monitoring of key water quality parameters, such as total organic carbon (TOC), pH, and conductivity is critical. TOC instruments are used to assess the levels of organic contaminants present in recycled water. xxxxxx seeks for significant improvements in miniaturization, accuracy, precision, and operational reliability, as well as long life, real-time measurement, in-line operation, self-calibration, reduction of expendables, low energy consumption, and minimal maintenance for those monitors. Current available TOC analyzers do not meet those standards. This proposal concerns the development of a small, effective, energy-efficient, reagentless carbon analyzer (RCA). It will combine (i) electrochemical technology to produce two key elements in TOC analysis, acid and oxidant, and (ii) photolysis for the complete oxidation of organic carbons to carbon dioxide.

A Flexible Cognitive Architecture for Space Exploration Agents, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	In space operations, carrying out the activities of mission plans by executing procedures often requires close collaboration between ground controllers who have deep knowledge of the spacecraft's systems and crewmembers who have on-board situation awareness. Because of the light distances involved, this close collaboration will not be practical for inter-planetary exploration. This proposal seeks to develop a software cognitive architecture for space exploration (CASE) that will autonomously carry out exploration operations by using the same knowledge and executing the same plans and procedures as those developed on Earth. Over the past several years, xxxxxx, in support of xxxxxx and other government agencies, has developed a number of components that can be used in such an architecture, and now proposes to design an exploration agent based on that architecture and to show that it is feasible for use in space exploration. These components include a procedure development system known as PRIDE that allows for variably autonomous execution of both crew and robotic procedures, an automated planner that plans and re-plans the execution of procedures to achieve overall mission goals, and an ontology data management system that makes system states available to all the components. In this work we will develop two new but vital elements for the architecture: a process manager that will manage the use of distributed computing resources to support the CASE components, and a natural language dialog system to allow the crew access to any part of the architecture. CASE will provide a feasible approach to agent design for space exploration, provide on-board autonomy in nominal operations and human-computer solutions for off-nominal operations, allow for the interchange of components from external sources and be robust in the face of computational failures.	15528

Estimation of Time Varying Autoregressive Symmetric Alpha Stable	2010-09-22	2018-07-19	In this work, we present a novel method for modeling time-varying  autoregressive impulsive signals driven by symmetric alpha stable distributions. The proposed method can be interpreted as a two-stage xxxxxx sampler composed of a particle filter, which is capable of estimating the unknown time-varying autoregressive coefficients, and a hybrid xxxxxx method for estimating the unknown but constant  distribution parameters of a symmetric alpha stable process. This method is an alternative to a recently published technique in which both the autoregressive coefficients and the distribution parameters are estimated jointly within a single sequential xxxxxx framework—the single particle filter technique. The proposed method achieves lower error variances in estimating the distribution parameters compared with the single sequential xxxxxx technique, and thus, successfully models symmetric impulsive signals.	15537

The goal is a breakthrough in cost and reliability for a wide range of payload sizes and types supporting future orbital flight vehicles.  Lower cost and reliable space access will provide significant benefits to civil space (human and robotic exploration beyond Earth as well as Earth science), to commercial industry, to educational institutions, for support to xxxxxx xxxxxxoratory, and to national security.  xxxxxx?s xxxxxxs call xxxxxx storage of cryogenic propellants for long duration missions? the #2 ranked technical challenge for future xxxxxx missions, and new technologies are necessary for improved cryogenic propellant storage and transfer to support xxxxxx exploration goals.  Heat leak through tank mounts such as struts and skirts is an increasingly large part of the total heat flow into modern, well insulated tanks. Specifically, xxxxxx has a high priority for simple mass efficient techniques for vapor cooling of structural skirts (aluminum, stainless, or composites) on large upper stages containing liquid hydrogen and liquid methane (can include hydrogen catalyst).  xxxxxx cryogenic insulation that can incorporate vapor cooling to reduce the heat flux through struts and skirts would benefit cryogenic fluid management, and help towards achieving zero boil off.xxxxxx (xxxxxx) is a novel system that uses discrete spacers to create a sealed vapor layer within IMLI for lightweight, efficient vapor cooling of tank skirts.

Uncovering effects of climate variables on global vegetation	2017-03-01	2018-07-19	The objective of this project is to understand the causal relationships of how ecosystem dynamics, mostly characterized by vegetation changes, in different geographical areas with distinct eco-climatic variability, are affected by regulating climatic factors and other anthropogenic disturbances and extreme events. xxxxxxhough this is a well-studied problem, the state-of-the-art in this area has significant room for improvement. For example, climate variables such as precipitation, solar radiation, and temperature have traditionally been studied as limiting factors affecting plant vegetation growth. xxxxxxver, a quantitative analysis of the influence of unknown or unexpected driving forces on vegetation anomalies is still missing in the context of abrupt climate change (e.g. persistent drought, heat waves) and human-induced local events (e.g. forest fire, irrigation). Similarly, most prior studies have based their analyses on assumptions of linearity and certain types of nonlinearity in the dependency relationships between observed/modeled climate variables and satellite-derived vegetation indices. We hypothesize that such assumptions may not hold true in practice when scaled over large regions, thereby rendering the non-generalized models and the understanding of ecosystem dynamics potentially misconstrued. In this study we propose to use a regression technique called 'symbolic regression' for learning these complex time-space relationships and their evolution over time. This genetic programming based learning technique has demonstrated the potential of discovering new dependency structures among variables that were previously unknown. Using symbolic regression, we not only expect to uncover new relationships among well-studied climate variables, but also identify latent factors responsible for vegetation anomalies. We will use xxxxxx high-end computing and data infrastructure at the xxxxxx Earth Exchange facility in order to scale this evolutionary optimization based regression technique to build global prediction frameworks using hierarchical and ensemble approaches. The benefits of this work will be in improving the understanding of the ecosystem dynamics and generalizing those understandings from regional to global scales. The work will leverage the results of previous xxxxxx-funded efforts, both in terms of data sets and computing infrastructure. The work will aim to answer three science questions starting at the local level and then moving to a global scale. They are:  1) what is the magnitude and extent of ecosystem exposure, sensitivity and resilience to the 2005 and 2010 xxxxxx droughts, 2) what are the human-induced and other attribution factors that cause vegetation anomalies in certain geographical regions that cannot be otherwise explained by the natural climate variability, and, 3) how does the learned dependency of vegetation on the climate variables and other exogenous factors vary across different eco-climatic zones and geographical regions on a global scale? This project will develop algorithms that will answer the three questions listed above with the help of the domain scientist's validation. This modeling exercise based on symbolic regression is the first of its kind for earth science applications. Therefore, entry xxxxxx of the project is 2. On successful completion of milestones, the exit level xxxxxx is expected to be 4, where the capabilities have been validated at a global scale. The interdisciplinary team includes expertise in large-scale data mining, symbolic regression, evolutionary optimization, and Earth science, to meet the technical challenges of this project.	15541

Optimetric Measurements with Continuous Optical Carriers Phase of Coherent Optical Communication	2017-09-01	2018-07-19	We propose to perform a study and experimental demonstration of ultra-high precision optimetric measurements (50 nm range error, 50 nm/s ranging rate error) with continuous optical carrier phase measurement on a coherent optical communication system. This approach improves optimetric measurement sensitivity by orders of magnitude vs. the current RF or RF over optical based optimetrics (10 &micro;m range error, 10 &micro;m/s ranging rate error). It will be game changing technology with such high precision ranging and high bandwidth communication. It will service both science and NAV/COMM at a new level of ranging precision and comm capacity. It will also advances the state-of-the-art for the optical comm system with high bandwidth and high precision ranging. It will be an enabler for precision formation flying missions that include: virtual sensors, sensor webs, large-number-multi-spacecraft distributed missions, autonomous rendezvous &amp; docking; and enabler for gravitational based small-sat scientific missions.Continuous optical phase measurement improves ranging accuracy by orders of magnitude due to the nature of much higher optical carrier frequency (4 to 5 orders of magnitude higher than RF). To demonstrate this phase measurement over optical communication links, our study will leverage the vast technology progress in the fields: 1. High speed coherent optical communication (Telecomm) (&gt;100 Gbit/s) with photonic integrated circuit (PIC) and high speed analog and digital electronics.&nbsp; 2. Low noise laser source for gravity wave measurement (xxxxxx) enables continuous optical phase measurement over long distance (&gt;1 million km). This study will leverage the state of art hardware from both fields to demonstrate close xxxxxx grade phase measurement accuracy and greater than 100GBPS data communication capability. Furthermore, we propose two more experiments to be implemented on the platform by taking advantages of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). 1. WDM combines a second channel with low noise CW laser. It further improves the phase measurement accuracy by avoiding high data rate (&gt;25 GHz) phase modulation introduced noise. 2. WDM combines two more CW optical channels, then performs a cross correlation among these two channel. This operation enhances the common mode signals (the relative distance of the two satellites) and suppresses uncorrelated noises (electronics, laser, and digital noised). It will lower the instrument noise floor, reduce the hardware complexity, and hence further reduce the xxxxxx This proposal also leverages last year&rsquo;s CIF/IRAD project &ldquo;High Precision RF xxxxxx and xxxxxx Rate Measurements over xxxxxx and xxxxxx Communication in xxxxxx xxxxxx&rdquo; on both technologies and methodologies. The success of this study will provide platform with both ranging over continuous optical phase (~50 nm error) and high rate coherent optical communication.	15551

Radiation and High Temperature Tolerant GaN Power Electronics, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx electronic components with high operating voltages are desirable in xxxxxx xxxxxx Management and xxxxxx (xxxxxx) systems since they can lead to reduced mass and higher efficiency at the system architecture level, and serve as an enabling technology for solar electric propulsion systems. Gallium nitride (xxxxxx) offers significant advantages over silicon (Si) technologies for power applications including higher breakdown voltage and power density, rapid switching, lower switching losses, and higher temperature tolerance. Enhancement mode xxxxxx-on-Si high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) are a rapidly advancing technology that are scalable with voltage, offer superior electrical performance, and also demonstrate high tolerance to displacement damage and total ionizing dose (TID). xxxxxxver, prior tests have shown that heavy ion (HI) induced leakage currents and catastrophic damage may occur well below rated voltages. A thorough investigation of the HI response of emerging, higher voltage xxxxxxs and underlying mechanisms is essential to develop radiation tolerant devices for space applications. CFDRC, in collaboration with xxxxxx xxxxxxersity and EPC, proposes to use an integrated experimental and physics-based modeling approach to address this challenge. In xxxxxx I, we will perform heavy ion testing of commercial EPC xxxxxxs to generate response data. xxxxxx TCAD models will be developed for the HEMT structure to investigate physical mechanisms behind measured radiation response. In xxxxxx, we will perform additional heavy ion and TID testing as a function of temperature and bias. Extensive TCAD and higher-fidelity modeling will be performed to determine radiation and temperature-dependent mechanisms, and to investigate device design modifications for improved radiation tolerance. Promising solutions will be prototyped and characterized via testing. Participation by EPC in xxxxxx and beyond will ensure advanced space-qualified, xxxxxx power devices.	15557
Development of Modular Spray-Cooled Assemblies for High Heat Fluxes, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx xxxxxx project will develop modular spray-cooled assemblies that satisfy xxxxxx power and mass budgets and can be scaled to cool multiple heat sources subjected to high heat fluxes and microgravity conditions.  Much of the work on spray cooling has been experimental in nature and technological improvements have been the result of extensive experimental work.  There is a need for a better theoretical understanding.  xxxxxx xxxxxxnics xxxxxxing xxxxxxutions L.L.C. (PELS) analytical team has formulated mathematically the conditions for extracting high heat fluxes from a heated surface in addition to the latent heat of vaporization that takes place in the formation of the bubble under phase change.  PELS has now the opportunity of combining its analytical and experimental capabilities to develop modular assemblies based on spray cooling with the goal of achieving heat fluxes in excess of 100 W/cm2 while satisfying power and mass budgets.	15558
Efficient Quantification of Uncertainties in Complex Computer Code Results, Phase II	2013-06-01	2018-07-19	Propagation of parameter uncertainties through large computer models can be very resource intensive. Frameworks and tools for uncertainty quantification are generally geared to individual codes, are research codes, or are single-purpose tools such as LHS matrix generators. The xxxxxxd-Order-Clustering-Uncertainty-Quantification (xxxxxxUQ) methodology discussed in this proposal is specifically designed to circumvent many of the issues associated with uncertainty quantification of large simulation codes. The xxxxxxUQ methodology has been applied in several different physical disciplines with good results. The computational methodology is a combination of reduced-order modeling, stratified sampling (xxxxxx -- LHS), statistical clustering of results (K-means clustering) and a few (five to ten) full-physics runs of the high-fidelity model under investigation. The method should be applicable to hundreds of uncertain variables when required. xxxxxxUQ enables estimates of system response quantities (SRQ) uncertainty distributions for situations where it is not feasible to use purely sampling, collocation, or other techniques where many runs would be required. For some organizations, uncertainty analysis has never been possible due to resource limitations, and thus is not part of the organizational culture. Many analysts know that uncertainties can be important, but have no way to expend sufficient resources (money, CPU cycles, time) to do the work needed to quantify uncertainties. A methodology such as xxxxxxUQ promises to open doors in organizations that know that they have the need, and may now be able to actually perform the analyses. Successful completion of the xxxxxx project will produce not only new software that will be able to be used by researchers and industry, but will assemble insights on the use of reduced order models in a variety of disciplines, and provide guidance and rules for the use of xxxxxxUQ for the estimation of SRQ uncertainty distributions.	15559

VOYAGER 2 JUP LOW ENERGY CHARGED PARTICLE CALIB. BR 15MIN	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	THIS BROWSE DATA CONSISTS OF RExxxxxxLED DATA FROM THE LOW ENERGY CHARxxxxxx PARTICLE (LECP) EXPERIMENT ON VOYAGER 2 WHILE THE SPACECRAFT WAS IN THE VICINITY OF JUPITER. THIS INSTRUMENT MEASURES THE INTENSITIES OF IN-SITU CHARxxxxxx PARTICLES (>26 KEV ELECTRONS AND >30 KEV IONS) WITH VARIOUS LEVELS OF DISCRIMIxxxxxxION BASED ON ENERGY, MASS SPECIES, AND ANGULAR ARRIVAL DIRECTION. A SUBSET OF ALMOST 100 LECP CHANNELS ARE INCLUDED WITH THIS DATA SET. THE LECP DATA ARE GLOBALLY CAxxxxxxTED TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE (SEE BELOW) AND THEY ARE TIME AVERAxxxxxx TO ABOUT 15 MINUTE TIME INTERVALS WITH THE EXxxxxxx BEGINNING AND ENDING TIMES FOR THOSE INTERVALS MATCHING THE LECP INSTRUMENTAL CYCLE PERIODS (THE ANGULAR SCANNING PERIODS). THE LECP INSTUMENT HAS A ROTATING HEAD FOR OBTAINING ANGULAR ANISOTROPY MEASUREMENTS OF THE xxxxxx ENERGY CHARxxxxxx PARTICLES THAT IT MEASURES. THE CYCLE TIME FOR THE ROTATION IF VARIABLE, BUT DURING ENCOUNTERS IT IS ALWAYS FASTER THAN 15 MINUTES. FOR THIS BROWSE DATA SET ONLY SCAN AVERAGE DATA IS GIVEN (NO ANGULAR INFORMATION). THE DATA IS IN THE FORM OF 'RATE' DATA WHICH HAS NOT BEEN CONVERTED TO THE USUAL PHYSICAL UNITS. THE REASON IS THAT SUCH A CONVERSION WOULD DEPEND ON UNCERTAIN DETERMIxxxxxxIONS SUCH AS THE MASS SPECIES OF THE PARTICLES AND THE LEVEL OF BACKGROUND. BOTH MASS SPECIES AND BACKGROUND ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED FROM CONTEXT DURING THE STUDY OF PARTICULAR REGIONS. TO CONVERT 'RATE' TO 'INTENSITY' FOR A PARTICULAR CHANNEL ONE PERFORMS THE FOLLOWING TASKS: 1) DECIDE ON THE LEVEL OF BACKGROUND CONTAMIxxxxxxION AND xxxxxx THAT OFF THE GIVEN RATE LEVEL. BACKGROUND IS TO BE DETERMINED FROM CONTEXT AND FROM MAKING USE OF SECTOR 8 RATES (SECTOR 8 HAS A 2 mm AL SHIELD COVERING IT). 2) xxxxxxIDE THE BACKGROUND CORRECTED RATE BY THE CHANNEL GEOMETRIC xxxxxxxxxxOR AND BY THE ENERGY BANxxxxxxS OF THE CHANNEL. THE GEOMETRIC xxxxxxxxxxOR IS FOUND IN ENTRY 'channel_geometric_ factor' AS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH CHANNEL 'channel_id'. TO DETERMINE THE ENERGY BANxxxxxxS, ONE MUST JUDGE THE MASS SPECIES OF THE OF THE DETECTED PARTICLES (FOR IONS BUT NOT FOR ELECTRONS). THE ENERGY BAND PASSES ARE GIVEN IN ENTRIES 'minimum_instrument_parameter' and 'maximum_instrument_ parameter' IN TABLE 'FPLECPENERGY', AND ARE GIVEN IN THE FORM 'ENERGY/NUCLEON'. FOR CHANNELS THAT BEGIN THEIR NAMES WITH THE DESIGxxxxxxIONS 'CH' THESE BANxxxxxxSES CAN BE USED ON MASS SPECIES THAT ARE xxxxxxED INTO THAT CHANNEL (SEE ENTRIES 'minimum_instrument_parameter' and 'maximum_instrument_ parameter' IN TABLE 'xxxxxx', WHICH GIVE THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM 'Z' VALUE xxxxxxED -- THESE ENTRIES ARE BLANK FOR ELECTRON CHANNELS). FOR OTHER CHANNELS THE GIVEN BANxxxxxxS REFERS ONLY TO THE LOWEST 'Z' VALUE xxxxxxED. THE BANxxxxxxSES FOR OTHER 'Z' VALUES ARE NOT ALL KNOWN, BUT SOME ARE GIVEN IN THE LITERATURE (E.G. KRIMIGIS ET AL., 1979). THE FINAL PRODUCT OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE THE PARTICLE INTENSITY WITH THE UNITS: COUNTS/(CM**2.STR.SEC.KEV). SOME CHANNELS ARE SUBJECT TO SERIOUS CONTAMIxxxxxxIONS, AND MANY OF THESE CONTAMIxxxxxxIONS CANNOT BE REMOVED EXCEPT WITH A REGION-BY-REGION ANALYSIS, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN DONE FOR THIS DATA. THUS, TO USE THIS DATA IT IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL THAT THE CONTAMIxxxxxxION TYPES ('contamination_id' , 'contamination_desc') AND THE LEVELS OF CONTAMIxxxxxxION ('data_quality_id' CORRESPONDING TO THE DEFINITIONS 'data_quality_desc') BE CAREFULLY EXAMINED FOR ALL REGIONS OF STUDY. A DEAD TIME CORRECTION PxxxxxxEDURE HAS BEEN APPLIED IN AN ATTEMPT TO CORRECT THE LINEAR EFFECTS OF DETECTOR OVExxxxxxIVE (PULSE-PILEUP). THIS PxxxxxxEDURE DOES NOT FIX SEVERELY OVExxxxxxIVEN DETECTORS. A PxxxxxxEDURE IS AVAILABLE FOR CORRECTING VOYAGER 2 LECP ELECTRON CONTAMIxxxxxxION OF LOW ENERGY ION CHANNELS, BUT ITS EFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN EVALUATED ONLY FOR THE URANUS DATA SET. THUS, CORRECTIONS U HAVE BEEN APPLIED ONLY TO THE URANUS DATA SET.	15562

A Novel Navigation Robustness and Accuracy Improvement System, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	To address xxxxxx need for L1 C/A-based navigation with better xxxxxxspoofing ability and higher accuracy, Broadata Communications, xxxxxx. (BCI) proposes to develop a new Navigation Robustness and Accuracy Improvement (NRAI) system, based on BCI's innovative noise nulling and observable combiner technology. BCI's novel approach incorporates the innovations of the highly successful multiple-antenna detection technique and the optimized fast quad diversity combiner technique, enabling BCI to meet xxxxxx requirements for reliability, safety, and high accuracy by effectively nullifying the interference noise from GPS receiver data and eliminating errors and ambiguities in observables. The NRAI system offers a 4-6 dB SNR improvement factor over current techniques and increases the accuracy of L1 C/A navigation to less than 1 m and 1 cm/s, which directly fulfills xxxxxx requirement of xxxxxxspoofing ability and high accuracy. In xxxxxx I BCI will demonstrate the feasibility of the NRAI system by building and testing a preliminary prototype, which will demonstrate xxxxxx-level 3-4 by the end of xxxxxx In xxxxxx, BCI plans to develop a fully functional prototype and demonstrate the xxxxxxspoofing and high-accuracy navigation performance of NRAI. The demonstrated results will offer xxxxxx capabilities of accurate and reliable navigation using L1 C/A code.	15564
The StratoCruiser Propulsive Long Endurance Balloon Gondola, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx measurement technologies are required to support science campaigns to better quantify rapid loss of permanent floating ice volume in the Arctic Ocean, accelerating loss of the xxxxxx glacial system, recurring drought conditions in the xxxxxx continental interior, and increasing frequency and intensity of severe storms in both coastal zones and in the nation's central corridor. While balloon measurements offer persistence and relative low cost when compared to aircraft systems, they lack the ability to reposition, station-keep, or navigate along or across observed gradients. Similarly, aircraft offer the ability to target regional phenomenon, reposition, and navigate to areas of interest but are costly to operate and lack the persistence of balloons. The StratoCruiser balloon gondola concept offers unprecedented mobility and the reel-down payload support for executing unique in-situ studies of large-scale convective events. Combining the persistence of balloon platforms, the vertical measurements of soundings, and the mobility of aircraft the StratoCruiser will enable new understanding of stratospheric phenomenon. The StratoCruiser carries the unique Harvard&#150;designed reel-down payload and winch system. The winch allows the suspended payload to be lowered from a vehicle at rates of 5-10 m/s up to a distance of 10 km. These soundings provide in situ detection of radicals, isotopes, ozone, reactive intermediates, long-lived tracers and condensed and vapor phase xxxxxx and HDO.	15565
Development of Small-Volume, High-Precision, and Reliable Cryogenic Linear Actuators by Using Novel Intermetallic Compounds	2019-10-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx missions often involve ultra-cold environments, and cryogenic actuators must be mechanically robust for long-term cyclic work, generate high power per volume, as well as perform high precision motion in such extreme environments. These demanding requirements have asked a material scientist to seek for a new type of actuator materials. Recently, we discovered a bulk-scale novel intermetallic compound CaFe2As2 that can exhibit superelastic deformation and ultra-high strength, which leads to unusually high actuation power per volume, 10xxxxxx0 times larger than most actuator materials, as well as cryogenic linear shape memory effects even near 0 K. The cryogenic linear actuation of this crystal is exceptionally repeatable, precise, and reliable with almost no fatigue damage, which would guarantee the long lifetime and high accuracy in actuation motion. Therefore, the research objective of this proposal is to develop a small-volume, high-precision and mechanically-robust cryogenic linear actuator by performing the combined set of works that include (1) large single crystal growth of novel intermetallic compound CaFe2As2 and related structures, (2) evaluation of their cryogenic linear actuation performance, (3) understanding of fundamental physics behind cryogenic actuation properties, and (4) development of proto-type linear actuators that operates at a temperature between 4 and 150 K.	15566
Lunar EVA Dosimetry: Microdosimeter-Dosimeter Instrument	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	The overall objective of this research project is to design, develop, and test an engineering model solid-state microdosimeter (SSMD) by December 2012 suitable for use in the new xxxxxx spacesuit and robotic operation on rovers, tool boxes, and spacecraft. The benchtop instrument continues to be used to develop and investigate improvements to the state-of-the-art of SSMDs. This past year the focus has been on development of improved preamplifiers. Radiation sources available at the USNA have been used to carry out the test protocols. The benchtop system has been expanded to obtain and analyze microdosimetric spectra for incident NSRL beams of both protons and heavy ions with identification of particle types in the beam, their energies, and their mass-to-charge ratios and those produced by intervening materials. We carried out tests of our bench-top system with a neutron beam generated in the Nucleonics xxxxxx at the USNA with favorable results. An improved version of the flight engineering model, MIDN-xxxxxx, has been designed and is nearing completion. It has a reduced footprint and mass and expanded remote command capability. It will be available for test by the end of 2010. We processed data sets obtained at the NSRL/BNL from our benchtop system, flight engineering model MIDN-II, and two Far West HAWK tissue equivalent proportional counters. Inter-comparisons of the observations agreed well and also agreed with xxxxxx simulations. These spectra have been added to our past data sets to update our extensive library of microdosimetric spectra. We continued development our unique optical calibration system for a SSMD that permits continual end-to-end system test and calibration while the instrument is operational deployed. This is an alternative to using a radiation source that is problematic in a personal dosimeter and eliminates handling and shipping restrictions and personnel and facility certifications required by international, federal, and local regulations. Our provisional patent application was superseded by a patent application in Sep 2010. We have tested our second generation microdosimeter sensors with our bench-top and flight engineering instruments and compared our results favorably with those obtained at the xxxxxxersity of Wollongong. We received a sample of our third generation solid-state microdosimeter sensors in November and will begin testing at the beginning of the year. We completed an initial conceptual design of our instrument to fit within a xxxxxxxxxxxxs configuration for deployment on xxxxxx through the auspices of the DoD xxxxxx Test Program. The xxxxxxxxxxxxs configuration is modeled after the design of a cubesat. Our configuration would be 10cm x 10cm x 15cm with the majority of the volume dedicated to a rechargeable battery power supply.

Integrated Production of Ultra-Low Defect GaN Films and Devices for High-Power Amplifiers, Phase II	2011-07-01	2018-07-19	High quality xxxxxx epitaxial films are one of the keys to current efforts for development of both high-power/high-speed electronic devices and optoelectronic devices. In fact, solid state lighting, high-temperature and high-power electronics, microelectronic and mechanical sensors, and high-efficiency solar cells are all poised at a new level of development. This enormous market is waiting for low-cost, high quality substrates to achieve performance and fabrication economies of scale. After achieving dislocation densities below 1E7 cm-2 in the phase I work, this xxxxxx xxxxxx phase II project addresses the development of a dislocation filter that can routinely prepare low-stress xxxxxx thin films with threading dislocation densities below 1E6 cm-2. The method relies on using a low-angle ion beam to induce both nanofilter for defect reductions and to inhibit droplet formation at low growth temperatures. Dislocation densities have so far been determined by standard etch pit densities method. The goal the project to optimize the multiple defect nanofilter with smoothening by transition layers in between filters to reduce the TD to less than 1E6 cm-2 and process, fabricate high performance HEMT for solid state high power amplifier (SSPA) applications. To obtain a more practical evaluation of the effectiveness and commercial viability of the method, heterojunction field effect transistors with high electron mobility will be fabricated in these ultra-low defect density films. These high-quality material based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) will enable high linearity power amplifiers with excellent thermal stability and frequency response. The proposed method to grow on low-stress, low-dislocation density films will lead to the production of electronic devices of unparalleled performance.	15569

Certain microbes can be harvested to effectively change chemical sugars into electricity through a fuel cell, which can provide a higher power density than a traditional lithium-ion battery. This process will be used to slowly build up a storage of electricity, which will provide a burst of energy to the vehicle's novel hopping or rolling mobility system. In this xxxxxx I study, the study team will investigate the usability of a microbial fuel cell to power a small microrover, design low-power electronics for effective power management of this system, and develop an efficient low-power non-traditional locomotion system to propel the lightweight vehicle forward. Small microrovers with this power system could one day support long-duration research studies on planetary surfaces without the need for large solar panels or complex power systems.

Advanced Composite Truss (ACT) Printing for Large Solar Array Structures, Phase II	2018-05-01	2018-07-19	Large solar arrays (100 kW-1 MW) are required in order to generate the  power necessary for solar electric propulsion to drive xxxxxx future missions, including: Asteroid Redirect Mission, xxxxxx Exploration, and xxxxxx Commercial Supply. The advantages and benefits of large solar array designs will only be realized if the array support structure weight and packaging volume are minimized. SDC's xxxxxxanced Composite Truss (xxxxxx) additive manufacturing technology can provide a 30-40% weight savings and a 250-300% improvement in power per unit volume over existing state-of- the-art solar array boom structures. The xxxxxx technology consists of the lightweight advanced composite truss, the autonomous low-packing volume xxxxxx printer, and an integrated solar array deployment system. The weight of the xxxxxx structure is designed to optimize the load carrying path within an open truss architecture. The material for the truss is efficiently packaged within the envelope of the xxxxxx printer prior to launch. Once in orbit, the xxxxxx printer autonomously manufactures the xxxxxx structure without the need for mechanical joints. The xxxxxx printer can be scaled to manufacture any size, length, and/or geometry truss required to meet the prescribed mission requirements. Following the manufacture of the xxxxxx truss, the integrated drive system of the xxxxxx printer autonomously deploys the solar array.	15573

Modular Power System Configured with Standard Product Hybrid DC-DC Converters, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	VPT proposes an innovative concept whereby complex, multiple-output, xxxxxx converter systems can be configured through use of only 2 standard product hybrid xxxxxx Converter modules.  The key module attributes that make this feasible are: programmable output, parallel current-sharing capability, synchronization capability, dual (plus and minus) output voltage, xxxxxx-output-case isolation, external shutdown, total dose and single event effects radiation hardening, and ability to be element evaluated, screened, and qualified to MIL PRF 38534 Class K (space flight) standards.  Once these attributes are satisfied, it is shown that highly complex systems can be designed and delivered with a minimum of nonrecurring engineering.  This includes 28V or xxxxxx input systems, low voltage and higher voltage outputs, and highly varying output power.  The system allows output series operation for increased output voltage, as well as input series operation to accommodate increased input voltages.  This is all accomplished without the need of a centralized controller.  This confines most of the common failure modes to graceful degradation as opposed to catastrophic shut down.  In xxxxxx I, it is demonstrated that a complex, multiple output system, xxxxxxin, 1KW system is configured with multiple xxxxxx, 28V input modules.	15575

Superior Speech Acquisition and Robust Automatic Speech Recognition for Integrated Spacesuit Audio Systems, Phase II	2012-01-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxs suffer from poor dexterity of their hands due to the clumsy spacesuit gloves during xxxxxx (EVA) operations and xxxxxx has had a widely recognized but unmet need for novel human machine interface technologies to facilitate data entry, communications, and robots or intelligent systems control. The objective of this research project is to develop a speech human interface that can offer both crewmember usability and system operational efficiency. But loud noise and strong reverberation inside spacesuits make automatic speech recognition (ASR) for such an interface a very challenging problem. In xxxxxx I, the feasibility of using xxxxxx proprietary microphone array signal processing and robust ASR technologies was validated. In particular, it was found that novel multichannel noise reduction produces larger gain in SNR than conventional beamforming but the latter is more preferable as far as ASR is concerned. In addition, it was confirmed that the model adaptation algorithm can make an ASR system more robust inside spacesuits. An arithmetic complexity model for ASR was developed. It can direct the decision as to whether a specified speech interface is sufficiently efficient to be possibly implemented with a wearable system. xxxxxx will analyze and minimize the scientific and engineering uncertainties identified during xxxxxx, a voice command interface for future generations of a suit's processing system is proposed to be developed on DSP chips. The system should be ready for testing and use by xxxxxx suited crewmembers at the end of xxxxxx.	15577

X-Ray Diffraction and Fluorescence Instrument for Mineralogical Analysis at the Lunar Surface, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop a compact and lightweight xxxxxx Diffraction (xxxxxx (XRF) instrument for analysis of mineralogicalcomposition of regolith, rock samples and dust, in lunar surfaceexploration.   The instrument inherits from the general concept ofCheMin, the xxxxxx/XRF instrument of MSL, but is entirely redesigned toprovide a more compact and lightweight unit, and reduced costs.   Manyimplementation details of the proposed instrument will inherit from thedesign of a small portable xxxxxx/XRF instruments developed and marketed byinXitu, xxxxxx. and a robotic instrument derived from this design. Theobjective of this proposal is to bring this development to a high xxxxxx of6 to 7, to enable fast and cost effective development of subsequentflight systems.  A high xxxxxx target is possible within the scope of anxxxxxx xxxxxx I + II because several key technological developmentsrequired for this objective have been or are being- addressed by thecompany through separate sources of funding.

Single-Aperture GPS-based Attitude (GPS/A) Sensor for Spin-Stabilized Platforms, Phase II	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Attitude determination of spin-stabilized platforms is especially challenging. Current low-cost gyroscope technology does not lend itself to attitude determination of platforms spinning in excess of one rotation per second. Traditional GPS-based attitude (GPS/A) sensors require three or more antenna elements separated by large baselines. Single-element designs require extensive calibration of the satellite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and are not very accurate. xxxxxx xxxxxxearch Corporation proposes to develop a small, single-aperture low-cost GPS/A sensor for space launch vehicles, and to demonstrate the sensor in an operational environment. The sensor determines the platform attitude with a single GPS antenna having a diameter of approximately 6.5 cm. The standalone performance of xxxxxx's GPS/A sensor on a spinning platform is better than 2.1 degrees for roll, and better than 1.2 degrees for yaw and pitch (one-sigma). The system performance can be further improved when integrated with accelerometers and/or magnetometers. xxxxxxhough current low-cost gyroscope technology does not allow their use on spinning platforms, non-spinning platforms may take advantage of gyro measurements for further improvements in attitude performance. During the proposed xxxxxx program xxxxxx will develop, build and test a prototype system that will be delivered for validation onboard an actual space launch vehicle.	15588
GPU Accelerated Ultrasonic Guided Wave Simulation Toolbox (UGW-Sim) for Virtual Inspection of Complex Aerospace Structures, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxxsonic guided waves are being used as a NDE/SHM technique to detect flaws and damage in fracture critical structures such as aerospace structures. xxxxxxver, due to the complexity associated with the waveguide problem, direct interpretation of large amount of NDE/SHM data is difficult. A rapid and accurate simulation tool is needed to keep up with the demand automated and timely detection and assessment of damages in complex aerospace structures. We propose to develop a \"virtual inspection\" simulation toolbox (UGW-Sim) specifically for ultrasonic guided waves. This tool will be able to help analyze and interpret ultrasonic guided wave signals obtained from NDE/SHM measurements for damage detection and identification. It will include modeling of critical structural components such as stiffener and bonded joints and various types of damages that are commonly encountered. The tool will also help determine the optimal sensor placement and inspection parameters to maximize the detectability of various damages. xxxxxx I will focus on the feasibility demonstration of the approach on metal structures and simple defects. xxxxxx will fully develop the software tool and extend to composite material with complex geometries and defect types."	15589

Model Annotations and Tools for Teamwork, Execution, and Reuse (MATTER), Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	In order to carry out space-based science missions, xxxxxx is responsible for designing, developing, and operating very complex, long-lived, and expensive systems.  xxxxxxy investment in analyzing a wide range of options can produce markedly better designs.  That means pervasive modeling and simulation (M&S) early in conceptual design could pay large dividends for xxxxxx, especially if M&S were cheaper to carry out, and if resulting models could be exploited throughout and across projects.We propose to develop xxxxxx Annotations and xxxxxx for xxxxxxwork, Execution, and Reuse (MATTER).  This innovative technology will increase the efficiency and value of model-based systems engineering (MBSE).  MATTER will improve on existing SysML-based MBSE by defining new types of metadata that enable valuable processing capabilities not supported by the standard SysML language and existing tools: (1) Semantic descriptions capturing the intended uses of model fragments will encourage reuse, when combined with tools for managing and searching a model library; (2) Additional descriptions of model component interfaces will enable efficient composition and configuration of models; (3) Annotations on the behaviors and constraints of model elements will ease automation of simulation generation and analysis; (4) Tracking of model changes--including version branches representing alternate designs--will facilitate flexible trade analysis, model continuity and evolution across the project lifecycle, and teamwork; and (5) xxxxxxration and routing of change notifications will further coordinate team efforts, as awareness of shifts in inputs or the irrelevance of intended outputs will reduce wasted work.During this project, we will design the system and develop a software prototype that illustrates the feasibility and utility of this approach.	15591
Advanced Vortex Hybrid Rocket Engine (AVHRE), Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx Technologies Corporation (ORBITEC) proposes to develop a unique xxxxxxanced xxxxxx Hybrid xxxxxx Engine (AVHRE) to achieve a highly-reliable, low-cost and extremely versatile propulsion technology.  The benefits of AVHRE result from the combination of ORBITEC's patented vortex injection technique; high-regression rate, paraffin solid fuels; and a new fuel formulation innovation to control the solid fuel regression characteristics and provide improved structural integrity of the grain.  A vortex injector generates a coaxial vortex pair, driving high solid-fuel regression rates and improved combustion efficiency.  In addition, paraffin also regresses very rapidly, further enhancing the systems flexibility.  The rapid regression rates and many design degrees of freedom offered by AVHRE offers the potential for: (1) increased propellant mass fractions; (2) the ability to tailor and optimize a hybrid propulsion system for a specific application; (3) increased ISP efficiency; (4) a reduction or elimination of residual fuel; (5) improved grain structural integrity and increased melting temperature; (6) reduced need for thermal insulation.  xxxxxx I will demonstrate the feasibility and merit of AVHRE through design, analysis, laboratory testing, and hot firings of up to 1,000 lbf thrust.	15592

SiC Matrix Composites for High Temperature Hypersonic Vehicle Applications, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Durable high temperature materials are required for hypersonic engine and structural thermal protection systems.  In particular, 2700ºF or greater capable structural materials that can survive stresses on the order of 10 ksi (70 MPa) for at least 100 hours in an oxidizing environment have been identified as an enabling material for future hypersonic vehicles with a long term desired target of 3000ºF.  As these applications are structural, a strong degree of damage tolerance is desired, and thus ceramic matrix composites are the primary choice due to the desire for reduced weight, high temperature strength and oxidation resistance. xxxxxx carbide fiber-reinforced silicon carbide matrix (xxxxxx/xxxxxx) composites are believed to be the most suitable solution due to meeting the requirements with the exception of creep at the highest temperatures/loads. The proposed effort will modify the xxxxxx fiber preform by the addition of a fraction of more creep resistant carbon fibers.  The xxxxxx I will encompass engineering the appropriate level of hybridization in a C-xxxxxx/xxxxxx composite, producing and evaluating the ceramic composite material for hypersonic vehicle applications, including stress rupture at temperatures of 2700ºF or greater.	15595
Laser Stethoscope for Use in Noisy Spacecraft Environments, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Auscultation, or listening to internal sounds made by the body of a patient, is an important tool in medical diagnostics.  Heart, lung, intestine, and circulatory function can be assessed through careful listening.  There are numerous situations, however, where the faint sounds collected using an ordinary stethoscope are overwhelmed by ambient noise.  Such is the case in spacecraft, where room is scarce and noise generating equipment is always nearby.  Here, a stethoscope employing laser xxxxxx vibrometry is proposed.  Through an innovative design employing adaptive filtering, the new-technology stethoscope will provide immunity to external noise while providing conventional auscultation sounds for easy interpretation by medical professionals.  xxxxxx I and xxxxxx development will result in a system that is lightweight, rugged, efficient, and compact, making it suitable for use in space.  The system will provide enhanced medical care for astronauts in space, allowing auscultation sounds to be transmitted back to mission control medical personnel despite the high levels of ambient noise present in the spacecraft.	15596

Visible-Light-Responsive Catalyst Development for Volatile Organic Carbon Remediation	2016-04-01	2018-07-19	Photocatalysis is a process in which light energy is used to &lsquo;activate&rsquo; oxidation/reduction reactions. Unmodified titanium dioxide (TiO2), a common photocatalyst, requires high-energy UV light for&nbsp; activation due to its large band gap (3.2 eV). xxxxxxfication of TiO2 can reduce this band gap, leading to visible-light-responsive (VLR) photocatalysts. These catalysts can utilize solar and/or visible wavelength LED lamps as an activation source, replacing mercury-containing UV lamps, to create a &ldquo;greener,&rdquo; more energy-efficient means for air and water revitalization. Recently, KSC developed several VLR catalysts that, on preliminary evaluation, possessed high catalytic activity within the visible spectrum; these samples out-performed existing commercial VLR catalysts.Project Goals:xxxxxx rugged reactor test bed for catalyst testing with exchangeable light sources.xxxxxx-developed VLR-catalysts to treat recalcitrant trace contaminants found in closed-loop air systems such as xxxxxx.xxxxxxance xxxxxx to align with AES goals for FY16/17 scale-up testing. The knowledge gained from this research will inform continued advancements in trace contaminant control. The research will provide insight on the ability to utilize visible-light-induced photocatalysis for the safe removal of volatile organic chemicals. This project will advance a much needed remediation technology, throught the following tasks:Task 1: xxxxxxment of reactor test bed and LED array.xxxxxxfication and development of a current catalyst test bed including rugged reactor design and in-line monitoring of contaminants to determine photocatalytic activity.xxxxxxment of a visible wavelength LED array for comparison of light source choice in experiments.Task 2: xxxxxximization and testing of top-performing catalysts.&nbsp;xxxxxximization of catalyst formula and immobilization techniques for catalyst evaluation.Completion of catalyst evaluation including ability to degrade multiple challenge contaminants, catalyst lifetime, etc.Evaluation of effective light sources for photocatalytic work to achieve independence from Hg-containing lamps.Task 3: xxxxxxical characterization of catalysts.&nbsp;xxxxxx of physical characteristics including, but not limited to, XPS, diffuse reflectance, BET surface area, SEM, etc.Task 4: Evaluation of technology for validation in relevant environments such as HISEAS or similar.	15598
A Space-Qualified Single Frequency Fiber Laser for LISA, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	Single frequency high power lasers have been considered to be an enabling technology for xxxxxx xxxxxx Interferometer xxxxxx xxxxxx (xxxxxx). PolarOnyx proposes, for the first time, an ultra low noise high power (> 1W, scalable to 10W) single frequency (< 1 KHz) fiber laser source to meet with the requirement of solicitation. It is a specialty fiber based MOPA. The mode selection in seed laser is achieved by using a fiber based ultra narrow bandpass filter. The side mode suppression ratio can thus be suppressed over 80 dB. In the amplifier stage, our unique spectral shaping technology enables us to reduce the SBS and ASE noise significantly by using a commercially available YDF and reuse the residual pump to further increase the efficiency. Radiation hardness will be intensively studied in selection of space qualified fibers and components. A tabletop experiment will be demonstrated in xxxxxx I time frame for proof of concept. A compact prototype will be delivered in xxxxxx meeting major space qualification such as radiation hardness.	15599
Interface Anywhere	2012-08-01	2018-07-19	"Current paradigms for crew interfaces to the systems that require control are constrained by decades old technologies which require the crew to be physically near an input device to interact with the system.   Often this requires an interruption to move to a specific worksite which has a keyboard and/or the device they need to interact with.   This project demonstrated it is possible and practical to use a combination of voice and gesture to control systems while greatly enhancing the range of locations the user can operate the system from.  Evaluation feedback from engineering peers echoed our thoughts on the possibilities for these control modalities, but more importantly, offered critical feedback on what they perceived as intuitive voice and gestures and also emphasized the need for improved reliability.   Ultimately this project established a basis for identifying areas for further investigation in order to design a natural user interface that offers inherently reliable system control and has stimulated interest and participation from multiple academic institutions.To illustrate the viability of this technology, a prototype xxxxxxural xxxxxx (NUI) was developed as a proof-of-concept for system control.  Gesture and voice controls were developed and compared.   Both methods of control input allowed the user to be in a general area as opposed to a specific location.   Voice input highlighted the ability to achieve truly hands-free interaction. The prototype provided for control of a simplistic lighting system and cabin temperature control system which represented a typical space habitat system requiring interaction.  The user interacted with the system through a xxxxxxsoft xxxxxx sensor which includes an infrared light source and receiver and array microphone capability.   Code was developed in conjunction with the skeleton tracking and speech recognition capabilities in the software development kit to allow the use of gestures and speech as a source of input.  To allow the user to monitor system response and to 'see' the results of their commands, a simple set of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) were developed to include the logical equivalent of commands and telemetry feedback.   In addition, an end effector unit was developed using an Arduino microprocessor which received serial port inputs from the application software to control light emitting diodes which represented habitat light systems and a servo motor which represented an air mixing valve that might be used to support temperature control setpoint.   To interact with the system, the user began with a main display where they could navigate to the lighting controls display and a thermal control display.  The lighting controls consisted of on-off buttons for three areas of the simulated habitat (lab, crew quarters, airlock). Using voice commanding, the user could control the lights in each habitation area (e.g., \"lab off\" would select the off button). Gesture control employed both the left and right arms. Once the participant told the system to track their arm, a focus box would move over the lighting controls as controlled by the left hand. Once the focus box was over the desired on-off control, the button would be activated by a wave of the right hand. On the thermal control screen, a slider was shown with setpoint values ranging from 62 and 82 degrees. Using simple voice commands such as \"temp 70\", the setpoint indicator would move to that temperature. When the participant told the system to track the hand, the slider would move in parallel with the right hand. To stay at a specific temperature, the participant simply told the system to stop tracking.   The appropriate lights on the end-effector unit would turn on/off consistent with the GUI indications and the servo would move to a position in its range of motion that was scaled to be consistent with the temperature setpoint command. xxxxxxment, test and evaluation of this small system emphasized the importance of designing it in a way that ensures the actions the system takes are consistent with the intent of the user and that the application software contains logic necessary to correctly interpret the sensed inputs.   This is particularly challenging to accomplish while trying to ensure that the gestures and voice commands remain natural and easily remembered/applied.   It was also important to allow the user to enable/disable the processing of voice/gesture at any given time during use. Through this project we have identified the need to investigate and develop gesture and voice 'vocabularies' that will be perceived as natural and easily remembered by users.   We have also determined that design approaches using mode control are relevant but require additional considerations when using one or more NUI input modalities.   xxxxxxively more complex system development would be the best approach to mature the design practices required for spacecraft application.  It is understood that other options exist for NUI input sensing which may be preferable for certain applications.   xxxxxxver, it is believed that this forward work  would apply to alternate NUI input sensing options as well."	15600

The proposed xxxxxx xxxxxx program is aimed at developing new cryogenic insulations for passive thermal control, resulting in zero boil-off storage of cryogens.

Nephelometric Dropsonde for Volcanic Ash, Phase I	2011-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxanced dropsondes that could effectively be guided through atmospheric regions of interest such as volcanic plumes could enable unprecedented observations of important atmospheric phenomena. xxxxxxovative Dynamics, xxxxxx. proposes to develop a flight ready optical sensor package to provide hazardous volcanic ash and particulate information within commercial airspace.  The probe will initially be used as a dropsonde from a UAV but eventually be carried by all aircraft. This volcanic ash particulate information would then be incorporated into standard E-PIREP reports as well as distributed via air traffic controllers. The innovation is a new capability for making in-situ measurement of cloud particulates to improve pilot awareness of hazardous operating conditions, such as those recently experienced by aircraft engines operating in the xxxxxx Atlantic near xxxxxx.  xxxxxx and xxxxxx particulate information is currently obtained by positioning a satellite to a location, produces limited data, and is cost prohibitive.IDI proposes to develop a flight deployable optical probe which will determine various airborne  particulates such as volcanic ash particle size and density.

Task Allocation Using Continuous Resource Distributed Markov Decision Processes	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	Exploration of other planets will require teams of robotic rovers to first precede and later assist human explorers. A critical challenge will then be to generate plans for these rovers so as to maximize their productivity while minimizing the time and energy spent to complete a set of tasks. The tasks assigned to an agent may feature temporal constraints as well as complex interdependencies with other tasks, including those assigned to another agent. Numerous techniques have been developed to efficiently compute policies for a single agent using continuous resource xxxxxx Decision xxxxxx (CR-MDP). xxxxxxver, expanding such algorithms to situations involving multiple agents is difficult, given that the complexity of solving decentralized xxxxxx Decision xxxxxx (DEC-MDPs) has been shown to be NEXP-complete. Even when using approximate algorithms, it is difficult to achieve the scale-up necessary to model the size and complexity of real-world domains using distributed CR-MDPs (CR-DEC-MDP). I intend to explore methods for solving CR-DEC-MDPs more efficiently, including (1) fast, locally optimal methods that exploit domain structure; and (2) efficient methods of convolution using fast xxxxxx transform (FFT).	15606

Low Power Digital Correlator System for PATH Mission, Phase II	2017-09-01	2018-07-19	"The xxxxxx xxxxxx mission employs xxxxxx spectral radiometer processing data from antenna consisting of three arms, each holding 128 microwave receivers. Each of the 384 receivers amplifies RF signals, and down-converts them to an intermediate frequency (IF). As a result, 768 in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signals are produced with a frequency of 10 to 500MHz. The IF signals have to be normalized and digitized with 1Gs/s sampling rate for further cross-correlation. Each signal from one arm of the receiver must be cross-correlated with all signals from the other two arms, therefore a system containing 196,000 parallel cross-correlation blocks is needed. Since the xxxxxx is a space born instrument, low power dissipation and ensuring system reliability, through processing redundancy, are one of the most important requirements. A system assembled by using off-the-shelf components would be extremely power inefficient, bulky, and unreliable. Therefore, a system that is based on application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) is required. While working on the xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx project \"Low xxxxxx Cross-Correlator ASIC\" (NNX13CP01C), Pacific xxxxxxchip Corp. has developed and fabricated  an ASIC that includes 128-element array of 2-bit 1GS/s ADCs, and 4096 parallel cross-correlation cells. The ASIC was designed based on the xxxxxx radiometer requirements, therefore it is intended to be the key component in the cross-correlator system which is being developed. The system will contain means correlation results further post-processing and control of ASICs."	15608
Design Automation Algorithm for Soft Robots	2017-08-01	2018-07-19	The majority of design to manufacturing today is still an ad hoc and empirical process. There is a direct need for a single, automated design and fabrication process. Furthermore, new fabrication techniques at the micro and macro scales provide nearly unlimited design and product potential, for which there is no design precedent. Empirical design will not transfer to the projects that are capable of being produced with these techniques (or example, mobile soft robots), because human intuition will fail when trying to predict the performance of non-linear interactions between novel materials and forms at multiple scales.I propose that xxxxxx (EAs) are used to iteratively and interactively produce designs. EAs mimic the traits of biological evolution and apply them to artificial design of novel and unintuitive solutions. They have been shown to create complex and interesting forms with interactive feedback from a human user, and also have been shown to create high performing solutions when left to optimize product design towards one or more objective feature. xxxxxx of EA performance include a part deployed on the xxxxxx ST5 spacecraft which outperformed all of the alternative human designed solutions or specialized crumple zones in industry leading automobiles.The universal design tool I propose will take advantage of computational precision and speed to create an array of high performing designs, then take advantage of a user's human intuition to judge and select designs according to intuitive properties that the computer cannot compute on its own (e.g. designs that are novel, interesting, attractive, or promising). The fact that different pressures are shaping the design from different systems (the user's preferences and the computer's performance metric) will overcome many of the problems with local optima and lack of diversity that EAs have faced in the past. Additionally, recent work has shown that the use of drivers such as interestingness or novelty can be more effective drivers of EAs than a direct performance metric. The iterative design process of an EA means that there is always a functionally viable, fully described, design that is being optimized. Thus at any point in time, the best current design can be sent to a 3D printer for immediate fabrication. This design tool would contain properties such as: Immediate and individualized fabrication potential of current designs; xxxxxx of need for domain specific knowledge or for full intuition of the (usually non-linear) constraints and processes occurring (and being optimized) at multiple scales; And the sole requirements of a high level performance metric and general human intuition. These make this system ideal for design optimization at any scale - whether it be as large and rigorous as a xxxxxx spacecraft or as quick and simple as a cleaning robot at home or a load bearing frame at an industrial job site. Additionally, since the design process is iterative and based off of rigorous simulation and validation from a performance model, all products that come out of this system will have a digital twin - a simulated version upon which additional tests, circumstances, or project mirroring can take place.	15609

Optimizing a Two-Step Laser Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer for In Situ Astrobiology Investigations	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	The search for the presence of extant or extinct life on any planetary surface outside of Earth's biosphere begins with the identification and characterization of biosignatures within geologic samples. I will identify the spectral characteristics of amino acids and other chains of basic organic compounds essential to life on Earth for use as analogs for the identification of extraterrestrial biosignatures. There are relatively few geologic samples of other planetary surfaces available to us on Earth, requiring most data acquisition to be performed in situ. Cost and engineering constraints placed on lander-based scientific instruments require these instruments to be compact, low-power, and environmentally versatile.I propose to test and optimize a two-step laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometer (L2MS) for organic and biosignature identification. I will test several desorption and ionization laser configurations on a suite of organic and inorganic sample classes to build the phase space of the optimal L2MS laser configurations. I will also apply several statistical algorithms to the data obtained with the L2MS and existing, complementary instrumentation available at NMSU, including IR and UV reflectance spectrometers and a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument to quantify the effectiveness of these instruments as biomarker identification tools and exploit the unique mineralogical and astrobiological results each instrument contributes.The L2MS operates by first desorbing material on a sample surface using a pulsed IR laser, and subsequently ionizing the analyte using a pulsed UV laser directed orthogonally to the IR laser. The desorbing laser pulse generates a neutral plume of analyte from a solid sample. After a tunable delay, the ionizing laser pulse intersects the neutral plume above the sample surface. When the laser energy exceeds a threshold value, ions are generated in the plume and accelerated into the instrument for mass analysis. I will determine the ideal desorbing and ionizing laser configurations by finding the optimal laser wavelengths, timing between desorption and ionization of the neutral plume, and geometric position of the ionizing laser relative to the desorption laser. The optimized L2MS configuration will be dependent on the molecular structure of the organic sample, and in order to reduce excessive fragmentation, I will determine the optimal configuration for several sample classes including synthetic PAHs, amino acids, nucleobases, peptides, and naturally occurring organics within field samples.The xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxents, Observatories, and xxxxxx xxxxxxs xxxxxx requires technological advancements in biological detection and characterization to achieve a ppb sensitivity and an in situ characterization of organic materials, and advancing the aforementioned technologies will ensure xxxxxx continued leadership in these areas. The completion of this project will address these xxxxxx technology and astrobiology roadmap objectives through the development and optimization of the L2MS instrument, exploring the detection capabilities of the L2MS on a broad, systematic sample suite, and determining how results from several spectrometer instruments can be used to inform the laser configuration of the L2MS. This high priority, innovative technology development will create new capabilities for future xxxxxx missions.	15611

The sensor consistsof a software-defined radar transceiver, compact dual-polarized arrayantenna operating in the X-band as well as an integrated RF analogfront-end. By leveraging dual-polarization processing, the system willbe able to extract atmospheric parameters; thus it will be able toidentify and classify the atmospheric conditions as well as localobscurants. The software defined radar transceiver has a Direct DigitalSynthesis (DDS) component which can easily generate high bandwidth chirpwaveforms (bandwidth &gt;=200 MHz) and pulse shaping can be defineddigitally to reduce the side-lobes considerably.  IAI is currentlydeveloping a software defined radar (SDR) platform that can adaptivelyswitch between different modes of operation for radar, by modifying bothtransmit waveforms and receive signal-processing tasks on the fly.  Theproposed multi-channel radar technique and the system design willleverage IAI's vast experience in SDR, RF hardware design and antennadesign and OU's capabilities in microwave design and field-provenatmospheric hazard modeling and detection algorithm development.	15612

Advanced Technology Cloud Particle Probe for UAS, Phase II	2012-12-01	2018-07-19	In xxxxxx SPEC will design, fabricate and flight test a state-of-the-art combined cloud particle probe called the xxxxxx.  xxxxxx is the culmination of two decades of innovative instrument development at SPEC. The new probe will measure the size distribution of cloud and precipitation particles, provide high-resolution (2.3 micron pixel) images of cloud particles and remove artifacts from ice particle shattering.  This will be accomplished by eclectic combination of technology developed in three existing SPEC optical cloud particle probes:  1) A fast FSSP, that measures size distributions from 1 to 50 microns and records individual particle statistics and remove shattered particles using inter-arrival times, 2) a cloud particle imager (CPI) with upgraded imagery capable of recording up to 500 frames per second, and 3) a 2D-S (xxxxxx) probe that is configured with one channel to provide full-view images of particles from 10 microns to 1.28 mm, and a second channel configured to provide full-view images of particles from 50 microns to 6.4 mm.  Thus, using particle dimensions along the direction of flight will produce particle size distributions from 1 micron to several cm. xxxxxx will be designed for installation and autonomous (unattended) operation on xxxxxx research aircraft, including the xxxxxx Hawk unmanned aerial system (UAS), and DC-8, WB-57F and ER-2 piloted research aircraft.  xxxxxx will provide vastly improved measurements of particle and precipitation size distributions, particle shape, extinction coefficient, effective particle radius, ice water content and equivalent radar reflectivity.  xxxxxx will be ready for installation on xxxxxx aircraft for the upcoming ACE and xxxxxx decadal missions, which are aimed at measurements of the effects of aerosols, clouds and precipitation on global climate change.	15614

Solving a prisoner's dilemma in distributed anomaly detection	2010-09-10	2018-07-19	xxxxxx detection has recently become an important problem in many industrial and financial applications. In several instances, the data to be analyzed for possible anomalies is located at multiple sites and cannot be merged due to practical constraints such as bandwidth limitations and proprietary concerns. At the same time, the size of data sets affects prediction quality in almost all data mining applications. In such circumstances, distributed data mining algorithms may be used to extract information from multiple data sites in order to make better predictions. In the absence of theoretical guarantees, however, the degree to which data decentralization affects the performance of these algorithms is not known, which reduces the data providing participants' incentive to cooperate.This creates a metaphorical 'prisoners' dilemma' in the context of data mining. In this work, we propose a novel general framework for distributed anomaly detection with theoretical performance guarantees. Our algorithmic approach combines existing anomaly detection procedures with a novel method for computing global statistics using local sufficient statistics. We show that the performance of such a distributed approach is indistinguishable from that of a centralized instantiation of the same anomaly detection algorithm, a condition that we call zero information loss. We further report experimental results on synthetic as well as real-world data to demonstrate the viability of our approach. The remaining content of this presentation is presented in xxxxxx. 1.	15616
MESSENGER H XRS 5 REDUCED DATA RECORD                                      (RDR) FOOTPRINTS V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	Abstract ======== This data set consists of the MESSENGER XRS reduced data record (xxxxxx) footprints which are derived from the navigational meta-data for each calibrated data record (CDR) whose FOV_STATUS is 1 or 3; that is, when the field of view intersects the planet and is either partially or entirely sunlit. Each XRS observation results in four X-ray spectra. When an X-ray interacts with one of the four detectors, a charge or voltage pulse is generated. This signal is converted into one of 2^8 (256) channels, which are correlated to energy. Over a commanded integration time period a histogram of counts as a function of energy (channel number) is recorded. The EDRs are the number of events in each channel of the four detectors accumulated over the integration period. Channels above or below the useful energy range of the detectors are not transmitted. The result is three 244-channel GPC histograms and one 231-channel solar monitor histogram, each of which is designated as a single X-ray spectrum. Each observation is calibrated and processed into the CDR data set. For each CDR whose field of view is contained or partially contained on the planetary surface, a footprint is computed that corresponds to the perimeter of the planetary region within the instrument field of view during the integration time of the observation.	15617
Lightweight Low Force Rotary Percussive Coring Tool for Planetary Applications, Phase II	2009-11-01	2018-07-19	Alliance xxxxxxsystems, LLC produced a rotary percussive drill designed for space use under a xxxxxx-funded xxxxxx xxxxxxent xxxxxxment Program (MIDP) project -- the Low-force Sample Acquisition xxxxxx (LSAS). The flight-like drill prototype that was the end result of the project successfully drilled and acquired 1 cm³ samples from a variety of rocks and soils including the hardest anticipated xxxxxx rock (basalt) and frozen soil. This ability was demonstrated not only in ambient conditions but also in a thermal/vacuum chamber replicating xxxxxx pressure and extreme temperatures. The rotary percussive approach is simple, robust, and highly efficient with regards to power and mass.During the xxxxxx 2006 xxxxxx I effort, Alliance took this heritage device and expanded its potential to include coring against a variety of rock materials anticipated to be encountered on xxxxxx. Through the use of a breadboard fixture, coring bit designs and coring parameters were evaluated to identify optimum combinations. At the completion of test a conceptual design was generated taking this coring experience into account and adding core retention, break and ejection features. A bit change mechanism, identified as a requirement for successful operation while maintaining design robustness and simplicity, was added as well.A xxxxxx effort is now proposed that will take this conceptual design into prototype form. Primary activities to be performed during xxxxxx will include:•Additional coring test runs to work out final details of detail bit design•Detail design and prototyping of core handling mechanisms•Prototype testing of core handling mechanisms•Design and manufacture of full prototype LSAS xxxxxx system•xxxxxx of prototype LSAS corer•xxxxxxtion of LSAS corer onto robotic platform and functional demonstration	15618

VG2 URA PWS RAW EXPERIMENT WAVEFORM 60MS V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	This data set consists of electric field waveform samples from the Voyager 2 xxxxxx Wave xxxxxx waveform receiver obtained during the xxxxxx encounter. The waveforms are collections of 4-bit samples of the electric field measured by the dipole electric antenna at a rate of 28,800 samples per second. 1600 samples are collected in 55.56 msec followed by a 4.44-msec gap. Each 60-msec interval constitutes a line of waveform samples. The data set includes about 271 frames of waveform samples consisting of up to 800 lines, each. The telemetry format for the waveform data is identical to that for images, hence the use of line and frame as constructs in describing the form of the data. The waveform is sampled through a bandpass filter with a passband of 40 Hz to 12 kHz. The 4-bit samples provide sixteen digital values of the electric field with a linear amplitude scale, but the amplitude scale is arbitrary because of the automatic gain control used in the waveform receiver. The instantaneous dynamic range afforded by the 4 bit samples is about 23 db, but the automatic gain control allows the dominant signal in the passband to be set at the optimum level to fit within the instantaneous dynamic range. With the gain control, the overall dynamic range of the waveform receiver is about 100 db. The automatic gain control gain setting is not returned to the ground, hence, there is no absolute calibration for the data. xxxxxxver, by comparing the waveform spectrum derived by xxxxxx transforming the waveform to the spectrum provided by the spectrum analyzer data, an absolute calibration may be obtained in most cases. The data may be plotted in raw form to show the actual waveform useful for studying events such as dust impacts on the spacecraft. But the normal method of analyzing the waveform data is by xxxxxx transforming the samples from each line to arrive at an amplitude versus frequency spectrum. By stacking the spectra side-by-side in time order, a frequency- time spectrogram can be produced. Additional information about this dataset and the instrument which produced it can be found elsewhere in this catalog. An overview of the data in this data set can be found in xxxxxx. [1986] and a complete instrument description can be found in Scarf and xxxxxx [1977].	15625

High Energy Single Frequency Resonant Amplifier, Phase I	2011-08-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx phase I project proposes a single frequency high energyresonant amplifier for remote sensing. Current state-of-art technologiescan not provide all features of high energy and efficiency, compactness,and narrow spectral width. PolarOnyx proposes, for the first time, ahigh energy (100 mJ) resonant amplifier to meet with the requirement ofsolicitation. This proposal is based on the spectral shaping sub-mJfiber laser at 1550 nm we have achieved in our labs.  In the high poweramplifier stage, PolarOnyx proposes an innovative resonant cavity basedamplifier approach by employing our patent pending proprietarytechnologies in hybrid high energy amplifiers, that will be able tooperate at low repetition rate (10's Hz to 1 kHz) and reach high energylevel of 100 mJ. These will make the hybrid fiber laser transmittersystem superior in terms of wall plug efficiency (over 30&#37;), energy(100mJ), noise, size, and cost.  A tabletop experiment will be demonstratedin xxxxxx I time frame for proof of concept. A compact prototype will bedelivered in xxxxxx.	15628
VG1 J/S/SS PLASMA WAVE SPECTROMETER RAW WAVEFORM 60MS V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	The Voyager 1 xxxxxx Wave xxxxxx (PWS) raw full resolution data set consists of electric field waveform samples from the Voyager 1 xxxxxx Wave xxxxxxsystem waveform receiver obtained during the entire mission. xxxxxx will continue to be added to the archive on subsequent volumes. The data set encompasses all waveform observations obtained in the cruise mission phases before, between, and after the xxxxxx and xxxxxx encounter phases as well as those obtained during the two encounter phases. xxxxxx for this data set are acquired from the PWS waveform receiver. xxxxxx are presented as time series of 4-bit voltage measurements acquired at the rate of 28,800 samples per second through a 40 Hz to 12 kHz bandpass filter. An automatic gain control is used to keep the signal within the usable range of the 4-bit digitization, however, the gain information is not returned to the ground, hence, there is no direct, absolute calibration. xxxxxxver, a power spectrum analysis returns a spectrum that has accurate relative amplitudes between spectral elements. This data set provides the highest temporal resolution data from the Voyager mission. A browse data set is included with these data which provides for a graphical search of the data using a series of thumbnail and full-sized spectrograms which lead the user to the particular data file(s) of interest.	15629
Close Proximity Robotic Maneuvering through Flux Pinning Manipulation	2019-08-01	2018-07-19	Non-contacting actuation technology like flux pinning has never been demonstrated in space. The development of a nonphysical joint is critical for maneuvers such as docking, rendezvous, and in-orbit assembly (xxxxxx xxxxxx 4: robotics, tele-robotics and autonomous systems).xxxxxx pinning is not well characterized for interactions that involve all six rigid-body degree of freedoms. My research will focus on developing a better mathematical model and constructing a spaceflight system to demonstrate prolonged flux pinning interactions.I will develop this model to show that flux pinning is robust enough to overcome environmental torques and magnetic field disturbances, given well simulated, tested, and robust control algorithms and system architectures (xxxxxx, xxxxxx Readiness xxxxxx 4). I will then construct a test environment to iteratively validate the theoretical model and demonstrate dynamic manipulation (xxxxxx). To prove that this will be feasible in space missions, I will develop fully integrated xxxxxx to perform maneuvers on these testbeds (xxxxxx 7).A successful space flight demonstration of flux pinned system will give way to a completely new kind of space proven joint. xxxxxx would no longer need to be assembled on the ground in bulky, awkward shapes. xxxxxxs of flux pinned components could be easily replaced with another or autonomously repaired in orbit with minimal effect on the entire system. The xxxxxx telescope was launched out of focus, requiring millions of dollars to train astronauts and launch a crew to refocus the mirrors. This is a distinct example of the advantages to in-orbit assembly/adjustment. Instead of risky spacewalks with skilled astronauts, the skewed mirrors of the telescope could have been adjusted and finely tuned by commanding the modular pieces from the ground. xxxxxx require cold environments (80 K) which pairs well with flux pinning requirements. xxxxxx pinned satellites could also function like the research racks on the xxxxxx, but mounting to the outside environment. Small contained experiments could easily be swapped out, without the involved installation and take-down period requiring risky spacewalks and valuable astronaut time.	15630

Hybrid Computational Model for High-Altitude Aeroassist Vehicles, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	A hybrid continuum/noncontinuum computational model will be developed for analyzing the aerodynamics and heating on aeroassist vehicles.  xxxxxx features of this model include (1) the ability to model rarefied flows with localized continuum features at high altitudes, (2) the ability to model both ablative and non-ablative thermal protection systems, and (3) the ability to model multiple firings of reaction control jets.  The model will permit analyzing high-speed, nonequilibrium flows about entry and aeroassist vehicles based on extensions to three-dimensional xxxxxx and Direct Simulation xxxxxx (xxxxxx) codes.  Extension will include effects of liquid and solid particulates along with gaseous species, which should significantly enhance the ability to analyze complex ablation effects.  The coupling of these tools to include modeling of multiple reaction-control-jet firings will provide essential data for assessing the aerothermodynamic performance for a wide range of vehicle designs over a wide range of vehicle altitudes and flight conditions.  The improved accuracy offered by our proposed hybrid modeling approach offers significant benefits in the design of vehicles for both unmanned planetary missions and manned missions to the xxxxxx and xxxxxx.	15632
High Power, Thermally Optimized Blue Laser for Lidar, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	To enable widespread and rapid airborne bathymetric lidar to adequate depths in many ocean regions a low-cost, rugged, and high energy pulsed laser source must be developed in the ocean water transmittance spectrum of 450 - 490 nm. The ideal laser source will be high performance for lidar (high pulse energy, high rep rate, short pulse duration) with specific targeted emission spectrum to meet ocean water transmittance and filtering requirements. It will also feature low SWaP and a rugged form factor with high reliability for continual use on mobile platforms. No existing laser source can meet these demanding requirements.To address this challenge and meet xxxxxx lidar source needs, xxxxxx Photonics, xxxxxx. (xxxxxx) proposes creating a high power Q-switched, off-line xxxxxxYAG source at 946 nm, which, when frequency doubled to 473 nm, will provide high transmittance through ocean waters. xxxxxx's design will leverage three key innovations proven out in its xxxxxx I effort: efficient, end-pumped, low-quantum-defect architecture; gain crystal design for optimal heat removal; and robust monolithic, alignment-free fabrication. The proposed design would allow for widespread deployment of mobile ocean-penetrating lidar transmitters.  Successful completion of this xxxxxx effort will allow xxxxxx to demonstrate >10 W of average blue power in a compact, turn-key package. xxxxxx has modeled and constructed similar lasers through xxxxxx efforts previously and will apply the innovations developed there towards this new system for xxxxxx.	15633
Development of Optics and Detectors for Advanced CMB Polarization Measurements	2017-08-01	2018-07-19	Measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have been essential to the development of modern cosmology. Future observations will provide cosmological constraints from structure formation as well as improved characterization of inflation in the early universe.  xxxxxxing in 2008, the Atacama Cosmology xxxxxx (xxxxxx) measured the CMB temperature on arcminute scales, discovered galaxy clusters through the xxxxxxyaev-Zeldovich effect, and when combined with measurements from xxxxxx WMAP satellite provided evidence for the existence of dark energy for the first time using CMB measurements alone.  With this NSTRF fellowship I plan to work towards the development of optics and detector technologies for a next generation instrument to be deployed on xxxxxx. xxxxxx is a six-meter telescope located in xxxxxx in xxxxxx at an elevation of 5190 m. A polarization sensitive upgrade to xxxxxx, known as xxxxxxPol, is now beginning observations. Throughout the length of the fellowship, we will work to implement and observe with xxxxxxPol. We will be able to study the growth of cosmic structure in our universe via detections of galaxy clusters and gravitational lensing of the CMB and will improve constraints on cosmological parameters that describe the early universe.With the use of approximately 3,000 superconducting detectors operating at 90 GHz and 150 GHz, xxxxxxPol will enable high precision measurements of the polarization of the CMB.  One of my goals during the fellowship is to help develop a future upgrade to xxxxxx that will provide wider frequency coverage with many more detectors. An important aspect of this project will be research into reading out larger superconducting detector arrays, which could impact technologies for future xxxxxx space missions, such as a next generation X-ray observatory or the Inflation xxxxxx.  This as well as research on silicon optics will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at xxxxxx. The optics research is relevant to measurements over a wide range of wavelengths, from far infrared to millimeter wave, and could be used on future xxxxxx missions at these wavelengths. The research conducted under this fellowship will contribute towards improving the technology readiness levels of all the associated technologies for use in future xxxxxx missions.	15634
FIELD EXP EARTH PARABOLA CALIBRATED RDR SPECTRUM V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	PARABOLA data were obtained at three GRSFE modeling sites in xxxxxx. The playa site, the cobble site, and the mantled flow site. Each site was imaged by PARABOLA at a variety of solar incidence angles to characterize the scattering properties of the surface completely. This information can be used as a reference to correct airborne data from ASAS and AVIRIS from any lighting and viewing geometry, or as a base data set to test radiative transfer models. Six sets of data from the playa site were gathered primarily on xxxxxxy 17, 1989 with solar incidence angles that varied from 28 to 71 degrees. Five sets of cobble site data were gathered during the morning of xxxxxxy 18, 1989 with incidence angles from 19 to 57 degrees. xxxxxx from the mantled flow site was obtained six times during the afternoon of xxxxxxy 18 with incidence angles from 21 to 73 degrees.

Mesoporous Silicon-Based Anodes for High Capacity, High Performance Li-ion Batteries, Phase II	2013-06-01	2018-07-19	A new high capacity anode composite based on mesoporous silicon is proposed. By virtue of a structure that resembles a pseudo one-dimensional phase, the active anode material will be able to accommodate significant volume changes expected upon alloying and de-alloying with lithium. The mesoporosity will be created without the aid of a surfactant template using a novel high volume synthetic process. The anode composite based on this material is designed to have a reversible xxxxxx capacity exceeding 600 mAh/g or nearly twice that obtainable with graphite anodes; indeed much higher capacities could be practically attainable. xxxxxx I successfully demonstrated the synthesis of this new meso-Si material as well as its high electrochemical activity and rechargeability. An expanded investigation on the development of mesoporous Si-based xxxxxx anode is the principal objective in xxxxxx. The optimum anode will be evaluated in xxxxxx cells containing 4V oxide cathodes.	15636

ULY JUP SCE DOPPLER HI-RES DATA	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx spacecraft was occulted by the Io xxxxxx Torus (IPT) during its xxxxxx encounter on 8 February 1992. The xxxxxx dual-frequency radio subsystem used by the xxxxxx xxxxxxar xxxxxx Experiment (SCE) was utilized to measure the electron content (column density) of the IPT [BIxxxxxxTAL1992B]. In the nominal mode for radio-sounding observations [BIxxxxxxTAL1992A], both downlinks (S-band: f_s = 2.3 GHz X-band: f_x = 8.4 GHz) are phase coherent with the uplink (S-band: f_u = 2.1 GHz). The dual-frequency radio-sounding technique exploits the dispersive nature of ionized media on the propagation of the two downlinks. The tiny xxxxxx shift due to plasma moving in and out of the ray path is greater at S-band than at the higher frequency X-band.	15639

Lightweight Thermally Stable Multi-Meter Aperture Submillimeter Reflectors, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	Future astrophysics missions will require lightweight, thermally stable, submillimeter reflectors in sizes of 4m and greater.  To date, graphite fiber reinforced composite (GFRC) construction has been used in many cases to ideally meet the reflector needs of submillimeter and microwave instruments, but only in sizes upto 2m.  This project significantly advances the size and accuracy capability of GFRC reflector technology for future missions by focusing on innovation in two limiting areas: precision mandrel fabrication, and core induced surface error.  xxxxxx cost and quality can often be thee most significant budget and schedule challenge to a reflector program.  To reduce cost, recent commercial innovations in optical grinding and polishing will be investigated for applicability to fabrication of a 4m convex tool.  A variety of traditional and non-conventional tool materials will be considered.  No-mandrel assembly concepts will also be investigated.  To improve reflector surface accuracy, improvement is needed to mitigate the anisotropic nature of GFRC core.  Novel methods of attaching core elements to faceskins will be investigated, as well as alternative core materials and manufacturing approaches.  xxxxxx will result in a preliminary point design for a 4m-class submm reflector.  Concepts for improvement in mandrel cost and quality, and reduction of core induced surface error, will be defined.  After verification of these concepts in early xxxxxx 2, a 4m-class prototype reflector will be built and tested that demonstrates all key aspects of a multi-meter full-scale reflector design and build.	15642

Miniaturized, High-Reliability CubeSat Release Mechanism	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	This proposal describes a xxxxxx I effort aimed at using additive manufacturing (AM) and a commercial partnership to build a miniaturized, general purpose CubeSat release mechanism. &nbsp;The objective of xxxxxx I is to demonstrate the feasibility of combining an &ldquo;off the shelf&rdquo;, high-reliability actuator with a GSFC designed mechanism and CubeSat power and volume constraints to achieve a multi-purpose CubeSat release mechanism. The intention of this xxxxxx I effort is to demonstrate the design and proof of concept of a miniaturized release mechanism.&nbsp; As part of that effort, it is our intention to demonstrate the value of using both additive manufacturing (AM) techniques and a commercial partnership to build a miniaturized, general purpose CubeSat release mechanism. &nbsp;The objective of xxxxxx I is to demonstrate the feasibility of combining an &ldquo;off the shelf&rdquo;, high-reliability actuator with a GSFC designed mechanism and CubeSat power and volume constraints to achieve a multi-purpose CubeSat release mechanism.Traditional CubeSat release systems have utilized a burn wire approach for releasing spacecraft systems.&nbsp; There is mounting evidence that these burn wire systems have high failure rates.&nbsp; Additionally, these burn wire systems require refurbishment after every test.&nbsp; This xxxxxxy-Stage xxxxxxovation will demonstrate a high-reliability system that maintains compatibility with CubeSat power and electrical systems.&nbsp; In addition, it is envisioned that a re-settable CoTS actuator can be used that will allow the release mechanism to be reset after every use rather than being replaced.This effort will be broken into 2 phases.&nbsp; The first phase will be the design or a release mechanism that can meet the needs of multiple deployable spacecraft systems.&nbsp; The design will be accomplished using GSFC Computer Aided Design tools.&nbsp; The second phase will then produce a physical, functional model of the proposed design.&nbsp; It is anticipated that the second phase may uncover issues with the design which will then be corrected.&nbsp; The appeal of printing the prototype model is that there can be a quick turn-around between design iterations.	15655
Predictor of Airport Runway Capacity (PARC), Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	Estimates of arrival and departure capacities of individual airport runways are used to predict occurrences of demand-capacity imbalance, and to meter arrivals and departures to balance runway demand with capacity. Inaccurate estimates incorrectly identify demand-capacity, imbalance time periods and metering solutions; resulting in underutilized runways or excessive traffic congestion. xxxxxx predictions enable maximizing airport and flight efficiency. The xxxxxxor of Airport xxxxxx xxxxxxacity (PARC) forecasts the future capacities of individual airport runways under specified operating conditions and a time horizon. PARC uses historical operations data to create and update statistical xxxxxxian network (BN) models of inter-aircraft spacing, accounting for influencing factors. The BN models are used in xxxxxx simulations of airport runway traffic to predict their arrival and departure capacities for the specified operating conditions and scheduled traffic. Traffic managers use PARC's capacity estimates to implement metering programs to efficiently balance runway demand with capacity. For example, forecast weather proximate to Charlotte-xxxxxx International Airport (xxxxxx) will change the prevailing wind direction, ceiling, and xxxxxx (RVR), requiring changing the airport runway configuration from xxxxxx to xxxxxx Flow and the operational flight rules from visual to marginal. Traffic planners want to know if these changes will cause excessive traffic congestion warranting implementation of a departure metering program. PARC determines that the number of scheduled departures will exceed capacity on runway 36C under the forecasted runway configuration, visibility, and traffic conditions. The traffic planners implement metering of runway 36C departures using PARC's runway capacity estimate. Because the estimated runway capacity is accurate, metering neither starves the runways of flights nor creates excessive runway departure queues.	15656

Multi-Scale Modeling of Crack Nucleation and Growth in Additively Manufactured Alloys	2017-08-01	2018-07-19	Additive manufacturing (AM) promises growth in design space, increased speed of production, and decreased cost to aircraft and space technology engineering. For this new process to be fully integrated into xxxxxx fabrication pipeline, a comprehensive understanding of component reliability (and therefore, fatigue life and failure) must be obtained. Thus, the goals of this project are to provide definitive results outlining the strength and reliability of AM materials for xxxxxx, as well as to provide a digital platform and methodology for further tests.The approach to this project involves two parallel xxxxxx will explore the effect of defects characteristic of AM (voids, inclusions, and impurities) on fatigue life in order to better comprehend the governing modes of AM fracture initiation in xxxxxx mission environments. Specifically, I will study short crack nucleation from these defects in aluminum, a popular material in both AM and aerospace applications.-I will undertake this exploration via atomistic-scale simulation, using physics-based models which will be applicable to a wide range of defect sizes and load cases. One large challenge I expect to encounter is the inherent computational intensity of atomistic simulation. Though much progress has been made with respect to efficiently computing these experiments in a tractable clock time, the desire for larger atomistic windows will always persist, and the veracity of my results must always be interpreted with this in mind.The outcomes of this project are designed to help xxxxxx effectively utilize AM technology now and in the future. Instead of long wait times on costly experiments, this software will allow for the characterization of new materials and new AM processes computationally. This will shorten the pipeline between material development and mission implementation, as well as be useful as a design tool for exploring new materials and AM methods. Additionally, these results will be applicable to all.	15665
Towards Accelerated Aging Methodologies and Health Management of Power MOSFETs	2013-06-19	2018-07-19	Understanding aging mechanisms of electronic components is of extreme importance in the aerospace domain where they are part of numerous critical subsystems including avionics. In particular, power MOSFETs are of special interest as they are involved in high voltage switching circuits such as drivers for electrical motors. With increased use of electronics in aircraft control, it becomes more important to understand the degradation of these components in aircraft specific environments.

Within and across these centers, a diverse set of data acquisition systems exist with different hardware and software platforms. The xxxxxx xxxxxx Acquisition xxxxxx (NDAS) is a software suite designed to operate and control many critical aspects of rocket engine testing. The software suite combines real-time data visualization, data recording to a variety formats, short-term and long term acquisition system calibration capabilities, test stand configuration control, and a variety of data post-processing capabilities. Additionally, data stream conversion functions exist to translate test facility data streams to and from downstream systems, including customer systems. The primary design goals for NDAS are flexibility, extensibility, and modularity. Providing a common user interface for a variety of hardware platforms helps drive consistency and error reduction during testing. Also, with an understanding that test facilities have different requirements and setups, the software is designed to be modular. One program may require real-time displays and data recording; others may require more complex data stream conversion, measurement filtering, or test stand configuration management. The NDAS suite allows test facilities to choose which components to use based on their specific needs. The NDAS code is primarily written in xxxxxx, a graphical data-flow driven language. xxxxxxhough xxxxxx&trade; is a general purpose programming language, large-scale software development in the language is relatively rare compared to more commonly used languages. The NDAS software suite also makes extensive use of a new, advanced development framework called the Actor Framework. It provides a level of code reuse and extensibility that has previously been difficult to achieve using xxxxxx. The test complexes at xxxxxx (SSC) require reliable and accurate data acquisition in order to analyze the results of rocket engine tests.&nbsp; Acquisition systems include high-speed data, low-speed data, event monitoring, and video feeds.&nbsp; In order to obtain accurate data, routine calibrations must be performed on each channel, which can be defined as a single data stream to be collected, including the entire hardware chain from signal acquisition by a transducer to signal conditioning by an amplifier and digitization by an xxxxxx-to-Digital converter.Low xxxxxx xxxxxx Acquisition xxxxxx (LSDAS) is utilized to provide real time display and recording of data.&nbsp; This data includes both analog and discrete measurements including but not limited to transducers, transmitters, thermocouples, test stand status monitoring, and valve commands and positions.&nbsp; NDAS must be able to correctly process data from the sensors and convert the data to engineering units.NDAS is a data acquisition system designed for use on all xxxxxx test stands.&nbsp; It replaces the current outdated systems including but not limited to: the xxxxxx xxxxxx Acquisition xxxxxx (SDAS), and the Digital xxxxxx Acquisition xxxxxx (DDAS).&nbsp; Its flexibility and modularity enables it be used with any hardware at any test facility.&nbsp;The NDAS project developed an architecture that would provide:xxxxxxability: xxxxxx abstraction layer adaptable to different acquisition systems with minimal effort,xxxxxxity: Functional areas designed as separate modules to simplify maintenance and life cycle support,Extensibility: Displays and data output files can be customized via a standardized plug-in architecture,Flexibility: xxxxxxovative hierarchical and self-referential database architecture allows for flexibility to deploy to any facility,Unified xxxxxx Configuration: The system, measurements and calibrations are managed and configured within a common user interface, andStreamlined Operations: xxxxxx-time processing and analysis minimizes post-test data processing turnaround time&nbsp;NDAS is written using an object-oriented approach with extensive use of an advanced development framework called the Actor Framework.&nbsp; In this approach, actors serve as the logic units of concurrent computation. In response to a message received, an actor can perform a specific task, send messages, and determine how to respond to messages.&nbsp; The major components of the NDAS software suite are as follows:NIRD - A central database which stores measurement configuration information for running the NDAS software,NOSS - A central system configuration interface for engineers to configure measurements in the NDAS software,NOPS - This function acquires, scales, and propagates all measurement data to client applications,NDIS - A client application for real-time data graphing, tabular displays, and event monitoring,NLOG - A client application for data logging and data file conversion.NGATE - A gateway between NDAS and downstream systems, converting customer data streams to NDAS data streams and vice versa.&nbsp;NCAL - This function performs short-term and long-term system calibrations.	15668

(PSI) proposes to develop new solar cells based on a ferroelectric semiconductor absorber material that can yield a 30% increase in efficiency and a 20% increase in specific power compared with current triple-junction xxxxxx-V cells. These gains will be realized by exploiting a unique charge separation mechanism in ferroelectrics that enables open-circuit voltages many times the band gap, leading to maximum power conversion efficiencies exceeding the conventional xxxxxx limit (33%). PSI and team members will create photovoltaic cells based on xxxxxxabundant xxxxxx stabilized in a ferroelectric state by epitaxial strain engineering. By combining above-gap cell voltages with the high absorption coefficient (45% is anticipated to be achievable. Importantly, these cells will also offer improved radiation resistance due to the reduced carrier diffusion lengths required by the unique ferroelectric charge separation mechanism.

Fast Acting Flow Control Valve, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	High power electric propulsion systems have the potential to revolutionize space propulsion due to their extremely high performance.  This can result in significant propellant savings on space vehicles, allowing the overall mass to shrink for launch on a less expensive vehicle or to allow the space vehicle to carry more payload at the same weight.  Many of the electrical propulsion systems operate in pulse mode, pulsing hundreds or even thousands of times per second.

Development of Fast Response SME TiNi Foam Torque Tubes, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	Shape xxxxxxe Technologies (SCT) has pioneered the use of Self-propagating High Temperature Synthesis (SHS) to manufacture open celled, porous xxxxxx.  Recently, we have been able to demonstrate the shape memory effect  in these foams, which is a unique capability.   Unlike solid, monolithic xxxxxx, the open-celled foam structure allows for very rapid response times when immersed in fluids, such as hot water or hot air. The SHS process makes net shape components, and so the cost of the tube can be dramatically reduced, and can have features introduced into the end of the tube to allow for simple torque transfer into a structure.  Thus, in developing a foam torque tube using SHS, all of the key obstacles to its incorporation into existing aerostructures can be resolved, while preserving the key benefits of a lightweight, solid-state structure.	15675

An Integrated Turbulence Hazard Decision Support Tool for Controllers and Dispatchers, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	Every day, turbulence has an adverse effect on aircraft operations and capacity of the NAS, costing the airline industry at least $100 million annually in operational inefficiencies, unscheduled maintenance, and injuries.  A contributor to these costs is that controllers' and dispatchers' current tactical knowledge of turbulence hazards relies heavily on verbal pilot reports of turbulence, which are often inconsistent, late, and subjective.  AeroTech will develop a turbulence hazard decision support tool (xxxxxx) that will enhance controllers' and dispatchers' situational awareness of the location and severity of turbulence; by providing real-time quantitative turbulence information down-linked from aircraft.  xxxxxx will enhance tactical and strategic decision making with regard to airspace usage and aircraft routing by enabling users to predict the effect of the reported/detected turbulence on aircraft whose route may take them through that location.  With enhanced turbulence knowledge, collaboration with pilots regarding route changes can be improved and cost savings to the airlines can be gained through more efficient and safer aircraft routing.  xxxxxx I will prove technical feasibility of integrating the turbulence information and will develop, using controller and dispatcher inputs, CONOPS and requirements for the xxxxxx.  By xxxxxx, a meaningful controller/dispatcher xxxxxx will be developed, tested, and evaluated.	15682
Silicone Adhesives for High Temperature Inflatable Fabrics and Polymer Films, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	Thin films, elastomeric materials, high temperature fabrics and adhesives that are capable of withstanding thermal extremes (-130oC to 500oC) are highly desirable for use in inflatable decelerator applications.  One solution is to substantially increase the thermal conductivity of the adhesive layer underneath the thin film layer so that heat generated during entry of the decelerator into the atmosphere can be quickly and effectively dissipated, thus avoiding the negative effect of high temperature. We propose an approach wherein a low volume fraction (<5%) of inorganic nanoparticle fillers will lead to substantial increase in thermal conductivity in the direction perpendicular to the thin film. The innovation is in the development and processing of a unique morphology of the nanocomposite adhesive material. In xxxxxx I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept by fabricating elastomeric adhesives containing nanoscale additives, and testing the thermal conductivity perpendicular to the thin film direction. The xxxxxx I program is a collaboration with a leading manufacturer of inflatable structures for space applications. The focus of the xxxxxx program will be in implementing the technology in a prototype component, which will be tested and qualified, and made available to xxxxxx. The proposed work builds upon NEI's prior experience with nanoparticle dispersed material systems.	15683

In 2012, JPL R&TD is funding the development of a novel steel-xxxxxx alloy that is included in this proposal as the weld connection between a steel bench and an xxxxxx optical mount. By tuning the composition of the gradient alloy to the prototype hardware, the thermal expansion between the two can be predicted and controlled. This will eliminate the need for brazing or fastening hardware, reduce the stresses associated with thermal-cyclic fatigue, and improve reliability. The fabrication of such a gradient alloy by traditional metallurgical techniques is not possible. The LENS technique offers the additional ability to fabricate net and near-net shape components from the gradient alloy, limiting the need for machining, by laser depositing the constituent metals at independently controlled rates via the LENS system's computer-controlled multi-nozzle feature. The resulting part is fully dense, has a gradient transition from one alloy to another, and is tough (free of cracks and brittle intermetallic phases). The workshop is a natural evolution advancement from the current project because it will utilize the new material in optical packaging and other applications that are plagued with design challenges.	15684

128x128 Ultra-High Density Optical Interconnect, Phase II	2006-12-01	2018-07-19	Future xxxxxx programs like Tertiary xxxxxxet Finder (xxxxxx) require high-density deformable mirrors with up to 16,000 actuators to enable direct imaging of planets around distant stars. xxxxxx has been developing high-density module actuator arrays that will enable deformable mirrors to be fabricated with array sizes up to 128 by 128. These monolithic actuator arrays have eliminated the need for discrete wires by using internal electrical conductors that terminate at the back of the module. Concepts for electrical attachment have been developed to allow laboratory testing and evaluation, but reliable interconnect technology must be developed that will allow the module mirror technology to meet space qualification requirements. Environmental requirements for the interconnect include radiation, mechanical, thermal and life cycle loads. The interconnect must also survive subsequent assembly processes including thermal and coating vacuum cycles. We are proposing under xxxxxx I to investigate electrical interface options, materials and processes for the module arrays compatible with future space qualification requirements. During a follow on xxxxxx a high density interconnect for a full scale 32 by 32 mirror would be built and assembly processes qualified with rigorous testing.	15686
Fiber-Coupled Spectrometer for TPS Materials, Phase II	2013-05-01	2018-07-19	"EDA, xxxxxx., in partnership with Penn State, has shown previously that the concept of embedding fiber optics within ablative TPS material has merit and should yield a successful implementation of a spectrometer \"window\" during a xxxxxx development program. xxxxxxical instrumentation, such as optical spectrometers would provide benchmark data for fundamental flow, radiation, and materials modeling as well as provide operational correlations between vehicle reentry drag and radiation if implemented in a TPS flight test program.  Without flight spectral data, and the appropriate modeling efforts, the power of prediction to assist in new heat shield design does not exist for reentry into other planetary atmospheres.  This is a severe limitation for future space exploration missions which xxxxxxxxxxxx helps address."	15687

Advanced Composite Thrust Chambers for the Altair Lunar Lander, Phase II	2012-12-01	2018-07-19	Radiation-cooled, bipropellant thrusters are being considered for the Ascent xxxxxx main engine of the xxxxxx.  Currently, iridium-lined rhenium combustion chambers are the state-of-the-art for radiatively cooled thrusters.  To increase the performance of radiation-cooled engines, improved chamber materials are needed that will allow higher operating temperatures, better resistance to oxidation, and reduce mass.  During this effort, an innovative composite thrust chamber is being developed that will incorporate advanced ceramic oxide and iridium liner techniques as well as replacing the expensive, high density rhenium with a low mass carbon-carbon composite.  The xxxxxx I results have demonstrated the potential of combining innovative fabrication techniques to produce an advanced ceramic-Ir lined C-C thrust chamber. Hot gas testing has shown the ability of the ceramic oxide coating to reduce the exterior temperature of the C-C jacket, which will enable the use of higher temperature propellants for improved performance.  No damage was observed in the ceramic-Ir liner as a result of hot gas testing.  During xxxxxx, the techniques will be optimized to allow fabrication of a 3000 lbf chamber that will be delivered to xxxxxx-MSFC for hot-fire testing.	15691
Next Generation X-ray Detectors for a Probe Class Mission this Decade	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	This effort comprises the design, production, and test of a novel focal plane for x-ray astrophysics.  Our group has previously developed a multi-absorber pixel (the xxxxxx) that achieves high spatial and electrical resolution in large focal planes, sacrificing x-ray count rate to readout the large array with fewer total sensors.  For our new design, we create a large field of view imager, from two arrays of hydra designs at two different absorber scales surrounding a central array with high-resolution, high-speed single pixels.  xxxxxx methods of array heatsinking will be explored in this array with the intention of achieving the best specifications of each detector design within a single array.Design of the three array focal plane includes calculation of the various pixel performance specifications to optimize for each sub-array. xxxxxx the demanding specifications of each design is complicated by the fact that certain layers in the fabrication (such as the superconducting device layer that determines operation temperature) are common to the three arrays, limiting the design space. Additionally, the presence of the different device scales presents a challenge to wiring of the array and the need to develop a low crosstalk crossover method for sorting the array into region that can share common bias of its pixels.  The second phase of the work will focus on improving the heatsinking in these arrays.  The heatsinking will be added last so that it can be varied in properties and heatsunk regions can be segregated.  While more open-ended, this research will explore how improvements in practical array performance can be achieved.	15692

Upper-Atmospheric Space and Earth Weather Experiment	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	The USEWX project is seeking to monitor, record, and distribute atmospheric measurements of the radiation environment by installing a variety of dosimeters and other instrumentation on xxxxxx aircraft. The goal is to routinely provide real-time, in-flight radiation measurements to modelers and the space-weather community. Radiation present in the upper atmosphere is harmful to humans and sensitive electronic equipment. Current radiation forecasting techniques employ data from satellites and ground-based detectors to predict radiation levels in flight. Aviation is trending toward flying at higher altitudes and over polar routes, where radiation events are more likely to occur and obtaining radiation data via traditional means is more difficult. Real-time, broad spectral-based radiation measurements are needed to improve radiation forecasts and space weather understanding.Work to date: The USEWX team has cross-calibrated two gold-standard HAWK Tissue Equivalent xxxxxx Counter (TEPC) dosimeters with the xxxxxx Radiation Measurements for Aviation Safety (ARMAS) xxxxxx dosimeter in ground-based particle accelerators. The ARMAS xxxxxx dosimeter was developed under the Small Business xxxxxxovation xxxxxxearch (xxxxxx) program and has been used to collect data on approximately 50 flights of an xxxxxx DC-8 aircraft. Honeywell&rsquo;s Thermalized xxxxxx Measurement (xxxxxx) experiment has passed the xxxxxx Safety xxxxxx Group (SSWG) review, will be tech briefed shortly, and should be flying before the end of the 2014. Construction of the ARMAS xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx 3 and the xxxxxx have been completed, and both have been flown on xxxxxx&#39;s ER-2 High-xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx.&nbsp;Looking ahead: The HAWK TEPC dosimeters will be undergoing tech brief in mid-2015 for integration in the ER-2. The ER-2 will then be ready for supporting the Radiation And Dosimetry eXperiment (RAD-X) where the ER-2 will under fly the xxxxxx xxxxxx high altitude balloon out of xxxxxx, NM in xxxxxxember 2015.&nbsp; This work will capture a wide range of altitudes detecting radiation and categorizing a significant slice of the atmospheric radiation environment, something never done before.The team will also be using the ARMAS-xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx 5 as a self-contained, miniaturized, multiple power and data distribution (NASDAT and Iridium) unit capable of multiple platform dosimeter use.

Biomedical Monitoring by a Novel Noncontact Radio Frequency Technology	2014-07-01	2018-07-19	The area of xxxxxx Health and Medicine is one of the xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx. xxxxxx is an extreme environment which is not conducive to human life. The extraterrestrial environment can result in the deconditioning of various human physiological systems and thus require easy to use physiological monitoring technologies in order to better monitor space crews for appropriate health management and successful space missions and space operations.  Furthermore, xxxxxx calls for improvements in research to support human health and performance (xxxxxx 06). To address these needs, this project investigated a potential noncontact and noninvasive radio frequency-based technique of monitoring central hemodynamic function in human research subjects in response to orthostatic stress.     This technology will be a quantum advance in cardiac monitoring and will be applicable in numerous situations such as for immediate assessment and monitoring of patients in life-threatening emergencies, during environmental stressors, and in performance of hazardous occupational tasks. Because the RFII data can be monitored from a central location, multiple devices could be used to monitor several patients simultaneously, such as in a car accident with multiple injured victims. For xxxxxx these benefits will apply to both flight and ground personnel. For the military this device can be used during actual combat to alert medical personnel when a service member is wounded and to monitor his/her condition even before help is provided thus lowering medical evaluation times. This can also be used to aid medical personnel allowing them to prioritize triage and evacuation in multiple casualty contingencies.  The goal for this project is to design, develop and advance technology for a near-instantaneous, non-invasive radio frequency-based method for measuring heart and lung function without invasive probes, cuffs, electrodes and without patient contact.	15699
Molecular mechanism of flocculation self-recognition in yeast and its role in mating and survival	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	xxxxxx cerevisiae flocculation occurs when fermentable sugars are limiting and is therefore considered as a way to enhance the survival chance of Flo-expressing yeast cells. In this paper the role of Flo1p in mating was demonstrated by showing that the mating efficiency which contributes to the increased survival rate as well by generating genetic variability is increased when cells flocculate. This was revealed by liquid growth experiments in a low shear environment and differential transcriptome analysis of FLO1 expressing cells compared to the non-flocculent wild-type cells. The results show that a floc provides a uniquely organized multicellular ultrastructure that provides a suitable microenvironment to induce and perform cell conjugation. S. cerevisiae strains BY4742 WT BY4742::FLO8 and BY4742 [FLO1] were grown in microgravity and 1-g. A transcriptomic analysis was performed and the transcriptome data were integrated with the high quality protein-protein interaction networks. The identified high score sub-networks (qvalue < 0.001) were considered and further evaluated concerning their GO enrichment using a hypogeometric test.	15700

Development of an Earth Smallsat Flight Test to Demonstrate Viability of Mars Aerocapture	2020-08-01	2018-07-19	Aerocapture is an orbit insertion technique that offers significant reductions in mass and cost for a large number of space missions. Despite its benefits, one of the main reasons that aerocapture has not been used on a flight mission is that it has not yet been flight tested. The research proposed here will address this problem by designing an xxxxxxbased aerocapture flight test utilizing a smallsat.Conceptual design of the flight test will focus on producing a fully-documented mission concept to demonstrate aerocapture. One of the primary conceptual challenges involves developing an aerocapture flight system for use on a smallsat. xxxxxx such as drag modulation-based energy control will be considered to reduce the system complexity. xxxxxx selection will be accomplished through means of a comprehensive trade study; focus will be placed on control and thermal requirements, simplicity, and the applicability of the system to other missions. The chosen system will drive other facets of mission design, such as the guidance method utilized by the smallsat and selection of the mission trajectory.The second phase of this research will focus on physically developing and testing the aerocapture system and spacecraft in preparation for the smallsat test flight. A secondary payload mission architecture will be utilized for the flight test to minimize cost. The design process of the spacecraft will offer a number of opportunities for student leadership and multidisciplinary collaboration. A successful demonstration will show that aerocapture can be used as an effective means of orbit insertion at xxxxxx and other atmospheric worlds, with scalable applications to both large and small spacecraft and missions.	15702

PM/IDE will enable novice modelers to review and understand models more expediently, so they can learn modeling techniques more efficiently.  PM/IDE also will enable experienced modelers to review the models of others more quickly, so they can share modeling techniques and best practices.  xxxxxx graphical displays will enable modelers to describe planning domain models under construction and the plans they can generate to domain experts in order to facilitate more efficient knowledge elicitation and model review.  Without PM/IDE, xxxxxx modeling will remain a tedious and difficult task that can be carried out only by the small number of people who have the necessary specialized skills and patience. This, in turn, will severely limit the use of xxxxxx-based automated planning systems.During xxxxxx I, we characterized the planning domain modeling task to identify the types of analyses and decisions that modelers carry out and the kinds of information they review and assess.  xxxxxx on this understanding of the task, we designed and prototyped PM/IDE capabilities and user-system interactions that help people develop xxxxxx models.  During xxxxxx 2, we propose to develop a xxxxxx 7 version of PM/IDE. Our design approach draws upon our experience using a top-down, decision-centered software requirements and design process to develop data visualization and decision support systems.	15716
Directional Wide-Angle Range Finder (DWARF)	2012-09-01	2018-07-19	The proposed innovation, the Directional Wide-xxxxxxle xxxxxx Finder (DWARF) is the creation of a laser range-finder with a wide field-of-view (FOV) and a directional measurement component. The technical objective is to create a laser rangefinder with an FOV of approximately 6 degrees and a maximum range of 5 km. The technical objective will be tested by checking the sensor&rsquo;s accuracy and maximum and minimum range measurement capabilities. The Directional Wide-xxxxxxle xxxxxx Finder (DWARF) is a laser range-finder with a wide field-of-view (FOV) and a directional measurement component. The overall technical objective is to create a laser rangefinder that has an FOV of approximately 6 degrees, a range measurement capability of up to 5 km, and the ability to measure the bearing to the target to within a couple of degrees. The resulting sensor will be tested to determine its range and bearing accuracy as well as maximum and minimum range measurement capabilities. The sensor, if development continues to a flight system, would end up being a maximum of 8 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 4 inches tall (20 x 10 x 10 cm maximum). This approach to directional laser rangefinding is new, but the technical hurdles are small. Each different piece of this work is based on well-known and working technologies. The DWARF approach is innovative because it combines the simplicity of a time-of-flight laser rangefinder with the bearing measurement capability of a quadrant detector and a long-range capability that exceeds most active sensors now available. This effort will result in at least one new technology report. Time-of-flight measurement works by starting a timer when the outgoing pulse is generated and then stopping the timer when the return pulse is detected. Because the speed of light is constant, the measured time directly corresponds to the range to the target. The range resolution depends on the accuracy of the timer &ndash; a one nanosecond clock interval corresponds to 15 cm of range resolution. xxxxxx = measured-time * speed-of-light/2 The quadrant detector measures the amount of light that hits each quadrant (fourth) of the whole detector. By computing the ratios of the different halves of the quadrant measurements (left / right and top / bottom), the actual bearing to the target can be determined.	15717
Picometer-Resolution MEMS Segmented DM, Phase I	2011-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology has the potential to create deformable mirrors (DM) with 10^4 actuators that have size, weight, and power specifications that are far lower than conventional piezoelectric and electrostrictive DMs. xxxxxxver, building a MEMS DM with a relatively large aperture that is flat in the unpowered state is challenging. Currently, a large portion of the mirror stroke must be used to flatten the MEMS DMs and in some cases, the DM stroke is not even sufficient to flatten the mirror. In the case of the large-stroke segmented MEMS DMs manufactured by xxxxxx AO, there is sufficient stroke for wavefront correction after flattening. xxxxxxver, the resolution is significantly reduced because the dynamic range of the digital-to-analog converters (DAC) used to operate the DM is spread over multiple microns of stroke rather than the 0.5 µm range required to correct for aberrations in the telescope that feeds the coronagraph.This xxxxxx I xxxxxx will make substantial improvements in the fabrication process of MEMS segmented DMs that reduce the deleterious residual surface-figure errors. It will do so by systematically addressing the sources of the segment position variations as well as addressing low-spatial frequency chip bow that can result in large peak-to-valley deformations across the DM array. The xxxxxx AO DM architecture will also be modified to enable picometer resolution actuation with ultra-precision drive electronics.	15718
Mars Electric Reusable Flyer	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	One of the main issues with a xxxxxx flight vehicle concept that can be reused and cover long distances for maximum surface data gathering is its ability to take off, hover, transition to forward flight and then land safely and precisely. While other xxxxxx flight vehicle concepts have proposed gliding flight with crash landings or low efficiency hovering flight with very little ground coverage, the proposed concept will combine hovering and fast forward flight capability into a single efficient aircraft that can be recharged and reused many times. The extremely low surface pressure on xxxxxx requires new low-xxxxxx number, low-density aerodynamics combined with a light-weight structure with extremely low disc loading and low wing loading. The main objectives in FY2017 are: 1) Perform a high altitude balloon drop model test from approximately 100,000 feet to gather key aerodynamic and controls data such as lift coefficient, drag coefficient, and stability characteristics in a relevant environment. An xxxxxx xxxxxx Opportunity Program award has been granted to the project to perform the high altitude balloon drop in the Spring of 2017.2) xxxxxx the investigation of new fabrication techniques that will enable very low weight airframe and propeller designs. These designs may include laser cut carbon fiber frames and durable surface coverings that can withstand low temperatures and dust abrasion over long periods of time. Full-size airframes will be constructed and flown in a 60 foot diameter low pressure chamber at xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx. 3) Continue flight research on vision-based autonomous navigation (visual odometry / IMU fusion) with a focus on hovering navigation in a 3-D environment simulating extreme terrain such as lava tubes and canyons.	15719
High Sensitivity, High Frequency Sensors for Hypervelocity Testing and Analysis, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx xxxxxx I xxxxxx program would develop high sensitivity, high frequency nanomembrane (NM) based surface sensors for hypervelocity testing and analysis on wind tunnel models as well as operational aerospace vehicles, using SOI NM techniques in combination with our pioneering HybridSil ceramic nanocomposite materials. Such low-modulus, conformal nanomembrane sensor skins with integrated interconnect elements and electronic devices can be applied to new or existing propulsion systems for high frequency surface pressure analysis. During this program, large continuous NMs of single crystal Si, SiGe and Ge will be readily released from the engineered wafers using wet chemical etching and transferred to flexible substrates to form multi-axis surface pressure sensors and arrays. xxxxxxs may be connected to external support instrumentation either through thin film and ribbon cable interconnects, or potentially wirelessly using RF communication directly from electronic networks incorporated into the sensor skin material.	15720

Enhanced Damage Tolerance High Temperature Composite Using a Biomimetic Toughening System, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxweight composite structures are required to provide space vehicles with increased thrust-to-weight ratio and durability.  xxxxxx methods for toughening composites that also add functionality, such as making high temperature structural composites more thermally and electrically conductive, can increase spacecraft performance.  xxxxxx proposes to enhance toughness of a thermal-oxidatively stable structural composite by more than 50 percent (measured by G1C) by depositing dispersed carbon nanofibers within insulating, resin-rich, interlaminar regions. Our approach also increases z-direction thermal and electrical conductivity, enabling dissipation of heat and electrical charge from hot spacecraft power supply and propulsion enclosures.  In xxxxxx I, we will process commercial carbon nanofibers and high temperature composite prepreg into nanofiber-toughened and control composite test panels using an autoclave.  Cured composite test panels will be tested for G1C, open hole tensile and short beam shear strength, thermal and electrical conductivity and failure analysis to demonstrate feasibility.  In xxxxxx, we will refine the composite toughening process and materials, conduct compression-after-impact tests, scale-up and produce a prototype multifunctional composite spacecraft structure for testing.  Our team includes commercial prepreg and carbon nanofiber suppliers, a space vehicle structure manufacturer and experts in high temperature composite processing.	15722

We need to be able to simulate the low xxxxxx orbital environment here so that we select sensor materials that we know will survive a xxxxxx mission prior to launch. It is known that xxxxxx upper atmosphere contains atomic oxygen, but the xxxxxx upper atmosphere is much harsher than was originally thought. xxxxxx probe sensor surfaces tested under xxxxxx (LEO) atomic oxygen conditions for the xxxxxx (xxxxxx and xxxxxx EvolutioN) mission, which performed under LEO environment conditions, experienced unexpected loss in performance in low xxxxxx orbit.  The goal is to understand the cause of degradation of xxxxxx probe and other sensor materials observed on the xxxxxx spacecraft and develop a capability to simulate the degradation on the ground to enable development of xxxxxx environment durable sensors.	15723
Microarray Profile of Gene Expression during Osteoclast Differentiation in Modeled Microgravity	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	xxxxxx leads to a 10-15% loss of bone mass in astronauts during space flight. Osteoclast is the multinucleated bone resorbing cell. In this study we used xxxxxx developed ground based xxxxxx (RWV) Rotary Cell Culture xxxxxx (xxxxxxS) to simulate microgravity (uXg) conditions and demonstrated a significant increase (2-fold) in osteoclastogenesis compared to ground based control (Xg) mouse bone marrow cultures. We further determined the gene expression profiling of RAW 264.7 osteoclast progenitor cells in microgravity by agilent microarray analysis. xxxxxx expression pattern was functional group clustered by transcriptome analysis using gene ontology tree machine (GOTM) for cell proliferation/survival differentiation and function. We confirm the microgravity modulated gene expression critical for osteoclast differentiation by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in murine bone marrow cultures. We identify transcription factors such as c-xxxxxx c-Fos PU-1 critical for osteoclast differentiation is up-regulated in microgravity conditions. In addition microgravity resulted in 2.3 and 2.0-fold increase in the level of cathepsin K and MMP-9 matrix metalloproteinase expression in preosteoclast cells involved in the bone resorption process respectively. We also demonstrate a significant increase in the expression levels of M-CSF receptor c-Fms and PLCy2 and xxxxxx molecules that play an important role in Ca2+ signaling essential for osteoclast function. Further microgravity stimulated preosteoclast cells showed elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels compared to ground based control cells. Thus microgravity regulated gene expression profiling in preosteoclast cells provide new insights in to molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of osteoclast differentiation/activation responsible for bone loss and fracture risk in astronauts during space flight mission. xxxxxx associated with space flight is a challenge for normal bone homeostasis. xxxxxxs experience 10-15% bone loss during a space flight mission. We aimed to determine the effect of simulated microgravity on osteoclast preosteoclasts cells. xxxxxx cells (1.5 x 106 /ml) were loaded in xxxxxxS with DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were stimulated with RANKL (80ng/ml) for 24 h to obtain preosteoclasts in parallel with ground based control cells. Total xxxxxx was isolated using xxxxxxzol reagent (xxxxxx xxxxxx TX) from control (Xg) and microgravity (uXg) subjected cells and hybridized with Agilent whole mouse genome 4x44K array system. Slides were washed and scanned on an Agilent G2565 microarray scanner. xxxxxx obtained were analyzed with Agilent feature extraction and xxxxxxSpring GX v7.3.1 software packages (Genus biosystem xxxxxx. xxxxxxbrook IL xxxxxx).	15724
High Fidelity Tool for Turbulent Combustion in Liquid Launch Propulsion Systems Based on Spray-Flamelet Methodology, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The innovation proposed here is a high-performance, high-fidelity simulation capability for simulating liquid rocket spray combustion based on a novel spray-flamelet methodology which will be integrated into xxxxxx which is a CFD solver developed by the proposing personnel under funding from xxxxxx over the last several years. A new spray-flamelet formulation will be incorporated into xxxxxx. The particular advantages of this formulation are (i) its consistency with the single-phase flamelet-formulation (already available in xxxxxx), (ii) its formulation in mixture-fraction space, overcoming the non-uniqueness of the classical mixture-fraction parameterization, and (iii) its applicability to finite xxxxxx-number, thereby accounting for particle evaporation, slip-velocity, and poly-dispersed spray-phase. The flamelet methodology already available in xxxxxx &#150; in conjunction with xxxxxx (HRLES) methodology &#150; has facilitated an order of magnitude improvement in simulation turnaround times for xxxxxx applications involving complex physics in 3D geometries. This project is aimed at extending this flamelet methodology to spray combustion resulting in a state-of-the-art design and analysis tool to enable accurate, fast and robust simulations of multiphase combustion in liquid rocket engines (involving liquid propellants such as LOX and xxxxxx/xxxxxx/RP-1/RP-2), combustion stability analysis, etc. which constitute critical components of xxxxxx upper stage launch propulsion systems	15725
Automated Semantic Enrichment for Data Discovery and Decision Support, Phase II	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate a set of methods for automatically extracting metadata from diverse data sets to serve as a common vocabulary by which data can easily be queried, retrieved and combined for visualization in a geobrowser. We propose extracting keyword tags from both structured and unstructured data sets by applying natural language processing (NLP) to metadata and unstructured content. The extracted tags will be associated with each data set as supplementary metadata to assist with data discovery, categorization and spatial-temporal location. We combine manually-generated tags, based on domains of interest or specific decision support activities, with automatically generated tags from NLP, and to develop hierarchical clusters of the combined tags to serve as a common set of descriptors by which different data sets can be discovered and combined. If proven successful, our approach will be useful for the management and fusion of very large and diverse data sets not only for applied science and decision support, but also for emergency management and related security operations, for business intelligence, and for other application involving large quantities of diverse data, both structured and unstructured.	15726
Magnesium MMC for Aerospace Structures, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx will return to the IIS by 2014 and the moon by 2020.  To accomplish these missions, xxxxxx will exploit to the maximum degree possible the xxxxxx architecture and especially the lessons learned and technological advances that have occurred over the intervening 40 years in building robust, cost effective, efficient, and, partly reusable launch, lander, explorer, and resupply vehicles.  In support of this effort, xxxxxx Assessment & Transfer (TA&T) proposes to develop a magnesium metal matrix composite (MMC) for use as aerospace structural members.  This material exhibits three times the specific stiffness of the best aluminum-lithium alloys and two times that of xxxxxxs.  TA&T will demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of a low temperature method for achieving high loading of ceramic particles in a magnesium matrix that will enable a cast or extruded structural material of non-uniform cross-section exhibiting the unusual combination of light weight, high specific stiffness and strength, radiation shielding, and low cost.  The MMC will be protected from corrosion by a unique thin film coating designed specifically to prevent corrosion of aluminum and magnesium alloys.	15727

A Silicon Carbide Foundry for NASA's UV and High Temperature CMOS Electronics Needs, Phase II	2019-05-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxxnics has developed a patent-pending technology to design and fabricate xxxxxx Carbide (xxxxxx)  MOSFET opto-electronic integrated circuits (ICs). We both fully design and fabricate these xxxxxx xxxxxxo-xxxxxxnic ICs in the xxxxxx using our own design methodologies, xxxxxx process recipes and in-house fabrication facility. We will design, fabricate and test xxxxxx Extreme, xxxxxx and xxxxxxp xxxxxx photodetectors. We will prototype PN xxxxxxction and xxxxxx barrier linear photodiodes, as well as low dark count avalanche photodiodes. We will design and fabricate a two-dimensional 256 by 256 passive UV xxxxxx focal plane array. Array elements will be fabricated in-house, out of both PN junction and xxxxxx barrier detectors, using xxxxxx's process and facilities. We will design and fabricate opto-electronic integrated circuits, where we will integrate various types of detectors with a MOS operational amplifier into a single IC to actively convert the photo current to usable voltage levels. We will also design and fabricate an integrated photodetector and 3-xxxxxx pixel for active readout. xxxxxx active pixel readout 3-T circuits will be an array to form a xxxxxx active pixel MOS xxxxxxp UV imager.  Our in-house fabrication process will also be upgraded. We will automate optical alignment to improve our microfabrication resolution and reduce minimum feature size. We will perform gate oxide anneals to improve carrier mobility. Improving mobility and reducing the minimum feature size will increase MOSFET performance and increase speed of opto-integrated circuits. Furthermore, xxxxxx allows for optoelectronic operation at high temperatures. We will test our circuits up to 500C and utilize special metal contact stacks to enhance high temperature reliability. Finally, we will make our in-house process available to xxxxxx and provide a process development kit for use of our fabrication facility to prototype new application specific xxxxxx integrated circuits.	15729
Conceptual Design and Concept of Operations for Intermittent Short-Radius Centrifugation for Artificial Gravity	2021-09-01	2018-07-19	The objective of this investigation is to fill a significant void in current countermeasures for spaceflight-induced human physiological deconditioning by creating and assessing the feasibility of a conceptual design and architecture for intermittent artificial gravity (AG). Future plans for long-duration spaceflight missions to the moon, asteroids, and xxxxxx have created excitement across many disciplines regarding the possibility of humans once again traveling beyond low Earth orbit. Vehicle designs are underway for xxxxxx exploration; however, previous research suggests that the duration of reduced gravity exposure for a xxxxxx mission will lead to substantial physiological deconditioning in astronauts. This will not only impact the health of the crew, but an impaired crew could catastrophically impact mission success and safety. There are numerous countermeasures currently in use or proposed, but each one provides the means of combating deleterious effects of spaceflight of individual systems; thus a suite of countermeasures are required to keep the crew alive, healthy, and functional. Even then, for future 1000+ day missions and associated exposure to reduced gravity, these countermeasures may not be enough to correct the impeded ability of the astronauts to function effectively upon gravity transitions. AG is an integrated, comprehensive countermeasure that has the potential to mitigate deconditioning in multiple systems concurrently, and thus could be a game-changing technology for extended duration flight. xxxxxxver, today there exists a lack of baseline mission architecture for AG (i.e., low technology readiness level or xxxxxx), and this uncertainty and absence of design has prevented its use as a countermeasure in flight. The goal of the current proposed research is to increase the xxxxxx for AG and fill this gap by providing both a conceptual design and concept of operations for AG technology. Using a sequential approach, this research will include a systematic series of investigations and design iterations to recommend optimized parameters (i.e., angular velocity, gravitational loading, radius) for a short-radius intermittent centrifuge with an accompanying exposure prescription (i.e., for how per day long astronauts should be exposed to centrifugation).  This investigation will conclude with a systems engineering analysis to estimate mass, power, volume, and cost of the optimized system to prove feasibility and provide a long-term solution for physiological deconditioning during extended-duration spaceflight.	15730

An Integrated Human System Interaction (HSI) Framework for Human-Agent Team Collaboration, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx commitment to a human presence in space exploration results in the interaction of humans with challenging environments in space, on lunar, and on planetary bodies.   xxxxxx these challenges requires the development of technologies that will support human system interaction by integrating monitoring, feedback and situational awareness across all types of mission parameters and observables. A successful human system interaction (HSI) system could extend based on existing agent frameworks and software architectures in which xxxxxx is interested. Our proposed approach enables the design of embedded protocols for human-agent interactions to support crew health, safety, and cognitive load modeling in the context of supporting plan execution as well as overall mission goals and activities. Particularly, our proposed HSI framework consists of various types of agents (including sensing and situational awareness abilities, etc.), a suite of HSI protocols for delegation, adjustable autonomy, situational awareness, HSI and mission-oriented coordination, and the integration of the proposed framework with existing systems to assist mission task operations by providing previously hard to observe, yet vital dynamic information, e.g. human health conditions. Our innovation is an agent-based integrated framework for modeling, simulation and implementation of context and mission aware human-system interaction protocols and interfaces.	15732

3-color DPAS Aerosol Absorption Monitor, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop a highly sensitive and compact device to monitor light absorption from atmospheric aerosols simultaneously at three spectral regions, red, green, and blue. The proposed method is primarily based on the differential photoacoustic (xxxxxx) technique and will also take advantage of the current rapid development on high-power semiconductor lasers. The proposed RGB xxxxxx xxxxxx Absorption Monitor will eventually be less than 25 pounds in weight and consume approximately 300W electrical power. It will also be capable of being remotely controlled and being operated at a variety of sampling pressure conditions for the airborne measurements. Since all the major components of the proposed system are commercially available except the home-designed acoustic cells, its total manufacturing cost could be less than $20,000 per unit.	15735
Designing Resource-Bounded Reasoners using Bayesian Networks	2010-09-10	2018-07-19	"In this work we are concerned with the conceptual design of large-scale diagnostic and health management systems that use xxxxxxian networks. While they are potentially powerful, improperly designed xxxxxxian networks can result in too high memory requirements or too long inference times, to they point where they may not be acceptable for real-time diagnosis and health management in resource-bounded systems such as xxxxxx aerospace vehicles. We investigate the clique tree clustering approach to xxxxxxian network inference, where increasing the size and connectivity of a xxxxxxian network typically also increases clique tree size. This paper combines techniques for analytically characterizing clique tree growth with bounds on clique tree size imposed by resource constraints, thereby aiding the design and optimization of large-scale xxxxxxian networks in resource-bounded systems.

High Recovery, Low Fouling Reverse Osmosis Membrane Elements for Space Wastewater Reclamation, Phase II	2010-01-01	2018-07-19	With the expected extension of duration of the space missions outlined in xxxxxx Vision of xxxxxx Exploration, such as a manned mission to xxxxxx or the establishment of a lunar base, the need to produce potable water from onboard wastewater streams in a closed-loop system becomes critical for life support and health of crew membranes. Reverse osmosis (RO) is a compact process that has proven its ability to remove inorganic and organic contaminants from space mission wastewater. Our xxxxxx I feasibility study indicate that the use of low-energy composite hollow fiber RO membranes developed at Santa Fe xxxxxx and xxxxxx resulted in a 65-80% increase in the production of purified water compared to that obtained from the corresponding low-energy RO flat-sheet membrane without sacrificing the water quality of the permeate stream. Therefore, replacing existing spiral wound membrane elements in the RO subsystem with hollow fiber membrane elements will reduce the batch processing time or enable a lower feed pressure to be employed due to the use of higher productivity membrane elements. This will lower the overall power requirement for the RO subsystem. xxxxxx 2 will be based on expanding the size of the membrane element in order to develop several working prototype membrane elements that can eventually be mounted in the RO subsystem of the closed-loop xxxxxxted Water Purification xxxxxx. Also during xxxxxx 2, we will explore the use of hydrophilic polymeric coatings to determine whether it is possible to minimize the rate of membrane fouling due to the high concentration of organics in the wastewater feed stream.	15737

In-Situ Monitoring of Immune Function, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx the health and wellness of mission pilots is a critically important function.  xxxxxx flight has an adverse effect on the human immune response.  During space flight the immune system weakens and some herpes viruses that are typically latent begin to appear in the saliva.  Currently, saliva samples are taken in space and preserved for post flight assay.  The presence of reactivated herpes virus in saliva samples is an indication of a weakening immune defense.  RST xxxxxxscience LLC proposes an innovative in flight assay to monitor the efficacy of the immune system in-situ.    RST xxxxxxscience has designed a test that is perfectly suited for space flight.  The test will be small, light weight and easy to use.  The sample used in this test will be saliva, which can be easily collected through non-invasive means.  xxxxxxults are delivered in minutes to hours.  The test is sterile and disposable, used sample is contained and disposed of along with the disposable kit.  There is no heavy equipment needed to process samples or read results.  The kit is self-contained.  xxxxxx will focus on assay development.  In phase 2 we will build and test a prototype of the disposable delivery device.	15739

Reduction of Flight Control System/Structural Mode Interaction, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	A novel approach is proposed for reducing the degree of interaction of a high gain flight control system with the airframe structural vibration modes, representing a complete departure from the traditional approach of using notch filters.  In principle it offers similar or better performance than notch filters, while not suffering from the attendant low frequency phase lag that has an adverse effect on pilot handling qualities.  Structural mode interaction can be a significant problem in high performance aircraft and other aircraft with low frequency vibration modes.  Use of notch filters requires a compromise to be reached between airframe structural stability and handling qualities.  Successful application of the proposed method will relieve the flight control system designer of the need for managing this compromise and will allow the achievement of full potential system performance with better handling qualities.  xxxxxx feasibility has already been established and xxxxxx I will broadened this to cover practical implementation issues and to define test evaluation plans.  xxxxxx will extend the method into actual test evaluation, either by laboratory test or flight test, or both.  Other possible applications such as aircraft active control systems and control of space structures will be considered during the research program.	15741
Topography improvements in MEMS DMs for high-contrast, high-resolution imaging, Phase II	2015-03-01	2018-07-19	"We propose to develop a 3064 actuator, continuous facesheet MEMS deformable mirror using a modified fabrication process that will eliminate mid-spatial frequency surface figure errors resulting from actuator \"print-through\" topography and stress-induced mirror scallop topography. These figure errors, which occur at spatial frequencies outside the DM control band, are the most significant technological development hurdle preventing the use of MEMS DMs in proximity glare suppression for astronomical coronagraphy. Such wavefront control devices fill a critical technology gap in xxxxxx vision for high-contrast, high-resolution space based imaging and spectroscopy instruments. xxxxxx-based telescopes have become indispensible in advancing the frontiers of astrophysics. Over the past decade xxxxxx has pioneered coronagraphic instrument concepts and test beds to provide a foundation for exploring feasibility of new approaches to high-contrast imaging. From this work, xxxxxx has identified a current technology need for compact, ultra-precise, multi-thousand actuator DM devices. xxxxxx xxxxxxchines Corporation has developed MEMS DMs that represents the state-of-the-art for scalable, small-stroke high-precision wavefront control. The emerging class of high-resolution DMs pioneered by the project team has already been shown to be compact, low-power, precise, and repeatable. These DMs can be currently produced with uncorrectable shape errors as small as 10nm root mean square (rms). The residual shape errors on the DM are mostly periodic and act essentially as a grating, producing diffraction spikes in the image plane. In the xxxxxx I effort, DM fabrication process modifications were developed which will enable the manufacture of these enabling components with an unprecedented surface figure of less than 2nm rms by eliminating surface features resulting from print-through , etch access holes, and mirror attachment posts, and compensating for residual stress induced scalloping."	15742
Integrated CubeSat ADACS with Reaction Wheels and Star Tracker, Phase II	2017-06-01	2018-07-19	"The xxxxxxSS xxxxxx Sextant is a precision attitude determination and control system for xxxxxx and xxxxxxs.  The xxxxxxSS enables future CubeSat missions with precision fine pointing (0.1deg) and dynamic slewing as will be required for imaging operations of ground targets.  A flight control computer, 2 Star xxxxxxs, 3 reaction wheels and 3 electromagnets are incorporated in a 4\" x 4\" x 3\" (3/4U) CubeSat sized module.   The system is based on the highly successful xxxxxx minixxxxxx and extends its performance capability to the 0.1deg range by incorporation of 2 star cameras and attitude determination software.  xxxxxx I developed the software algorithms and prototyped the star cameras and electronics.  xxxxxx consists of a development program culminating with a system at xxxxxx 7.  The technology is significant because it extends the capability of current low cost xxxxxxs to tactical imaging and other missions requiring fine pointing and dynamic retargeting, missions hitherto restricted to large and expensive spacecraft.  The xxxxxxSS will facilitate rapid development of low cost satellites by providing a turnkey system which would be capable of determining and controlling spacecraft attitude automatically; simplifying operations and enabling rapid mission development as envisioned by ORS."	15743
Development of a User Interface for the PVT SelfTest (PST)	2008-08-01	2018-07-19	The overarching goal of the project is to provide a brief, validated, zero upmass, performance test to provide astronauts with immediate feedback about cognitive deficits caused by a variety of factors in space flight (e.g., sleep loss, sleep shifts, medication use). xxxxxxstantial progress has been made on developing astronaut norms based on xxxxxx41 PVT SelfTest trials acquired on 11 astronauts (aquanauts) and other crew acquired in NEEMO 9, NEEMO 12, and NEEMO 13. Significant advances were made in the development of an algorithm that calculates a numerical performance index to provide astronauts with feedback about their PVT SelfTest performance that is both informative about the test performance and about the validity of the test. Prototype data interpretation displays were generated that varied both the type of performance information displayed and the method of display (e.g., numerical, graphical). The performance feedback algorithm and display were programmed into the current xxxxxx PVT SelfTest architecture by Pulsar Informatics xxxxxx. A demonstration version of full PVT SelfTest including performance feedback algorithm and display was generated for evaluation by NEEMO astronauts for refinement and preparation for validation on xxxxxx.	15744

Low Loss Tapered Fiber Waveguide Modulator for Crew Cognitive State Monitoring (CSM)	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	Many crew-related errors in aviation and astronautics are caused by hazardous cognitive states including overstress, disengagement, high fatigue and ineffective crew coordination. Safety can be improved by monitoring and predicting these cognitive states in a non-intrusive manner and designing mitigation strategies. Measuring hemoglobin concentration changes in the brain with functional xxxxxx xxxxxxscopy (fNIRS) is a promising technique for monitoring cognitive state and optimizing human performance during both space and aviation operations. A compact, wearable fNIRS system would provide an innovative early warning system during long duration missions to detect and prevent vigilance decrements in pilots and astronauts.  During FY17 a fNIRS device was designed and built at GRC for human flight simulator testing by xxxxxx beginning Nov 2018. This device uses a bulk modulator because of its higher efficiency and optical output. As a parallel effort, a waveguide modulator was also built which implemented the fNIRS modulation techniques in polarization-maintaining (PM) fiber-pigtailed waveguide form, which is necessary for the device to be miniaturized into a robust system for clinical and field use. But the 90% optical loss of commercial waveguide modulators reduces the optical output of the system below detection limits. The goal of this effort is to decrease the loss of the waveguide modulators from 90% to <10% by tapering PM optical fibers to better couple with the waveguide internal to the modulator, overcoming the intrinsic limiting factor on power throughput to obtain virtually lossless waveguide modulation. The compelling and motivating vision for modifying a xxxxxx-Zehnder interferometric waveguide modulator in this manner is that it enables field-configurable fNIRS instrumentation without the need for the tedious and time-consuming optical alignment required by a bulk modulator. Investing in this effort will enable a working system prototype suitable for field use. This work will leverage prior Center xxxxxxovation Fund (CIF) fNIRS waveguide modulator research as well as the Vytran™ xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxtation obtained from the 2017 xxxxxx Investment Fund (LIF). Final testing will be performed using a novel active phantom developed during our previous CIF award which simulates the optical properties of brain tissue combined with a circulating blood simulant. The goal is to enable a miniaturized, robust and easily configurable fNIRS unit required for field use by reducing waveguide modulator optical loss from current state of the art (SOA) 90% to less than 10%, reducing laser power and PMT requirements.	15750
Fortran Testing and Refactoring Infrastructure, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Tech-X proposes to develop a comprehensive xxxxxx testing and refactoring infrastructure that allows developers and scientists toleverage the benefits of a comprehensive xxxxxxted xxxxxxerEnvironment (IDE).  An intriguing aspect of the infrastructure is the integration of performance measurement and monitoring from withinthe IDE that allows developers to get immediate feedback about tests, the overall application and modifications due to refactoring.  Our goal isto promote modern software engineering methodology to a broad spectrum ofxxxxxx users.The infrastructure will facilitate refactoring newly developed and legacy codes correctly and accurately for single and multi-processor applications and will provide facility for both unit and regression testing. Major benefits to refactoring include creating robust codes that are more easily ported to different hardware and software platforms and promoting extensibility and collaboration. For example, refactoring code to remove common blocks allows porting to multi-core architectures with increased thread safety while promoting best software engineering practices.By leveraging the existing capabilities of pxxxxxxxxxx (an xxxxxxx variant that supports xxxxxx) and xxxxxx (a xxxxxx xxxxxxted xxxxxxment Environment and xxxxxx plugin) we will be able to quickly contribute to the xxxxxx community, whos feedback we hope to use to guide our product development.	15751
Distributed Contact Solver for 3D Dynamics Simulation of Drive Systems with Defects, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	We propose a novel computational method for generating data needed to create decision strategies for condition-based monitoring algorithms that can effectively differentiate between a healthy system and different types of defects in a damaged system. Currently, the only means available to generate this data are physical testing which is time consuming and expensive, and simplified computer models- either lumped parameter models or 2D models. The most advanced current computational model of drive systems with surface and crack damage can only be deployed on stand-alone computers. The existing contact algorithm relies on shared memory between CPUs, and quickly saturates memory bandwidth. We propose innovative modifications to the algorithm so that models may be efficiently deployed on very large clusters of computers connected by high speed networks. These changes will make possible realistic time-domain 3D modeling of drive systems with surface and crack damage.	15752
PASSIVE WIRELESS MULTI-SENSOR TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE SENSING SYSTEM USING ACOUSTIC WAVE DEVICES, Phase I	2005-01-01	2018-07-19	This proposal describes the development of passive surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors and multi-sensor systems for xxxxxx application to remote wireless sensing of temperature and pressure distributions in space vehicles and demanding environments.  SAW devices are a mature technology used in numerous commercial wireless communication applications, satellites, and military systems. xxxxxxearch into the use of SAW devices as solid-state physical sensors is a relatively recent development, with potential emerging applications such as automotive tire pressure sensing.  Much of the work reported has focused on single sensor devices and systems, with little work done on dense multi-sensor systems.  The system proposed herein consists of multiple passive solid-state SAW sensors that can be interrogated remotely using RF signals, and that respond with a signal that encodes both the sensor's identity as well as measurements of temperature and pressure.  The proposed research will study several innovative aspects of SAW sensor technology, including: new piezoelectric materials which can operate over large temperature ranges; new SAW device embodiments for measurement of temperature and pressure and their wireless transmission in multi-sensor environments; transceiver design and optimization given the SAW operating parameters; and innovative packaging and antenna considerations for rugged, small devices.	15753

VEGA1 HALLEY FLYBY MAGNETOMETER DATA	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	On MARCH 6, 1986, AT 7:20:06 UT, the Vega spacecraft passed the nucleus of comet xxxxxx at a distance of 8,890 km with a relative velocity of 78 km/s. The magnetic field experiments MISCHA carried four fluxgate sensors, with three sensors mounted on a boom at the end of the solar panels and the fourth sensor mounted one meter closer. During the cruise phase, the TRASSA-1 mode of the instrument (1 vector/2.5 min) was used. The sensors were switched to the TRASSA-2 mode (1 vector/min) during the flyby which started roughly two days before the encounter.

Spacecraft Cabin Air CO2 Recovery, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	An advanced Environmental Control and Life Support xxxxxx (ECLSS) for long duration manned space missions ?such as planetary flight missions or planetary bases- requires an almost complete closure of all relevant material loops.  Energy efficient carbon dioxide (xxxxxx) removal and reduction systems are critical to reducing the power consumption of the spacecraft atmosphere revitalization systems.  TDA proposes to develop a rapidly cycling vacuum-assisted thermal swing adsorption (VTSA) system to remove xxxxxx from cabin air and concentrate it for subsequent reduction and pressurization.  Our unique sorbent exhibits one of the highest capacities reported for xxxxxx adsorption at very low xxxxxx partial pressures (1-3 torr xxxxxx partial pressure range).  The low heat of adsorption of xxxxxx on the sorbent and the relatively low heat input needed to desorb the xxxxxx across a small temperature differential during regeneration will reduce the power requirement for the process.  The new material is also highly tolerant to moisture.  In xxxxxx I, we will prepare the sorbent and demonstrate its ability in selectively removing xxxxxx from air under representative conditions.  The technology readiness level (xxxxxx) will be elevated to 3 at the end of xxxxxx  We will also complete the detailed design of the VTSA reactor.  In xxxxxx, we will build a high fidelity prototype assembly and demonstrate the concept at full-scale, elevating the xxxxxx to 5.	15763
In-Process Monitoring of Additive Manufacturing, Phase II	2017-11-01	2018-07-19	In xxxxxx I of this project MLPC, WSU, and AFIT were successfully able to identify several optical data features that are indicative of the quality of components built with the selective laser melting additive manufacturing process.  Four unique optical sensors were identified to collect this information and they include infrared and visible wavelength high-speed cameras and spectrometers.  The sensors used in xxxxxx I were very expensive, university developed, and produce very big data sets.  In this phase II proposal MLPC and their collaborators will continue this work by developing a new low-cost sensor system to specifically track key data features identified in xxxxxx  This sensor system will then be used to perform in-process quality monitoring and qualification of manufactured parts.  In xxxxxx this analysis will also be extended to electron beam freeform fabrication.  To complete the project MLPC, WSU, and AFIT will continue analysis of the xxxxxx I sensor data to identify more obscure process quality data, and develop process maps that correlate sensor output to part microstructure.  Then MLPC and AFIT will design and build the low-cost sensor system to track all key data, and test it on MLPCs custom build additive manufacturing test cell.  Next MLPC will perform the necessary programming and data processing to implement a process monitoring system that will show sensor data position on the process maps in real-time, thus enabling in-process quality assurance.  MLPC will then study and report the cost savings xxxxxx could gain with this technology.  Finally, MLPC will test this concept on an electron beam system and determine its viability for that process.  At the end of xxxxxx the xxxxxx will be 5, and this product will be ready for licensing for commercial use in existing additive manufacturing machines, and the MLPC developed additive manufacturing system will be available for licensing as a package unit with the integrated sensor system.	15764

Segmented Aperture Vacuum Nulling Telescope	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	The search for evidence of life on other planets is the major challenge in astronomy today. Imaging and characterizing Earth 2.0 will require a large aperture UV/xxxxxx/IR space telescope, such as the 8-12 meter, xxxxxxanced xxxxxx Large Aperture Segmented xxxxxx (ATLAST), a concept under development at GSFC. &nbsp;In this proposal we outline a key step in ATLAST&rsquo;s technology development roadmap, a segmented aperture, high-contrast testbed to demonstrate the capability of interferometric starlight suppression systems to achieve 10-10 contrast, and the control system required to maintain this contrast with a segmented mirror system.&nbsp; The objective of this project is to mature a large aperture telescope mission concept by initially demonstrating &le;10-8 high-contrast imaging, with a 2&lambda;/D inner working angle (IWA) on a segmented aperture system. The segmented aperture, high-contrast testbed will allow the evaluation of coronagraphs that function with arbitrary aperture shapes, such as the xxxxxx-Occulted xxxxxx Nulling xxxxxxgraph (PO-VNC), that will be used for the initial demonstration. The system can, however, be used to evaluate the performance of any coronagraph concept. The current technology focus in the coronagraph community is technology development dedicated to a filled-aperture telescope, namely AFTA/WFIRST.

Proof-of-concept and feasibility demonstrations for an avalanche photodiode/photoelastic modulator-based imaging polarimeter	2017-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxing on the successful heritage of xxxxxx xxxxxxangle xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx (xxxxxxI), we propose infusing xxxxxx avalanche photodiode (APD) array technology into the xxxxxxI camera architecture. This concept includes a custom readout integrated circuit (ROIC) that demodulates the 42 kHz waveform from a single photoelastic modulator (PEM) by sorting the APD charge pulses into 3 bins associated with each pixel, from which intensity I and xxxxxx parameters Q and U are derived. This innovation yields superior signal-to-noise performance and extends xxxxxxI polarimetry into the ultraviolet and midwave infrared, enabling characterization of high-altitude hazes and the vertical gradient of droplet sizes near the tops of liquid water clouds. These new capabilities are important because the recent slowdown in global mean surface temperature rise has been linked to stratospheric aerosols, and cloud-top droplet size information helps mitigate biases in microwave retrievals of precipitation rates. MSxxxxxx current dual-PEM approach requires two detector rows at any given wavelength to recover I, Q, and U (confining polarimetry to a few bands), and incurs a noise penalty that requires pixel averaging to improve performance and limits the polarimetric spectral range to the visible through shortwave infrared. The proposed technology eliminates one PEM from each camera, reduces mass, and recovers I, Q, and U at all UV-MWIR wavelengths with just one detector row in each band. We will validate this approach in the laboratory using a small APD array. To demonstrate the feasibility of meeting the speed, noise, and power constraints for a large pushbroom array, we will design and simulate the custom ROIC that performs the on-chip temporal multiplexing, and fabricate and test the critical pixel-level charge-sorting circuit. The entry level of this technology is xxxxxx 2. Our 32-month investigation will advance the overall demodulation approach to xxxxxx 3 and the in-pixel sorting circuit to xxxxxx 4.	15768

PEM water electrolyzers have already been proven space worthy and are commercially available at various scales. Our innovation enables the creation of polyethylene and other polymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates from the most basic starting materials: xxxxxx, water and electricity. In xxxxxx, xxxxxx will continue to improve performance of the xxxxxx conversion process and build a working prototype of ethylene and methane production that will serve as the basis for a future commercial device.	15769
Compact, Wavelength Stabilized Seed Source for Multi-Wavelength Lidar Applications, Phase II	2012-02-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx xxxxxx is developing a compact, multi-wavelength High xxxxxxl resolution xxxxxx (HSRL) system designed to measure various optical and microphysical properties of aerosols and clouds.  The HSRL system uses a high power, pulsed, seeded xxxxxxYAG laser, whose seed is wavelength-stabilized to an iodine vapor absorption line.  The primary goal of the xxxxxx effort is to provide a robust, next generation seed laser system which is significantly reduced in size, weight, and required \"wall-plug\" power for HSRL and other lidar applications.  This approach is enabled by use of a suitable compact laser diode source, together with xxxxxxR's integrated xxxxxxar xxxxxxwave Circuit (PLC) technology.  Furthermore, xxxxxxR's multi-element waveguide technology will be utilized in this xxxxxx effort to provide a compact 355nm source, derived from the same seed laser, for calibration of the HSRL UV interferometric filter.  A compact, next generation seed laser system utilizing xxxxxxR's PLC and UV technology, integrated with a high performance compact laser diode source will advance xxxxxx lidar systems due to its compact, efficient, and reliable design, thus enabling use on small aircraft and satellites."	15770
Embedding Procedure Assistance into Mission Control Tools, Phase II	2012-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxedures are the accepted means of commanding spacecraft. xxxxxxeduresencode the operational knowledge of a system as derived from systemexperts, testing, training and experience.  In current xxxxxx and xxxxxx operations procedures are displayed using applications separate from the applications used to display commands and telemetry.  This means that procedures cannot interact with commands and telemetry to help an operator's situation awareness.  This leads to slower procedure performance and greater opportunity for errors.  xxxxxx is building on existing xxxxxx Constellation program technology to combine procedures, commanding and telemetry into a single, consistent framework in which to operate space vehicles.   Instead of viewing procedures in static displays, flight controllers will have interactive, reconfigurable procedure displays and assistants that can be tailored for specific situations.  The displays will have different views tailored to specific operations, including browsing, assigning, editing, executing and monitoring procedures.  A procedure executive automates some procedure execution and provides procedure assistance.  Automation is always under the control of the flight controller via level of automation feature.  Each step or instruction of a procedure can be labeled as manual, automated or consent. This will increase the efficiency of procedure performance and reduce procedure errors.	15771
Night Rover Challenge	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The objective of the xxxxxx xxxxxx Challenge was to foster innovations in energy storage technology.

To enable practical system demonstrations of diverse design solutions by independent teams, xxxxxx I of this Challenge will be conducted in an ambient Earth environment. xxxxxx will entail testing energy storage systems in xxxxxx thermal and thermal-vacuum chambers to demonstrate applicability to the space and lunar environment. The xxxxxx I Challenge will be to demonstrate a portable energy storage system through two cycles of lunar daylight and darkness. xxxxxx will be for one lunar cycle. During the daylight period, systems will receive electrical energy from a simulated solar collector. During darkness, the stored energy will be used for simulated thermal management, scientific experimentation, communications, and rover movement. The competitors may store and extract the energy by any means they desire. A winning system must exceed the performance of a reference state-of-the-art system by a specified margin. The winning system would be the one that has the highest energy storage density. The available prize purse is $1.5 million. Completing this Challenge could enable: development of mobile systems to collect solar energy, store that energy, and later use it productively; innovations in energy storage technology for space operations and, in particular, to meet the demands imposed by the daylight/darkness cycle on the xxxxxx; and dual-use energy system innovations to benefit terrestrial applications, including vehicles and renewable energy generation systems.	15772

In the xxxxxx I program, solid state freeform (SFF) fabrication of high contrast 3D-gradient-index microlens array elements will be demonstrated using a research grade printer. A design of experiment will be conducted to optimize a series of 3D-GRIN films with axial, radial, and vertical gradient optical index patterns with microlenses of varying diameter, pitch, and focal length, including those symmetric and asymmetric. The films will be thoroughly characterized using optical coherent tomography and spectral interferometric techniques, and their power will be tested using collimated and converging light. A series of planar microlens arrays of varying shape, diameter, density, focal length will then be fabricated, and then planar films with two-surface microlens array, including masking, will be fabricated using the measured process parameters (i.e. &#916;n, &#916;n/(&#916;x,y,z), dispersion, etc.)	15773
Pneubotics - Membrane-Based Robotics for Remote Material Handling, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	We have invented a new class of robotics, called `Pneubotics', that rival current manipulators in payload and reach at 1/10th the weight. Our technology leverages insights into lightweight materials and mass manufacturing to create robots that derive power, structure, and movement from pressurized air. As a result, drive trains, motors, bearings, shafts, sliding surfaces, and excess structural material are eliminated, leading the way for robots that exhibit extremely high strength to weight ratios, inherent human safe operation, and high degrees of freedom at comparatively low part count. This transformative new technology has the potential to enable the widespread use of automated material handling on missions beyond low earth orbit. The compliant nature of these robotic systems allows them to robustly grasp arbitrarily shaped objects and make them ideal for operating around sensitive equipment or cooperatively with humans. Similarly, due to their fluidic architecture they can be deflated and stowed for efficient transport.  The work described in this phase I xxxxxx proposal aims to develop the key technological components that will allow the production of Pneubotic systems, including novel pressure vessel based fabric actuator design, a pneumatic power architecture that exceeds electromagnetic efficiency, and dynamic models of inflated fabric structures. These components will enable the construction of a full prototype manipulation system in phase II.	15774
Advanced Materials and Production Technology for Very Large Solar Sail Structures, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxar sails are an attractive means for propulsion of future spacecraft. One potential device for deploying and supporting very large solar sails is the CoilAble boom made by ATK xxxxxx xxxxxxs - Goleta (formally AEC-Able xxxxxxing). CoilAble's have a long and reliable track record in space. KaZaK Composites is a major developer and supplier of pultruded composite structural members used in CoilAble booms. For solar sail applications, it is important to develop advanced technologies that create the lightest possible booms. KaZaK is already pultruding advanced solar sail test hardware made with IM-9 carbon fiber as a first step toward improving solar sails. This xxxxxx proposal will identify a replacement for the recently out-of-production IM-9 baseline carbon fiber, and pursue three additional lines of investigation aimed at creating significant improvements in next generation solar sail structures. Specifically, we will investigate methods for making 1) near-zero CTE pultruded members of unlimited length via materials hybridization, 2) very lightweight tubular structures, with and without cores, to reduce the weight of solar sail longerons, and 3) passively damped structures achieved by additives to the matrix of pultruded composite sail materials. Mast structural elements made with least one and possibly several of these technologies will be prototyped and tested in xxxxxx	15775
Advanced Cookware and Techniques for Food Preparation at Reduced Pressure and Gravity, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop detailed design requirements for adapting COTS cooking appliances for meal preparation under xxxxxx 8 psia ambient conditions, and to produce one or more prototype devices required for a xxxxxx galley by modifying commercial off the shelf consumer kitchen appliances to hold Earth ambient pressure safely in an oxygen-enriched, 8 psi space habitat.  The modified devices will be use-tested to determine labor requirements for selected food preparation tasks in modified vs. unmodified equipment.  Finally, foods prepared at earth ambient pressure and 8 psi ambient pressure in the same equipment will be sensory tested to elucidate differences in flavor, texture, and overall acceptability.

Exploring the Model Design Space for Battery Health Management	2013-06-19	2018-07-19	xxxxxxtery Health Management (BHM) is a core enabling technology for the success and widespread adoption of the emerging electric vehicles of today. xxxxxxhough battery chemistries have been studied in detail in literature, an accurate run-time battery life prediction algorithm has eluded us. Current reliability-based techniques are insufficient to manage the use of such batteries when they are an active power source with frequently varying loads in uncertain environments. The amount of usable charge of a battery for a given discharge profile is not only dependent on the starting state-of-charge (SOC), but also other factors like battery health and the discharge or load profile imposed. This paper presents a xxxxxx Filter (PF) based BHM framework with plug-and-play modules for battery models and uncertainty management. The batteries are modeled at three different levels of granularity with associated uncertainty distributions, encoding the basic electrochemical processes of a Lithium-polymer battery. The effects of different choices in the model design space are explored in the context of prediction performance in an electric unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) application with emulated flight profiles.	15777
Precision Eddy Current Sensor for Nondestructive Evaluation of Spacecraft Structures, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx develops and manufactures complex high-performance structures for space applications. In order to mitigate risk to equipment and crew, xxxxxx needs nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques and sensors that are capable of detecting cracks and corrosion of structures when these defects reside below conducting and non-conducting surfaces. Eagle Harbor Technologies, xxxxxx. (EHT) is developing an eddy current NDE tool based their high gain integrator developed for fusion science applications. The high gain integrator sensitivity is comparable with superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDS), without the need for low temperature components. EHT proposes further evaluation and optimization to produce a NDE for xxxxxx applications.	15778

Electrostatic and Electrochemical Optimization of Electrospray Thrusters	2015-10-01	2018-07-19	Interest in small-satellite missions has grown recently, however there has been no propulsion technology capable of scaling down to meet mission needs. xxxxxxspray thrusters have this scalability in thrust, size, and mass, but achieving increased electrospray thrust density requires micro- and nano-scale component engineering. Recent work has produced thrusters operating at promising levels for near-future small-satellite missions. Improvements in performance must occur at the level of the propellant emission sites where physical properties can be optimized for specific mission requirements. An integrated model of electrospray emission for prediction of propulsive performance will be developed and tested. With a working model, various combinations of thruster properties can be examined to determine configurations which lead to desired performance regimes. Additionally, the application of electrospray thrusters to example mission architectures (station-keeping, orbital transfer, long-duration operation, etc.) will be investigated to determine the impact development in this area will have upon future space exploration.	15781

Data from Sustainability Base Characterizing Hot Water Pump Differential Pressure Spikes for ACCEPT	2016-01-15	2018-07-19	During the heating season in xxxxxx, a critical alarm associated with a hot water pump circulating heating water for the radiative system which exchanges heat via a geothermal heat pump was found. After further investigation it was ascertained that many such alarms were experienced throughout the entire heating season. These alarms are triggered as a result of the excursion of the hot water differential pressure outside of a nominal operating envelope for a fixed duration. There is a control system associated with regulating the hot water pump differential pressure to a fixed operating setpoint, and there are natural variations in the system that allow the pressure to be regulated and maintained within these nominal operating bounds. xxxxxxver, when system changes occur such as valves opening or closing to support the distribution of hot water through PVC piping to areas of the building where heating demand is called for in response to zone temperature requirements, the pump's operating speed must change accordingly to maintain this setpoint. If the pump speed does not change quickly enough to accommodate heating demand, these alarms can result and consequentially water hammer can occur, which may lead to accelerated aging of the PVC piping infrastructure as well as fittings, elbows, etc. In the worst case scenario it could cause leaking or bursting pipes.The zip file linked contains three subdirectories and a parameter list to be used for processing using xxxxxx. xxxxxxfiles are partitioned into training, validation, and testing sub-directory structures. A text file contains all parameter identifiers associated with the cold complaint prediction scenario. Please note that the parameter list is a text file containing the following lines:DCHWSSF - South Wing water flow rateDCHWSNF - xxxxxx Wing water flow rateDCHWDP - Hot Water xxxxxx Differential PressureDCHWP1SP - Hot Water xxxxxx Differential xxxxxxDCHWP1S - Hot Water xxxxxx Status IndicatorThe last parameter in this list is intended only to provide indication of ground truth (pump exceedances), and is not meant to construct models in xxxxxx. xxxxxx was collected from November 03, 2014 to February 03, 2015, and the alarm threshold limits of operation are flagged above 6.0 psid and below 4.5 psid. It should be noted the normal operation for the pump includes periods when it is off, when it retains a residual static pressure (~ 1.0 psid). The static binary indicator provides this information.	15783
Autonomous, Cryogenic Leak Detector for Improving Launch Site Operations, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	For detecting leakage of cryogenic fluids in spaceport facilities and in spacebound vehicles, this project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of an all-optical sensor that can be fitted into narrow orifices around plumbing junctions. Fast response time and complete reversibility in the detection range of 1 ppm to 100% for hydrogen will be demonstrated in xxxxxx  This technology will support xxxxxx goal of reducing vehicle and payload cost, and increase safety of ground and flight operations by measuring hydrogen in real-time and in situ.  The sensor's thermal shock resistance when exposed to cryogenic fluids will also be tested in xxxxxx  A prototype device will be engineered, field-tested and delivered to xxxxxx in xxxxxx.  Successful discussions have been conducted with industrial partners for commercialization support including xxxxxx follow-on funding for this project.  One major xxxxxx aerospace company has expressed strong interest in the proposed technology by providing a letter of support.  A technical team having 70 years of cumulative experience in developing commercially viable products has been assembled for this project.	15784
AirCore Reusable InSitu Sampler for CO2 and Trace Gas Measurements, Phase II	2016-10-01	2018-07-19	A novel design for an in situ air sampling sensor for xxxxxx and trace gases is proposed. The sensor, named xxxxxx, provides the advantages of existing in situ sensors (e.g. high resolution) but eliminates possible biases in analysis that often originate from imperfect measurement condition. The xxxxxx provides a significant savings in cost and weight while increasing the capabilities of existing in situ sensors. The xxxxxx system consists of the xxxxxx gas sampler and the support system to accomplish its high altitude (nominally 70,000+ ft.) mission. This support system includes the sensor launch and recovery components. The xxxxxx can be launched and recovered by a limited crew, which reduces the operational cost of the system.	15785
An Approach to Health Management and Sustainability for Critical Aircraft Systems, Phase I	2011-01-01	2018-07-19	Impact Technologies, in collaboration with the xxxxxx Institute of xxxxxx and its industrial partners, proposes to develop and demonstrate innovative technologies to integrate anomaly detection and failure prognosis algorithms into automated fault mitigation strategies for advanced aircraft controls. Traditional reactive fault tolerant control approaches fail to provide optimal fault mitigation over a long period of time to guarantee the integrity of the platform for the mission duration. We will create a generic simulation environment to demonstrate fault detection and progression at the component level, using electromechanical actuators as a testbench.  The proposed xxxxxxxxMitigation system accepts sensor inputs, extracts features from raw data and employs an anomaly detection module to determine the presence of an anomaly with performance guarantees; a prognostic routine, built on xxxxxxian estimation (particle filtering) techniques to estimate the remaining useful life of the component; finally, a mitigation strategy trades off between performance and control authority to extend the life of the failing component until the mission is completed. This innovative prognostics-enhanced approach to fault mitigation uses xxxxxx xxxxxx Control techniques running in real time. xxxxxx algorithms will be implemented on embedded systems and used in hardware-in-the-loop demonstrations.	15786

Fast Readout for Large Area Photon-Counting Infrared Detectors, Phase II	2009-03-01	2018-07-19	Many xxxxxx space and Earth programs in the infrared range 1060-1550 nm are limited by the detector performance that require long exposure time due to their low sensitivity and/or high noise. Large format infrared photon counting arrays with ranging capability would provide a valuable tool to many space missions. Current state of the art fabrication of photon counting infrared detector arrays on non-silicon semiconductors is not mature enough to monolithically integrate complex readout circuitry at pixel level and large format array multiplexing. We proposed to develop novel fast readout integrated circuits (ROIC) to be integrated with large photon-counting infrared detector arrays into 3D imaging cameras with photon-counting sensitivity. These new cameras would support xxxxxx missions in applications such as space docking, landing, remote mapping, and robotic vision.The goal of this program is to develop smart-pixel ROIC arrays in silicon with enhanced radiation tolerance, ready for hybrid integration with large infrared photon-counting avalanche photodiode arrays, that will enable large-area detectors with short integration time, sub-nanosecond timing resolution, and on-pixel logic.In xxxxxx I, we have simulated, implemented, and successfully validated all the blocks of a ROIC array specifically developed for operation with infrared photon-counting arrays.In xxxxxx, we will improve, fabricate and qualify ROIC arrays with integrated timing functions at pixel level and capable of integration in flip-chip technology with large infrared photon counting detector arrays.	15788
Balancing Autonomous Spacecraft Activity Control with an Integrated Scheduler-Planner and Reactive Executive, Phase II	2017-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx and remote vehicle operations demand a high level of responsiveness in dynamic environments.  During operations it is possible for unexpected events and anomalies to disrupt the mission schedule, and in the case of critical faults, even threaten the health and safety of the spacecraft.    The planner's relatively slow response time to unexpected events (changes in resource levels, failed activity indications, flight software fault indications) during dynamic and critical operations means that it does not suffice as a sole solution to the vehicle autonomy when the primary purpose is to keep it safe and ensure mission success.  Mission success can also be enhanced through the use of a sequence engine that provides reactive capabilities. Traditional sequence engines execute commands without regard to the overall safety of the vehicle.  Through the use of a reactive sequence engine that utilizes State xxxxxx technology vehicle further enhances safety and the probability of mission success. The xxxxxxted Scheduler-xxxxxxner And Reactive Executive (I-SPAREX) architecture utilizes a layered software architecture (an approach proven successful on previously flown autonomous demonstration missions such as EO-1) and incorporates an existing goal-based, planning solution as well as an advanced, real-time, decision-making sequence engine. Specifically, we plan to study and demonstrate the feasibility of integrating xxxxxx xxxxxx CASPER (Continuous Activity xxxxxx xxxxxxning Execution and Re-planning) as the Continuous xxxxxxning xxxxxx (CPL), and VML 3.0 (Virtual xxxxxx xxxxxxuage) as the Reactive Sequencing xxxxxx (RSL) providing programmable heuristic control.  We choose to focus on CASPER and VML in this proposal, given the demonstrated flight heritage of both components.	15789

Efficient Keyword-Based Search for Top-K Cells in Text Cube	2012-01-27	2018-07-19	Previous studies on supporting free-form keyword queries over RDBMSs provide users with linked-structures (e.g.,a set of joined tuples) that are relevant to a given keyword query. Most of them focus on ranking individual tuples from one table or joins of multiple tables containing a set of keywords. In this paper, we study the problem of keyword search in a data cube with text-rich dimension(s) (so-called text cube). The text cube is built on a multidimensional text database, where each row is associated with some text data (a document) and other structural dimensions (attributes). A cell in the text cube aggregates a set of documents with matching attribute values in a subset of dimensions. We define a keyword-based query language and an IR-style relevance model for coring/ranking cells in the text cube. Given a keyword query, our goal is to find the top-k most relevant cells. We propose four approaches, inverted-index one-scan, document sorted-scan, bottom-up dynamic programming, and search-space ordering. The search-space ordering algorithm explores only a small portion of the text cube for finding the top-k answers, and enables early termination. Extensive experimental studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches. xxxxxx:  B. xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and xxxxxx, “Efficient xxxxxx-xxxxxx for Top-K Cells in xxxxxx,” IEEE Transactions on xxxxxx and xxxxxx xxxxxxing, 2011.	15791

An Optimality Metrics Reporting Toolkit for SMART NAS, Phase II	2018-04-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx project aims to develop a software module for the SMART NAS xxxxxx (or another similar simulation environment) that allows an apples-to-apples comparison of system performance across scenarios and a comparison to a 'best possible' case. The module, named xxxxxx (Toolkit for xxxxxximality Metrics Overlay), is a metrics toolkit for comparing SMART NAS simulation runs to the optimal decisions that should be made/should have been made relative to a selected metric to help compare the performance of the scenario being simulated to a best possible outcome, either in shadow-mode or in post-operations mode. The output from xxxxxx is not only a normalized metric, but the 4-D trajectories of all aircraft in an optimally-performing system.A key component to the success of any simulation environment is the quality of the metrics that it is able to report back to a user to allow informed decision-making. xxxxxx addresses the need to develop metrics that are comparable across scenarios by computing a 'baseline' for each scenario that represents the best that the system could perform given the operating constraints, weather, and demand. By normalizing metrics relative to this baseline, it allows for more direct comparisons across scenarios along multiple dimensions both in shadow mode and playback scenarios. When used in shadow mode, xxxxxx will identify the actions that should be taken to optimize for a given objective.In addition to computing the metrics, xxxxxx's output includes descriptive information on how the trajectories in the scenario being simulated differ from those in the optimal solution, and provides insight into how system performance may be improved.	15793

Ultrafast Laser Material Processing: Welding, Drilling, and Waveguide Inscription	2017-07-01	2018-07-19	This CIF represents an initial effort to leverage current university-based research for an advanced, micron level manufacturing technique suitable for sensors and miniature components for instruments. xxxxxx to this process is tight control of an xxxxxxfast (150 femtosecond) laser. This technique also has a direct path to enhancing the new and exciting area of photonics integrated circuits (PIC). Future opportunities such as ESTO’s xxxxxx, IIP, EVIs, EVM’s, xxxxxxs’ PIDD, MatiSSE, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, etc. will require more advanced laser instrumentation to meet their science requirements. These systems would, for example, need new wavelengths for generation via nonlinear optical frequency conversion, addition of a highly sophisticated PIC to realize tunable/single frequency laser sources, and “optical features” such as volume xxxxxx gratings that act as end reflectors or spectral control mechanism in laser resonator. This new laser fabrication technology could be instrumental in enabling such developments. PICs would help in integration of electro-optics components in a small package thus reducing size, weight and power (SWaP) for resource-limited missions. Near term goals are to demonstrate glass-to-metal welding  and micromachining shortly thereafter.	15795
Autonomous Collaborative Agents for Onboard Multi-Sensor Re-Targeting, Phase II	2008-01-01	2018-07-19	In our xxxxxx I effort we developed a prototype software-agent based framework to provide for autonomous re-targeting of sensors hosted on satellites in polar orbits, subject to standing requests and dynamic user requests.  Our approach is a distributed and de-centralized, with each satellite maintaining knowledge of its sensor complement and physical capabilities as well as its schedule. Each satellite is capable of entering into negotiations for a viewing opportunity via a Contract Net type protocol; and is capable of optimizing its bid.  As sensor deployment increases and autonomous vehicles become more robust, the need for a framework to support multi-sensor re-targeting in a dynamic environment involving multiple organizations becomes more acute. In our xxxxxx 2 effort, we will extend the framework to include support for multiple types of sensor platforms as well as more sophisticated variants of the Contract Net Protocol. We will define various agent 'templates' specialized to the needs of the multi-sensor re-targeting environment. In xxxxxx 2, the improved framework, AAMSRT, will support policy utilization to govern the sensor re-tasking. As part of the xxxxxx 2 effort, we will engage the Open xxxxxx Consortium for applicable standards, including use of xxxxxxML, services, and OGC initiatives regarding sensor planning.	15796

FINE-FILAMENT MAGNESIUM DIBORIDE SUPERCONDUCTOR WIRE FOR TURBOELECTRIC PROPULSION SYSTEMS, Phase II	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx xxxxxx proposal overcomes technology barriers for developing highly efficient all electric aircraft systems for the future, with limited impact to the environment. xxxxxx propulsion for aircraft applications is envisioned, and cryogenic and superconducting components are sought. In particular, low AC loss superconducting wires for the stator windings and superconducting wires with filaments less than 10 micrometers in diameter are of interest. There is an intense push in the aircraft industry to ultimately develop an all-electric aircraft, with liquid hydrogen and fuel cells being considered as the prime generation source for aircraft propulsion. The xxxxxx is in competition with Europe for the development the next generation all-electric aircraft.  Superconductivity especially magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconductors are considered an enabling technology that is being investigated by xxxxxx, Air Force, Rolls-Royce, Airbus and EADS.  This means the need for a low cost, low AC loss (fine filament superconductor) that can operate in the 10-25K temperature range in 0-2 tesla fields for superconducting stators for motors and generators.  This wire is need by 2016-2017 time frame so all cryogenic motors and generators can fabricated and tested in the xxxxxx test bed.  In the xxxxxx I Hyper Tech has shown that fine filament MgB2 wires can be fabricated and there is potential for low AC losses in the 60-400 Hz range for stators.  In the xxxxxx Hyper Tech will continue to work on developing, manufacturing, and testing fine filament MgB2 wire.  The wires will also be twisted to reduce coupling losses.  The wires will be tested for their superconductor and engineering current density and AC losses.  The result of this work will be a low AC loss MgB2 superconductor wire for enabling all-electric aircraft development and allow the xxxxxx industry to lead the world in this needed and rapid developing technology.	15798

Ultra-Lightweight Nanocomposite Foams and Sandwich Structures for Space Structures Applications, Phase II	2009-11-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx structures that are ultra-lightweight, and have gas barrier property, space durability, radiation resistance, EMI shielding, and high impact resistance are desirable to improve the reliability and provide a safe resting environment for astronauts and electronic equipment housing and protection. Some of the components currently in use such as stations or habitats use double-wall thick films with high internal pressure. xxxxxxnic housings made of metals are heavy and need improved EMC protection. Some components are in thin film form and the specific rigidity and dimensional stability needs improvement.  Components of landers and vehicles are subject to dust impact.

High-Resolution Detector for At-Wavelength Metrology of X-Ray Optics, Phase II	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	Since the launch of the first X-ray focusing telescope in 1963, the development of grazing incidence X-ray optics has been crucial to the development of the field of X-ray astronomy.  The recent Decadal Survey also highlights the important contribution that X-ray astronomy can make in addressing some of the most pressing scientific questions about black holes, cosmology and the ebb and flow of energy and matter in the evolving universe, and recognizes the research needed to mature the key enabling technology of X-ray optics.  The proposed development directly addresses this need by providing a unique detector designed specifically to support the development of the next generation of X-ray telescopes, which will allow researchers and engineers to characterize such X-ray telescopes with high accuracy, and thereby optimize their performance and best utilize their gathered data.  By the end of the xxxxxx program we will have developed a fully calibrated detector ready for use at various facilities, including xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Center (MSFC) and other xxxxxx-funded research centers such as the Harvard-xxxxxxsonian Center for xxxxxx and xxxxxx xxxxxxersity.

Advanced Aqueous Phase Catalyst Development using Combinatorial Methods, Phase II	2013-05-01	2018-07-19	Combinatorial methods are proposed to develop advanced Aqueous Oxidation xxxxxxs (AOCs) with the capability to mineralize organic contaminants present in effluents from current and future primary wastewater treatment processes at temperatures less than 70aC, pressures below 20 psig, and contact times under 30 minutes.  xxxxxx effort will build upon the successful xxxxxx I feasibility demonstration and identify rate-limiting factors for contaminant oxidation identified in the best xxxxxx I AOCs.  A new series of combinatorial catalysts will be prepared with the goal to systematically improve catalyst performance.  Improvements will focus on contaminant and reaction byproduct adsorption, mass transfer resistances, and reaction rate limitations associated with noble metal concentration, dispersion, and support interaction.  A second-generation combinatorial library with 102 AOCs will be prepared based on this analysis.  Oxidation activity will then be compared using a difficult to oxidize ersatz solution containing contaminants known to occur in the current xxxxxx water processor aboard the xxxxxx.  These tests will select the best AOC based upon analysis of oxidation kinetics.  This AOC will undergo long-term testing to verify performance.  Scale-up activities will follow, resulting in a full-scale, deliverable prototype.  The advanced AOC will lower water processor ESM and provide multiple commercial opportunities.	15807
Passively Powered and Programmable Sensor-RFID for ISHM Systems, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	To date there are several approaches for incorporating sensing capabilities into RFID. xxxxxx tags use batteries to power their communication circuitry, sensors, and microcontroller. xxxxxx tags benefit from relatively long wireless range and can achieve high data and sensor activity rates. xxxxxxver, the batteries required by active tags are disadvantageous for device cost, lifetime, weight, and volume.  In contrast, passive sensor tags receive all of their operating power from external RF transmitting sources and are not limited by battery life.  One attractive feature of passive sensor tags is the prospect of permanently embedding them in objects for structural monitoring. Another is their suitability for applications in which neither batteries nor wired connections are feasible, for weight, volume, cost, or other reasons. A limitation of purely passive sensor tags is the requirement of proximity to a RF transmitter.  Since lower power consumption is one major trend in RF circuit design, a self-powered system by means of energy harvesting becomes very attractive. It can serve as the enabling technology for novel applications such as ambient intelligence. Using a power harvesting technique for wireless rechargeable battery smart sensor and enhanced RFID are the key elements for successfully distributing sensors across sensor networks.	15808
Liquid Crystal Elastomer Membranes and the Wrinkling Instability	2018-08-01	2018-07-19	In its technology roadmap, xxxxxx has expressed a desire to develop tailorable materials to better enable design and deployment of lightweight, efficient space structures.  For instance, lightweight, easily deployable and inflatable reflectors have garnered particular interest to replace conventional unwieldy mirrors for use on space probes.  Recent attempts to utilize polymer membrane technology as deployable substrate for a reflector have faced many technical hurdles: one limitation has been achieving the high surface accuracy required; another has been the presence of surface wrinkling under the complex boundary conditions necessary to pull the membrane taut.We conjecture that the wrinkling phenomenon can be limited or even suppressed completely by utilizing a novel polymer based xxxxxx Crystal Elastomer material as constituent for the membrane.  Consequently, we propose to research the mechanics of xxxxxx Crystal Elastomer membranes, with emphasis on understanding the wrinkling behavior exhibited by these structures. We believe the prospect of developing a wrinkle-free membrane utilizing this material is exciting, and merits the attention and funding of xxxxxx as it seeks to update its space technology infrastructure with innovative lightweight structures and tailorable materials. In a broader context, the interplay between structural and material non-linearities highlighted by this proposed research raises fundamental questions in mechanics worthy of thesis.In the proposal, we will show a scaling argument that supports the hypothesis.  We  then propose to develop a numerical scheme that can accurately capture wrinkling mechanics as well as the material nonlinearities of liquid crystal elastomers.  This will enable us to investigate realistic space structure geometries, as well as novel complex shapes only possible due to use of liquid crystal elastomer material.  We also propose a clamped stretching experiment to further validate our claims.	15809

"Bringing 3D Memory Cubes to Space: a \"Rad-Hard by Design Study\" with an Open Architecture, Phase I"	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	The computing capabilities of onboard spacecraft are a major limiting factor for accomplishing many classes of future missions. xxxxxxhough technology development efforts are underway that will provide improvements to spacecraft CPUs, they do not address the limitations of current onboard memory systems. In addition to CPU upgrades, effective execution of data-intensive operations such as terrain relative navigation, hazard detection and avoidance, autonomous planning and scheduling, and onboard science data processing and analysis require high-bandwidth, low-latency memory systems to maximize processor usage (the memory wall) and provide rapid access to observational data captured by high-data-rate instruments (e.g., Hyperspectral xxxxxx xxxxxx, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture xxxxxx).3D ICs, after a long wait, is now a reality. The first mainstream product is 3D memory cubes, where multiple memory tiers (4 DRAM tiers as of 2015) are vertically integrated to offer manifold improvement in size, capacity, speed, and power consumption compared with 2D counterparts. Indeed, these are the memory parts that will truly enable aforementioned missions. Unfortunately, none of these are ready for space. The purpose of this research is to investigate the challenges and opportunities in deploying 3D memory cubes into space missions.	15811

Autonomus I&C Maintenance and Health Monitoring System for Fission Surface Power, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	There currently exists no end-to-end reactor/power conversion monitoringsystem that can provide both autonomous health monitoring, but alsoin-situ sensor calibration and response time testing without humaninterface.  One of the key challenges facing space nuclear power systemsis their extremely remote location and requirement for multi-yearmissions.  The current benchmark system has a mission life of at least 8years during which time there is no opportunity for repair, sensorcalibrations, or any maintenance of any kind.  By contrast,terrestrial-based nuclear power plants undergo periodic outages duringwhich time sensor calibrations can be performed.  Current technologyrelies heavily on real-time human interaction, monitoring and control.Due to the long communication times between the Earth and xxxxxx, or xxxxxx,real-time human control is not possible.  Therefore, these emergingprograms have a critical need to develop autonomous health monitoringand control technology. xxxxxx and Measurement Services Corporationproposes to develop a modular signal processing platform that willenable robust system monitoring.  The proposed system, once fullydeveloped, will be able to detect system anomalies, based on advancedanalytical and empirical analysis and will enable autonomous reactoroperation and corrective action.	15813

Leidenfrost Driven Waste-Water Separator	2021-08-01	2018-07-19	A xxxxxx Driven xxxxxx-Water Separator (LDS) is proposed in response to TA 6.1: Environmental Control and Life Support xxxxxxs and xxxxxxion xxxxxxs. The LDS aims to provide a solution to the problems of waste management (TA 6.1.3), and water recovery and management (TA 6.1.2), as identified by xxxxxx. The LDS will take advantage of the xxxxxx effect, which is a phenomenon experienced by a liquid when it comes into close vicinity of a surface that is significantly hotter than the liquid's boiling temperature. Instant evaporation causes the formation of an insulating vapor layer that allows the liquid to float. This effect is what is responsible for floating droplets of water on a hot skillet. In the microgravity of space, liquids impacting a superheated surface are able to rebound due to this insulating vapor layer formation. The LDS will take advantage of a nozzle that will eject droplets of human waste into a channel of superheated walls made of superhydrophobic materials. These ejected droplets will propagate through the system channel, rebounding off the walls and becoming smaller and smaller as a result of water evaporation. xxxxxx waste left over from the solution will leave the channel to be stored. The water vapor left over in the channel will be extracted out of the system. xxxxxxearch into microgravity fluid phenomenon is critical for the development of the proposed xxxxxx Driven xxxxxx-Water Separator. This research can be effectively conducted in xxxxxx at xxxxxx State xxxxxxersity. xxxxxxearch includes investigations into the impact of different surface materials on the separation of water and solid waste, variations in the rate of evaporation due to surface material and superheat, and effects of droplet ejection methods on overall effectiveness of the system. These areas of interest must be investigated for effective development of the LDS. xxxxxxs used to develop superhydrophobic materials, rapid prototyping equipment, and a machine shop with welding stations means that the LDS can be designed and fabricated at PSU.The xxxxxx Driven xxxxxx-Water Separator is a system that not only offers a solution to TA6.1.2 and TA6.1.3, but it also opens avenues for research that can provide meaningful insights into the development of other space technologies. As stated earlier, the research into microgravity fluid mechanics must be conducted in order to design an effective LDS. xxxxxxults from the conducted research can be used to help aid in the design of other systems for space because of the fact that many systems used in space interact with and make use of fluids. The LDS provides the opportunity to develop a system that can solve the problem of waste-water separation, as well as provide an avenue for meaningful research into microgravity fluid mechanics.	15815

In Situ Polymerization via Environmentally-Borne Initiation Stimuli	2019-08-01	2018-07-19	The goal of my research is to develop novel polymeric materials that solidify upon exposure to an environmentally-borne initiation stimulus. Specifically, I propose the investigation of novel, in situ polymerizable materials based upon the radical-mediated thiol-ene reaction mechanism. This reaction mechanism has been a focus of recent attention as a click reaction, particularly for polymerizations, owing to its desirable combination of characteristics, including high yield, reaction specificity, and modularity. As thiol-ene reactions are extraordinarily resistant to oxygen inhibition, oxygen will be employed as a ubiquitous, environmentally-borne reactant. This mechanism will enable the development of materials that improve upon existing technologies used in the human habitation of space.The described research project will focus both on the fundamental chemistry and evolution of the polymer networks, and on the utilization of the polymerization initiation approach to yield materials that address the requirements of specific applications. Redox reaction mechanisms that utilize atmospheric oxygen to generate radicals will be investigated for the in situ polymerization of thiol-ene-based materials and the physicochemical properties of the resultant polymer networks will be characterized. To demonstrate the versatility of this approach, its utilization in two space technology applications will be investigated. Initially, surgical adhesives will be developed for use as emergency hemostats and other medical procedures that may be necessary to perform during space travel. xxxxxxly, a self-healing material that is able to flow and polymerize immediately after being punctured, thus sealing a wall defect, will be designed as a unique and robust atmosphere-loss prevention mechanism; such a material could be sandwiched within the layers of space suits or the walls of a spacecraft.	15817

Power Management for A Distributed Wireless Health Management Architecture	2013-05-09	2018-07-19	Distributed wireless architectures for prognostics is an important enabling step in prognostic research in order to achieve feasible real-time system health management. A significant problem encountered in implementation of such architectures is power management. In this paper, we present robust power management techniques for a generic health management architecture that involves diagnostics and prognostics for a system comprising multiple heterogeneous components. Our power management techniques are based on online dynamic monitoring of the sensor battery discharge profile which enables accurate predictions of when the device should be put into low power modes. In our architecture, low power mode is achieved by run-time sampling rate modification through sleep states. Our experiments with a cluster of smart sensors for a hybrid diagnostics and prognostics architecture show significant gains in power management without severe loss in performance.	15821

Advanced Reentry Aeroheating Simulation Framework, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	Vehicle reentry presents numerous challenges that must be carefully addressed to ensure the success of current and future space exploration missions. As they enter the atmosphere, these vehicles are subjected to extreme hypersonic environments typified by large structural loads, high heat fluxes and temperatures, and an aggressive aerothermal environment where nonequilibrium dissociated gases may cause chemical ablation at the vehicle's surface. These hypersonic flows involve highly nonlinear fluid-thermal interactions such as very strong shocks, high aeroheating, and shock boundary layer interactions.

The envisioned xxxxxx I program will develop an innovative digital readout integrated circuit architecture that will increase resolution and provide improved sensitivity.

Integration of an Advanced Cryogenic Electric Propulsion System (ACEPS) to Aerodynamically Efficient Subsonic Transport Aircraft, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	This proposal defines innovative aerodynamic concepts and technology goals aimed at vehicle efficiency for future subsonic aircraft in the 2020 -- 2030 timeframe.  Noise, emissions and fuel burn are all vehicle efficiency concerns which can be addressed by aerodynamic concepts either on the component, subsystem, or aircraft design system level.  In line with the xxxxxx, an assumption is made that by 2025, higher air traffic demand (2-3 times the 2004 level) will require a significant increase in airport throughput, improved air traffic control procedures, and a significant decrease in noise.Empirical xxxxxxs xxxxxx (ESAero) has a design and analysis team to address high risk/high pay-off technologies on the aircraft aerodynamics concept level and airframe/propulsion integration to dramatically reduce noise, pollution, and fuel burn in the 2020-2030 timeframe.  The key technology for these breakthroughs is the use of an advanced cryogenically-cooled electric propulsion system installed in advanced unconventional aircraft configurations.  An important feature of this study is to understand and evaluate the impact of this propulsion system on the design and aerodynamic performance of the total aircraft.  In addition, ESAero will examine the applicability of STOL performance to potential improvements in airport throughput using multiple configuration and aerodynamic performance concepts.	15846

Stable Calcium Isotopes in Urine as a Biomarker of Bone Mineral Balance in Spaceflight	2017-11-01	2018-07-19	The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate whether the relationship between bone mineral balance (BMB) and changes in the natural isotope composition of blood and urine observed in xxxxxxbased bed rest studies could also be observed in crewmembers in spaceflight, providing the basis for inflight measurements of BMB and evaluation of effectiveness of bone loss countermeasures in individual crewmembers.    We have achieved this goal. xxxxxxhough not all of our analyses are completed, analysis of archived urine samples from 32 crewmembers from previous xxxxxx missions clearly shows the same pattern of change in Ca isotope composition observed in bed rest and predicted in spaceflight. More specifically, the 44Ca:42Ca ratio in urine (expressed as d44/42Ca) typically drops to below each crewmember’s individual average pre-flight value shortly after spaceflight begins, remains low during spaceflight, and returns to pre-flight values upon return to Earth. This is the pattern expected in crewmembers transitioning to more negative BMB in microgravity, and a confirmation of our ability to detect this change using Ca isotopes.    A great deal more information can be extracted from the Ca isotope data we have gathered, a task that we have begun and will be our primary activity during the remainder of the project. xxxxxxes in Ca isotope composition are revealing details of the dynamics of BMB on previously inaccessible timescales, and offer new insights into bone biology. In particular, while on Ca isotopes show what on average crewmembers lose bone during spaceflight, our data reveal striking differences between the responses of individual crewmembers. Some of these differences are related to countermeasures. For example, crewmembers treated with both bisphosphonate and xxxxxxanced xxxxxxistive Exercise (ARED) uniformly showed not bone loss, while the response of crewmembers treated with exercise alone was more variable: most lost bone, some did not. xxxxxx in response to treatment do not appear to be related to age, sex, or BMI (body mass index). The cause of these variations is of great interest, and we hope that further analysis will shed light on this and other questions. We do anticipate, however, that the answers to many questions will require more data from future projects.    A secondary goal of our project was to increase the speed with which samples could be processed and analyzed. This goal is, of course, a moving target. xxxxxx speed can always be increased, but we have made substantial improvements over where we were at the start of the project. We designed and validated an automated column chromatography procedure for faster and cleaner sample purification prior to analysis, and have validated a new microwave digestion system for improved sample digestion is now 80% complete. In addition,  we are in the process of developing an improved mass spectrometric analytical procedure using a 46Ca-43Ca double spike, which should improve data quality, accuracy, and precision.    Finally, we have begun exploring new technology to measure Ca isotope ratios using laser fluorescence rather than conventional mass spectrometry. Conventional mass spectrometers are not suited to either inflight or widespread clinical use. Such instruments are large, difficult or impossible to miniaturize, complex, and expensive, problems that could be overcome by using laser fluorescence. Whether a practical laser fluorescence device can be built remains to be seen, but preliminary results are promising, and efforts to build small and simple devices for measuring other isotopes (C and O) have been successful.	15848

High-Efficiency, High-Power Laser Transmitter for Deep-Space Communication, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	There is demand for vastly improved deep space satellite communications links.  As data rates dramatically increase due to new sensor technologies and the desire to pack even more sensors on spacecraft, it is imperative that new solutions be compact in size, light in weight, be high speed, and highly power efficient.  Traditional RF links suffer 1/r2 losses, resulting in low received power, thereby limiting overall data rates. xxxxxx has recognized optical links offer potential improvements in power and in size due to a substantially narrower beam and smaller components. An ideal technology for such links is a laser transmitter master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) using pulse position modulation techniques.  Previous work has demonstrated laser transmitter MOPAs up to 100 MHz with wall plug efficiencies up to 18.9% and operating at 1064nm which requires bulky optical components. There still is room for improvement utilizing additional techniques to further increase efficiency and size reduction. This proposal addresses these improvements using several techniques.	15853
In-flight Sorting of BNNTs by Aspect Ratio	2017-07-01	2018-07-19	The key technical challenges are: (a) mechanical sorting is ineffective for nanoscale product, (b) BNNTs are non-conductive and the agglomeration tendency is strong, and (c) organic solvents damage BNNTs. Consequently, cyclone separator technology will be a good initiation point, but electrostatic or triboelectric precipitator technology offers the most potential. In the more mature CNT production industry, dry cyclonic techniques operating at elevated temperatures are already employed. xxxxxxver, the CNT material accumulates as a single entity, and sorting of the end product by mass, size, or shape has not been implemented.The key objectives for the first year are an extensive literature review to compare/contrast promising techniques. External collaborators will actively be sought from academia and industry. As concepts are developed, a White Paper will be published and a xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx will be filed. A plan will be formulated for a Tier 2 effort, which will define the research required for technology advancement.	15854
Robust Propulsion Control for Improved Aircraft Safety, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxentific xxxxxx, xxxxxx. proposes to develop a robust propulsion control approach to facilitate control law design and simulation-based validation. The proposed approach integrates system identification and robust control design, specifically tailors it to handle large perturbations and model uncertainties affecting engine operations, and provides a framework for successive design optimization through iterations.  The integrated and iterative design methodology will reduce the cycle time in propulsion control design and validation to maintain engine operations in the presence of adverse conditions, such as engine icing, foreign object damage, and high angle of attack. In xxxxxx I, A proof-of-concept (POC) simulation will be conducted to demonstrate the merit of the robust control approach in the presence of larger than normal variations in the design model. The control design and closed-loop POC will use the xxxxxx-developed C-MAPSS generic engine model as the simulation framework. The anticipated benefits of the proposed innovation are to reduce design cycle time and increase robustness of the controller design, while optimizing the closed-loop system performance.	15855

Vibrational Locomotion Enabling Subsurface Exploration of Unconsolidated Regolith	2012-10-01	2018-07-19	Proposed effort is to use vibration to propel a small, self-contained device through unconsolidated (loose, granular) material, such as regolith. Small scale robotic devices that can penetrate, and be mobile within, the regolith depth would offer unique opportunities.The idea of vibrational locomotion is based on vibrational-fluidization in ISRU reactor systems, which has proven very effective for regolith mixing. The vibrating device would essentially vibro-fluidize the local regolith surrounding it, reducing the local bulk density. With proper design (size, shape, weight) the device could gradually sink into the regolith. xxxxxx is also used in industrial digging applications as a supplement to a constant forward force. The vibration helps to reduce friction between the soil and the digging tool. xxxxxxluding a percussive motion to the proposed device would produce such a downward force and mimic industrial techniques.	15862

ALD Sapphire Coating for Large Area Soft X-ray Mirrors	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	This proposed work is to demonstrate that the already established ALD coating method can be applied to the X-ray mirror fabrication and is suitable to produce an additional thin layer on X-ray reflectors. All the soft X-ray mirrors previously flown employed a heavy metal coating, such as Ir, Au, and Pt, in order to increase the upper limit of their sensitive energy band beyond 10 keV. xxxxxxver, it is known that such a heavy element is not optimal for the softer X-ray reflection &lt; ~7 keV. The heavy element has a high electron density, which is ideal to reflect X-rays, but also attenuates them during the reflection process. The heavy element also creates absorption edge structures in the mirror effective area energy response, particularly a big sharp drop around the L absorption edge around 2 keV. It has been suggested by many people that a thin light element layer, such as Ni, Cu, C, etc., on top of the heavy element can enhance the effective area as well as eliminate the L-edge structure. Only a very thin layer is required for this enhancement, but a&nbsp;segmented X-ray mirror contains&nbsp;thousands of reflectors inside.&nbsp;An additional complication tends to be avoided for the flight project. On the other hand, the ALD coating method can in principle coat many substrates simultaneously with precise thickness control. This will not take much cost and schedule of the flight project. In this task, we will use xxxxxx which can provide a stable and robust reflecting surface. We intend to demonstrate that the ALD can produce uniform thickness over the large surface&nbsp;area and among multiple reflectors in one coating run.	15864
Fourier Transform Spectrometer	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx Transform xxxxxx project demonstrates the efficacy of a miniaturized spectrometer for flight applications.A spectrometer is an instrument used to measure properties of light to identify materials in the electromagnetic spectrum. The variable measured is usually the light's intensity.  The independent variable is usually the wavelength of the light or a unit directly proportional to the photon energy, such as wavenumber or electron volts. A spectrometer is used in spectroscopy for producing spectral lines and measuring their wavelengths and intensities from gamma rays and X-rays into the far infrared. The challenge addressed by this project is how to minimize the size of a spectrometer to address mass and weight issues for space flight projects.  The results of this project will be the basis for a new spectrometer design.  	15865

A Thermal-Electrically Cooled Quantum-Dot Middle-Wave Infrared Photodetector with High Quantum Efficiency and Photodetectivity, Phase I	2010-01-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxdle-wave infrared (xxxxxx, 3.2-3.6 m) photodetectors with a high specific photodetectivity (D*) are of great importance in xxxxxx lidar and remote sensing applications. xxxxxxver, existing MWIR photodetectors are required to be operated at low temperature of below 77K to achieve high photodetectivity (D*). The requirement for cryogenic cooling systems adds cost, weight and reliability issues, thereby making it unsuitable for space and planetary exploration applications. The proposed STTR research aims to develop a new type of MWIR photodetector with a significantly enhanced quantum efficiency of ~ 60% and photodetectivity of > 10^10 cm Hz^1/2/W. Successfully developing the proposed innovation is expected to provide an enabling technology for compact high performance MWIR detection and imaging systems suitable for xxxxxx space exploration and earth remote sensing applications.

Robotic Interface DogTags for Autonomous Habitat Outfitting and Logistics, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	"One of the key elements of xxxxxx future human exploration plans is the development of human-tended deep space habitats. These may serve as habitats during transfer from Earth to a destination (the xxxxxx, xxxxxx, etc), or serve as periodically-inhabited orbital bases. For all of these deep-space habitats, especially ones left in orbit around a destination planet or xxxxxx, astronaut time at the habitat will be both infrequent, and very valuable. As such it would be extremely desirable to develop ways to enable robots to outfit the habitat prior to human occupation, and to allow robots to perform maintenance and logistics tasks both when humans are present and when they are not. These robotic interaction aids ideally can serve three purposes: 1) helping robots determine their relative pose and position with respect to the target, and their relative location/pose inside or outside the habitat, 2) identifying what the objects are, especially if the objects are mobile like soft-goods bags, and 3) simplifying physical interactions with the object, including anchoring to and manipulating the object. To enable these types of robotic interactions, xxxxxx proposes the development of a lightweight, low-cost, passive \"DogTag\" robotic interface that can be attached to various habitat structures and objects. The DogTag interface includes: 1) a thin (<0.4mm) ferromagnetic material layer that allows robots with magnetic grippers to stick to the DogTag, 2) a printed on long-range optical fiducial on the DogTag face for allowing the robot to determine relative pose and position of the object even from across a large habitat, 3) an identification code and possibly RFID tag for identifying the object, also on the DogTag face, and 4) methods for attaching the DogTag to the desired object. During xxxxxx I, xxxxxx and team will define requirements, develop and test the optical fiducials and identification codes, and develop conceptual DogTag designs and prototypes, raising the xxxxxx from 2 to 3."	15871

Micromachined Sensors for Hypersonic Flows, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Interdisciplinary Consulting Corporation proposes a sensor that offers the unique capability to make wall shear stress measurement and pressure measurements for time resolved, unsteady hypersonic measurements in xxxxxx facilities.  An all sapphire optical-based sensor scheme will facilitate high bandwidth, high resolution, and robust sensors for both skin friction and pressure measurements in harsh hypersonic flow environment.  The proposed shear stress sensor possesses utilizes xxxxxx based technique for non intrusive remote data acquisition using sapphire fibres.  The pressure sensor utilizes an optic lever-based measurement scheme.  Both the shear and pressure sensor are co-located on a single die for localized surface stress measurement.  A robust and compact package with miniature interface electronics enables flush sensor mounting conformal with the surface.  The sensor development effort focuses on novel pico-second laser micromachining techniques for fabrication on sapphire with minimal heat damage to maintain original sensor material properties.  Furthermore, sapphire's high transparency (170 nm to 5.3 &#956;m wavelength range) along with the availability of sapphire optical fibers make possible the fabrication of optical sensors with the electronics located remotely from the sensor. Sapphire wafers are also readily available in numerous sizes and crystallographic orientations.  The sensor will exceed its predecessors in performance and will offer hypersonic surface stress measurement capabilities that are currently insufficient.	15874

Low-Power Wideband Digital Spectrometer for Planetary Science, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	The purpose of this project is to develop a wideband digital spectrometerto support space-born measurements of planetary atmospheric composition. The spectrometer is based on a superconducting digitizer and a digital autocorrelator. The digitizer will be able to handle the entire6 -18 GHz band by operating above the Nyquist frequency (target: 30 Gxxxxxxxxs). The superconducting circuits will be based on Niobium-based xxxxxx Single xxxxxx Quantum (RSFQ) technology. They will be implemented without substantially impacting the cryogenic sensor package. The data from the superconducting digitizer will be processed by a 128-lag autocorrelator. During the xxxxxx I performance period, we will determine whether the autocorrelator is best implemented using theRSFQ autocorrelator circuits we developed for the xxxxxxional xxxxxx Foundation, or the polyphase implementation we recently produced using fast FPGAs. The criteria for downselecting the best design will be the projected  Signal-to-Noise ratios and the relative added terms to the system noise temperature. Our choice of Niobium superconductor technology will enable one singletechnology to implement the xxxxxxHertz mixer, the digitizer, and the fast manipulation of digital data on a low-power low-temperature platform.	15885

Enabling Technology for Thermal Protection on HIAD and Other Hypersonic Missions, Phase II	2018-05-01	2018-07-19	Gas conduction and radiation are the two important heat transfer mechanisms in highly porous reusable thermal protection systems used for planetary entry of space vehicles.  The relative magnitude of the two varies depending on altitude, temperature and the planet.  Usually radiation is more significant at lower pressures and at higher temperatures.  Gas conduction is more dominant at higher pressures and lower temperatures.  In most planetary entries, both modes of heat transfer are significant.   Typical flexible or rigid refractory ceramic fiber Thermal Protection xxxxxx (TPS) such as xxxxxxanced Flexible Reusable xxxxxx Insulation (AFRSI) and xxxxxx tiles can take high temperatures, can reduce gas conduction at lower pressures, and scatter radiation at higher temperatures.   There is a need for more efficient TPS with lower mass, reduced thickness and significantly lower thermal conductivity to make inter planetary missions possible.  In order to achieve this goal, insulations need to be developed that can further reduce gas conduction and radiation heat transfer compared to standard refractory ceramic fiber insulations. The overall objective of the xxxxxx program is to migrate and optimize proven paper making concepts to fabricate robust, flexible and cost efficient, fiber reinforced aerogels, without sacrificing the thermal and mechanical qualities, in large sections suitable for application on High xxxxxx Vehicles (HSV's).  Further investigation in xxxxxx would focus on production methods and recipe optimization for this new class of thermal insulations.   Embedding materials with advantageous properties into fibrous mats allows tailoring the temperature and flexibility requirements to meet the needs of specific missions.	15889
Radio Frequency Micro Ion Thruster for Precision Propulsion, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx proposes to develop radio frequency discharge, gridded micro-ion thruster that produces sub-mN thrust precisely adjustable over a wide dynamic thrust range.  Such propulsion is needed to augment and overlap the present micro xxxxxx propulsion such as colloid thruster.  The RF was selected to eliminate the internal cathode of the DC discharge ion thrusters.  This cathode could be a life limiting component and consumes propellant.  Two types of neutralizers are candidates for the proposed thruster and include xxxxxx's carbon nanotube field emission cathode similar to that developed for the ST7 DRS mission and already demonstrated RF discharge cathode which consumes much less flow than comparable hollow cathode.  The performance of the proposed RF micro-ion thruster is expected to approach that of the xxxxxx JPL xxxxxx which represents the state of the art in small ion thrusters with DC discharge.  In xxxxxx the RF micro-ion thruster will be build and tested and second generation laboratory device will be designed.  MIT, our subcontractor, will initiate the development the RF thruster numerical model to support the experimental effort.In xxxxxx 2 the thruster system will be constructed and demonstrated including the optimized thruster, neutralizer, key parts of the PPU and the feed system.	15890

Distributed Impact Detection System, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	"Automated impact detection and characterization on manned spacecraft has been an elusive goal due to the transitory nature of the detectable high-frequency signals.  The proposed approach for this effort is to use large numbers of self-powered, miniaturized, \"stick on\" piezoelectric sensory nodes that are synchronized within a radio frequency network.  Each node will continuously monitor an accelerometer or acoustic emission sensor element for an impact event, such as the foam impact that caused the xxxxxx tragedy or an Mxxxxxx impact.  When a programmable threshold is exceeded, a low-latency signal acquisition circuit will capture the event as a digital waveform for post-processing and impact characterization.  In addition, autonomous collaboration and synchronization between nodes of the network will provide for accurate location determination through amplitude and time-of-arrival analysis.  The innovative signal conditioning circuit design is capable of operation in the micro-watt range on average while constantly maintaining the capability to process and acquire very high-frequency acoustic signals.  Such performance can provide operating lifetimes of 20+ years on a single AA battery, or unlimited operation from scavenged power sources such as solar or thermal gradients."	15892
Compact in situ Polyethylene Production from Carbon Dioxide, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx has redesigned the cathode of the commercially available PEM water electrolyzer such that it can support the reduction of carbon dioxide into ethylene and suppress the competing hydrogen reaction.  When coupled with an ethylene polymerization reactor to make polyethylene our technology could make plastics out of the xxxxxx xxxxxx atmosphere in a simple two-step process.  PEM water electrolyzers have already been proved space worthy and are commercially available at various scales.  xxxxxx polymerization is well understood.  Our innovation enables the creation of polyethylene from the most basic starting materials: xxxxxx, water and electricity.  During xxxxxx I, xxxxxx will show the feasibility of ethylene production in a single step by hitting key performance targets to optimize our existing prototype reactor.  This optimization will be done by creating and testing different ratios of the catalysts to the other material components of the reactor.  During xxxxxx, we will integrate our reactor design into commercially available PEM electrolyzers with a commercial partner and add a polymerization reactor to the system to produce polyethylene for additive manufacturing.	15893
Prediction and Control of the Vibroacoustic Environment During a Launch Sequence, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	The complexity of the current launch platforms makes their maintenance and operation very costly. In order to successfully design the next generation platforms, it is necessary to understand the complex, multi-disciplinary environments that exists during a launch sequence. The proposed research and development effort will use state of the art techniques in the various fields involved to compute the virboacoustic environment during launch. The physical insight gained from these models will help guide the design of a new cost-effective launch platform. In particular, the problem of unsteady turbulent flows will be addressed using a newly developed turbulence modeling approach known as partially averaged xxxxxx (or PANS). Using PANS nearfield results, the acoustic farfield will be obtained through the use of acoustic analogies. In addition, various passive and active control techniques will be assessed to effectively reduce noise levels in the vicinity of the launch platform.	15894

Interplanetary CubeSats: Opening the Solar System to a Broad Community at Lower Cost	2012-09-01	2018-07-19	Today, xxxxxxar xxxxxx exploration missions are the exclusive domain of space agencies and their scientists and engineers who can muster multi-hundred-million dollar budgets. While their accomplishments are broad, highly sophisticated and literally out of this world, the high cost limits our pace of important discoveries. Interplanetary xxxxxx offer an opportunity to conduct focused science investigations around the inner xxxxxxar xxxxxx at a cost ten times lower than missions mounted today. In much the same way that xxxxxx weighing a few pounds have dramatically increased low cost access to space experimentation in low Earth orbit, this study intends to focus development of six technologies in unison so as to enable dramatically lower cost exploration of the xxxxxxar xxxxxx and our Earth's more distant environs. Using the pressure of sunlight, a gravitationally defined xxxxxx, advanced electronics and instrumentation, and laser communications, may extend the turn-of-the-millennium CubeSat standard for nanosatellites to distances far beyond Earth's magnetic cocoon. xxxxxx in low Earth orbit have enabled dozens of universities to develop and place in orbit student-led, student-designed, student-built, and student-operated satellites investigating all manner of scientifically exciting phenomena, while giving graduates of these programs a competitive edge they bring to xxxxxxn technology and industry. Additionally, xxxxxx have enabled Government-sponsored space experimentation and technology development on an accelerated schedule for unprecedented low cost. If successful, this system study of the technologies to enable Interplanetary xxxxxx will open the door to a similar revolution in access to space and new discoveries beyond Earth.	15897

Evolving from xxxxxx-on-Flex to xxxxxx-IN-Flex where the active silicon chips are themselves mechanically flexible, this technology will enable countless space, mobile, sensing, and advanced architecture systems for xxxxxx.	15898
Miniaturized Low-Power Piezo Microvalve for NanoSat and CubeSat Propulsion, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	In space propulsion applications, an increasingly unmet need is compact, low-power, precision flow regulating valves.  Propulsion for increasingly small spacecraft is limited by the availability of such valves.  xxxxxxhough much work on miniaturizing valves has been performed using microfabrication approaches, few of these efforts have resulted in technologies suitable for propulsion.xxxxxx proposes a piezo-actuated microvalve suitable for continuous regulation of gas, resolved to flowrates of better than 10^-3 sccm, enabling precision control of cold gas thrusters, resistojets, and low-power ion and xxxxxx thrusters.  xxxxxx's fluid microvalve, developed for colloid thruster operation on xxxxxx ST7 project, has demonstrated resolving fluid flow to 2.5 picoliters/s over the 0-60 microliter/s regime for 1 atm source pressure (delta p); preliminary microvalve gas tests indicate the ability to resolve gas flows to 10^-2 sccm over the 0-.25 sccm regime for similar delta p.  The valve architecture, when used with smaller available orifice diameters, provides 1-2 orders of magnitude lower flowrates.The focus of the effort shall be improvement of several design aspects in xxxxxx's existing valve design, upgrading the design for high pressure gas service, and novel repackaging into a volume of approximately 4cm^3.	15899

An optical scanning subsystem for a UAS-enabled hyperspectral radiometer	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	Hyperspectral radiometers will be integrated with an optical scanning subsystem to measure remote sensing reflectance spectra over the ocean.&nbsp; The entire scanning radiometer system will be integrated into an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to allow for remote sensing and for support of real time validation opportunities. &nbsp;xxxxxx hyperspectral imagery will be telemetered to a data visualization application for monitoring the progress of UAS surveys. A hyperspectral visible radiometer instrument system has been developed for use on UAS platforms.&nbsp; It has been successfully flown on three previous UAS field campaigns, and recently integrated for flight on board MIZOPEX a fourth.&nbsp; In all of these experiments, the radiometer was configured in a fixed-look scan angle mode that allowed for observing along a single fixed track, and the science data were recorded internally on board the UAS and only made available upon the successful return of the UAS and its payload.&nbsp; The focus of this project is to expand upon the present UAS capability for observing hyperspectral reflectance spectra.&nbsp; By integrating a scanning subsystem and a remote telemetry capability, we will enable science investigator(s) to modify the scanning configuration in order to optimize the science data collection in a specific region in the cross-track domain.A hyperspectral radiometer instrumentation will be integrated into a scanning subsystem in order to allow the radiometer to scan across a range of angles as the UAV progresses along in its survey. &nbsp;The configuration will consist of a series of lower spectral resolution radiometers that will be set to cross-track scan angles, a higher spectral resolution radiometer with a cosine collector set to zenith for measuring the downward radiance spectra, and a second higher resolution radiometer mounted to a servo motor for scanning along a cross-track scan angle that can either be preset or controlled remotely. &nbsp;Real time spectral observations will be downscaled to send the spectra to a downlink computer in near real time.&nbsp; These observations would then be available for re-tasking the scanning component of the radiometer.The ability to collect reflectance spectra of the ocean surface in real time can help scientists optimize their data collection strategies.&nbsp; xxxxxximization of data collection has become a growing area of research, especially for scienctists who are faced with collecting science data in a regions that have small space and time scales of variability.&nbsp; This problem is also one of concern for UAS-enabled science instruments that would prefer to set their observational focus as a function of the observed spatial variability, allowing more observations to be collected along features of interest and less within areas that show little variability.&nbsp; Such observing strategies lend well to 2D spatial mapping algorithms such as optimal interpolation.The present radiometer instruments and software is easily portable to a system configured with multiple radiometers.&nbsp; The two major technical aspects of this project will be in regard to the control of the pointing system and with the real time data telemetry link.	15901
In-Process Monitoring of Additive Manufacturing, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The key innovation in this project is the implementation of an Imaging xxxxxx Transform xxxxxx (IFTS) for in situ metal additive manufacturing process monitoring. In this xxxxxx I STTR project, Mound xxxxxx & Photonics Center, a developer of laser based additive manufacturing processing, will collaborate with the Air Force Institute of xxxxxx, with expertise and innovative hardware for spectroscopy, to implement the IFTS in a Selective xxxxxx xxxxxxing (SLM) R&D test bed to demonstrate advanced strategies for process control and in situ quality assurance such as: (1) automatic detection of the molten area in various layers, (2) in situ release of stresses induced by temperature gradients, and (3) real-time control of alloy composition and minimization of contaminants.  These capabilities with facilitate the manufacture of parts with complex geometries with improved microstructures and properties.In xxxxxx I we intend to: (1) prove the utility of the IFTS for monitoring SLM processing of metals and alloys, (2) determine surface temperatures with a statistical accuracy of better than 4 oC, systematic accuracy of better than 10 oC and a dynamic range of up to 2000 oC, and provide rapid (1 kHz), automatic identification of the molten area, (3) track changes in chemical composition due to evaporation, oxidation, and melt expulsion, (4) reduce data  dimensionality and correlate these IFTS sensor features with manufacture quality metrics, and (5) design the concept for a xxxxxx prototype sensor suite that focuses on key aspects of the IFTS datascape to inexpensively emulate the IFTS.  In xxxxxx, a prototype optical sensor will be developed for process control  of metallic additive manufacture of lightweight, reliable, low cost structures.	15902
High-Speed, Low-Power ADC for Digital Beam Forming (DBF) Systems, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx Group will design a high-speed, low-power silicon germanium (SiGe)-based, analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to be a key element for digital beam forming (DBF) systems that are used in xxxxxx future radar missions. The ADC will employ a novel combination of time interleaving, high-speed bipolar technology and low-power techniques, such as the double-sampling technique, providing exceptional sampling speed of 500 xxxxxxS,12 bits of resolution and very low, 100mW power dissipation. Ordinarily, ADC design requires large trade-offs in speed, resolution, and power consumption. The significance of this innovation is that it simultaneously provides a high-speed, high-resolution, and low-power ADC that is well ahead of the state-of-the-art. These three characteristics are needed for DBF systems that contain large ADC arrays. The power consumption of existing ADC chips prohibits implementation of large DBF arrays in space. xxxxxx's innovative design leverages newer semiconductor process technologies that combine silicon and germanium into a compound semiconductor.	15903
High Temperature Acoustic Noise Reduction Materials, Phase I	2005-01-01	2018-07-19	The proposed innovation is to use combustion synthesis techniques to manufacture ceramic-based acoustic liners capable of withstanding temperatures up to 2500?C. Combustion synthesis or self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS) is a novel technique used by Guigne xxxxxx xxxxxxs xxxxxx. to produce many advanced high-temperature materials and composites. The materials have a ceramic matrix (alumina xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx-xxxxxx, xxxxxx, or xxxxxx-TiB2) and exhibit high porosity. These materials can also be fabricated with a functional gradient, i.e., with a change in chemistry and/or porosity within the same sample. When compared to traditional manufacturing techniques for high-temperature materials, combustion synthesis has the advantages of energy and time saving methods, high purity final product, simplicity of process and low cost. The target application for the porous ceramics is as high temperature acoustic liners for noise reduction in rocket and jet engines. The proposed work is xxxxxx I of the project.	15904
Micro-Slit Collimators for X-ray/Gamma-ray Imaging, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	Mikro xxxxxxs, xxxxxx. (MSI) will advance the state-of-the-art in high resolution, high-aspect-ratio x-ray/gamma-ray collimator fabrication into the micro-slit regime (slit pitch on the order of 10-20 microns) through the use of an innovative hybrid micro-machining technology.  To achieve high resolution imaging at hard x-ray and gamma-ray energies, grid-based optics are currently required.  Fine grids, having high-aspect-ratio (>50:1) and made from dense materials, are the enabling components for solar and astrophysical imaging with high angular resolution at x-ray and gamma-ray energies.  xxxxxxentation for these missions is severely constrained by size and mass considerations. Since the angular resolution scales with the grid-aperture to instrument-length ratio, the ability to produce grids with finer pitch has the direct result of higher angular resolution and/or overall reduction in instrument size and mass.	15905

High Performance Plasma Channel Insulators for High Power Hall Thrusters, Phase II	2017-01-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx missions for planetary exploration require high power, long-life xxxxxx thrusters. xxxxxxver, thruster power and lifetime are limited by the erosion of plasma channel walls.  Current plasma channel insulators, BN or Borosil, have the required low secondary electron emission (SEE) but are susceptible to xenon plasma erosion. xxxxxx has exceptionally high plasma erosion resistance but suffers from high SEE yield. xxxxxx can be a \"revolutionary\" replacement for BN channel insulator since it provides high plasma erosion resistance with structural robustness and high thermal conductivity if it's SEE yield can be reduced. In xxxxxx I program we demonstrated the SEE yield of xxxxxx can be reduced to the levels of state-of-the-art BN-based materials by microstructural engineering  without sacrificing  its thermal and mechanical properties for long-life plasma channel insulators in high power xxxxxx thrusters."	15907

Microplate Heat Exchanger, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	We propose a microplate heat exchanger for cryogenic cooling systems used for continuous flow distributed cooling systems, large focal plane arrays, multiple cooling locations, and very low vibration cooling systems. Any DC cryogenic flow system such as turbo xxxxxx, xxxxxx (JT), or remote cooling applications require very high effectiveness heat exchangers to reduce input power. The parasitic loads from heat exchangers are a significant fraction of the overall load, and high effectiveness heat exchangers lead directly to improved system efficiencies across a broad range of cryogenic applications.xxxxxxplate heat exchangers have a demonstrated effectiveness over 98% (Marquardt, xxxxxxcoolers 15). While performance is high, they will be difficult to use for larger cryogenic flow systems due to parasitic conduction losses inherent in the materials available for the manufacturing process. A material change will allow more compact heat exchangers with lower parasitic losses. Other limitations of the manufacturing process make yields low, and while it may be possible to push the effectiveness higher, it may be difficult to consistently produce high performing exchangers using the current approach.We propose a new bi-metal microplate heat exchanger which is unique in that it uses the manufacturing process to control critical heat exchanger dimensions that are inherently similar across all parts, allowing high effectiveness without the need for close inspection of every part and the low yield which results from hand inspection. We further include additional features within the flow channels that automatically balance the mass flows within the heat exchanger to push the effectiveness even higher. This is accomplished in the most compact cryogenic heat exchangers theoretically possible to build using parallel plate flow channels.	15914

A Novel Radiation Shielding Material, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	In order to safely explore space, humans must be protected from radiation.  There are 2 predominant sources of extraterrestrial ionizing radiation, namely, xxxxxx xxxxxxs (GCR) consisting primarily of nuclei of atoms (up to Fe) and xxxxxx (SEP), which includes mainly high-energy protons.  In addition, neutrons that are formed due to breakdown of the incoming radiation flux in the shielding material have to be accounted for.  An innovative, castable, boron coated, polyethylene epoxy is potentially a cost-effective lightweight radiation shielding material possessing structural as well as shielding properties.  During xxxxxx I, techniques will be evaluated for coating polyethylene particles with boron to prevent sedimentation of the higher density boron in the epoxy.  In addition, techniques will be developed to uniformly disperse these particles in an epoxy matrix.  Radiation simulations will also be performed.  From these simulations it will be determined what parameters, such as volume percent boron coated, polyethylene particles, are necessary for this material to provide optimal protection to humans and electronics in a deep space environment.  During xxxxxx, the fabrication techniques will be optimized.  xxxxxx will be produced for extensive mechanical properties testing as well as for radiation testing.	15916

This system can be used on xxxxxx, the xxxxxx, as well as xxxxxx (a Spider concept with self- anchoring approach was developed).We propose to focus this xxxxxx I on the two approaches of water extraction: xxxxxx and xxxxxx. At the end of the xxxxxx, we will trade all 3: xxxxxx, xxxxxx, MISME and select one for further development in xxxxxx 2.After the xxxxxx and the xxxxxx tests, a trade study will be conducted to compare xxxxxx vs xxxxxx vs MISME approaches. The trade study will include figure of merits (e.g. extraction efficiency etc), potential for scaling production up, easy of deploying on more than one planetary body, as well as mission implementation challenges and risks. During this time we will also work closely with our COTR to determine mission preferences. The end result will be selection of the best approach.During this trade study we will also consider different properties of planetary regoliths as well as environmental conditions that would affect excavation and processing (e.g. poorly sorted particle size distribution and agglutinates on the xxxxxx which make regolith very cohesive, perchlorates and clays on xxxxxx which make soil very sticky etc).	15918

Distributed Impact Detection System, Phase II	2007-12-01	2018-07-19	"Automated impact detection and characterization on manned spacecraft has been an elusive goal due to the transitory nature of the detectable high-frequency signals.  The proposed approach for this effort is to use large numbers of self-powered, miniaturized, \"stick on\" piezoelectric sensory nodes that are synchronized within a radio frequency network.  Each node will continuously monitor an accelerometer, acoustic emission sensor, or PZT element for an impact event, such as the foam impact that caused the xxxxxx tragedy or a micro-meteor impact.  When a programmable threshold is exceeded, a low-latency signal acquisition circuit will capture the event as a digital waveform for post-processing and impact characterization.  In addition, autonomous collaboration and synchronization between nodes of the network will provide for accurate location determination through amplitude and time-of-arrival analysis.  The innovative signal conditioning circuit design is capable of operation in the micro-watt range on average while constantly maintaining the capability to process and acquire ultrasonic acoustic signals.  Additionally, the system will provide a general purpose hardware platform on which integrated structural health monitoring algorithms and sensing techniques can be implemented.  Such performance can provide operating lifetimes of 10+ years on a single AA battery, or unlimited operation from scavenged power sources."	15920
Lander Technology: ALHAT capabilities including Navigation Doppler Lidar (NDL)	2020-09-01	2018-07-19	The CoOperative Blending of Autonomous xxxxxxding Technologies (COBALT)  instrument is a terrestrial test platform for development and  maturation of guidance, navigation and control (GN&amp;C) technologies  for precision landing.

These technologies together provide precise navigation know  ledge that is critical for a controlled and precise touchdown.	15921
Rad-hard Smallsat / CubeSat Avionics Board, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	VORAGO will design a rad-hard Smallsat / CubeSat xxxxxx single board that has the necessary robustness needed for long duration missions in harsh mission environments. The board will exceed processing performance of 100 DMIPS and will include a rad-hard MCU and an FPGA to implement mission specific processing functions. I2C, CAN, SPI, and xxxxxxWire busses will be supported on-board along with four 8-10bit SExxxxxxS interfaces. On-board memory will include 16 MB of EDAC protected RAM, 4 GB of non-volatile memory storage and 256 kB of non-volatile memory for boot software. The board will accept and digitize 16 thermistor inputs and 8 active analog inputs. A watchdog timer and external reset signal will be provided on the board. The board will be no bigger than 90mm x 90mm and will be specified to consume no more than 3W. The deliverables for the project will include board schematics, bill of materials and costing, industry-standard deliverables for fabrication of the board, assembly and testing. In addition, a thorough component analysis will be reported including power consumption characteristics (to demonstrate that 3W will not be exceeded) and radiation performance specifications to ensure that the board has been designed to meet the objective of long duration missions in radiation environments. A board-level FMEA will be supplied as part of the deliverable and QML design practices will be followed and documented. In addition, a detailed list of software and hardware development tools for programming and developing command and data handling software will be supplied.

The Design and Integration of a Distributed Fan Propulsion System within a Split-Wing, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	"A baseline propulsion system has been designed as a starting point in a previous xxxxxx effort for this project which consists of two turboshaft engines, a generator coupled directly (no gearbox) with each engine, and electric cables to motors that drive shrouded fans installed in or over the wing.  For this baseline, there are eight fans per wing, and the turboshaft engines use kerosene fuel as the energy source.  One major issue faced by this type of configuration is the propulsion integration of not only the structure with motors in a split wing, but also the aerodynamics of such a configuration.  In the previous study, high pressure recovery inlets, exhaust nozzle area control, thrust vectoring and variable pitch fans were considered, along with the initial layout of the entire structural integration.  The work proposed here aims to further address these concerns and outline a potential fan, inlet and nozzle design methodology for split-wing distributed propulsion.  This methodology can be turned into a design tool, for which the framework will be created as part of this study to be fully completed in a possible xxxxxx.  In addition, and most important to this topic, several aerodynamic aircraft concepts have also been looked at under currently supported work with xxxxxx Polytechnic State xxxxxxersity on their N+2 NRA contract to study future CESTOL aircraft and during internal study efforts at ESAero.  The work proposed here will complement much of that work by taking a better look at some novel integration arrangements in the configurations.  This will specifically address overall vehicle efficiency by looking at the aerodynamic concepts inherently designed into the aircraft.  This will be an important part of the study, as a properly integrated distributed propulsion system will offer the means to reduce \"specific\" fuel consumption, thereby increasing aircraft operating efficiencies to reduce overall mission fuel burn."	15923
Instrumented Suit Hard Upper Torso (HUT) for Ergonomic Assessment	2012-08-01	2018-07-19	It is well known that the EVA suit (EMU) has the potential to cause crew injury and decreased performance. xxxxxxing data on the suit interaction of the human within the suit are currently difficult to obtain, but are sorely needed to enable designers to make the necessary changes to current designs and optimize future designs. Quantifiable physical performance and human-suit interaction data are essential to understand/overcome the current limitations of the suit. A transparent hard upper torso (HUT) was built to be instrument-friendly, allowing ergonomists and designers to shed new insight into what is happening inside the HUT with quantifiable and relevant data.xxxxxxmembers undergo strenuous suited training for EVA missions. Frequent exposure to such activities can eventually lead to Cumulative Trauma Disorders/xxxxxx and reduced performance (results which are already well documented for the EVA suit). xxxxxxing data such as dynamic fit, mobility and human-suit contact measurements within the suit are currently difficult to obtain, but is sorely needed to enable designers to make the necessary changes to current designs and optimize future designs. xxxxxxical performance and human-suit interaction data are thus essential to shed new insight into what is happening inside the HUT.  Relevant and currently hard to obtain human interaction data inside the suit should enable xxxxxx to build a 21st century suit. A transparent EVA-type suit HUT with adjustable components was designed and manufactured. The transparent HUT can be attached to an adjustable-height stand, or worn directly on the body with a restraining harness to keep the transparent HUT's relative position the same as an actual HUT when worn. The transparent HUT was designed to weigh a mere fraction of the actual HUT and therefore facilitate functional testing.  A brief pilot study showed that the HUT did indeed fit the subject similarly to an actual EMU HUT, with restrictive internal volume and mobility, and that it greatly improved the ability to gather internal volumetric and interference data and allowed visual/video inspection of internal interfaces.	15924
Fusion of modeling and simulation credibility in multidisciplinary design, Phase I	2016-06-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx vehicle design and aircraft design are just two examples of systems that are of interest to xxxxxx, requiring interactions and exchange of information among multiple performance disciplines.  Since any computational optimization process relies on simulation models for identifying the impact of design changes in meeting performance expectations and improving metrics of goodness, it is essential that the uncertainty quantification of these models is captured by the optimization.  Fuzzy Logic (FL) provides a systematic approach for introducing linguistic articulation of mental perception into a mathematical framework.  In the proposed project the FL approach will be used for introducing in an automated multidisciplinary optimization process the human judgment and the expert opinion associated with the credibility of the modeling and simulations (as stated in the xxxxxx-STD-7009) which are utilized for making decisions.  The proposing firm has developed a Decision Support Toolkit (DS Toolkit) which can be used for multidisciplinary design and for balancing many multiple competing performance objectives.  The multidisciplinary analysis is done automatically due to specialized algorithms and capabilities which are embedded in the DS Toolkit; both discrete and continuous design variables can be defined.  The proposed research will develop the ability to consider the credibility of the models and of the simulations which are used for evaluating the performance requirements and the performance metrics during the analysis.  A Fuzzy Logic xxxxxx (FLS) capability will be developed for this purpose.  The membership functions in the FLS will be reflecting the credibility scores assigned by subject matter experts to each one of the eight credibility factors of a simulation.  The rule bank in the FLS will capture the expert opinion of the decision makers on how the credibility of the simulations will influences the decisions which are made by the optimization process.	15925
Titan Submarine: Exploring the Depths of Kraken	2015-06-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx is unique in the outer solar system in that it is the only one of the bodies outside the Earth with liquid lakes and seas on its surface. The xxxxxxian seas, however, are not composed of water, like Earth's seas, but are seas of liquid hydrocarbons. What lies beneath the surface of xxxxxx seas? We propose to develop a conceptual design of a submersible autonomous vehicle (submarine) to explore extraterrestrial seas. Specifically, to send a submarine to xxxxxx largest northern sea, xxxxxx. This craft will autonomously carry out detailed scientific investigations under the surface of xxxxxx, providing unprecedented knowledge of an extraterrestrial sea and expanding xxxxxx existing capabilities in planetary exploration to include in situ nautical operations.  Sprawling over some 1000 km, with depths estimated at 300 m, xxxxxx is comparable in size to xxxxxx and represents an opportunity for an unprecedented planetary exploration mission. This mission would be a logical follow-on to a xxxxxx surface mission such as TiME (xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx) or even a component of a flagship mission of multiple vehicles. The mission concept we propose to study will investigate a full spectrum of oceanographic phenomena: chemical composition of the liquid, surface and subsurface currents, mixing and layering in the \"water\" column, tides, wind and waves, bathymetry, and bottom features and composition. Measurements of all these aspects of xxxxxx hydrocarbon ocean environment can only be made through focused in situ exploration with a well-instrumented craft. This investigation represents a significant advancement in our understanding of the history and evolution of organic compounds in the solar system, and hence a critical step along the path to understanding the evolution of life here on Earth and potential life elsewhere in the galaxy.  While concepts of exploring extraterrestrial oceans, specifically xxxxxx, have been proposed in the past they have centered on simple suspended probes or 'diving bells' (xxxxxx, 2009, xxxxxx, 2010.) xxxxxx, or xxxxxx for short, will be a fully autonomous, highly capable science craft that will allow a complete exploration of what exists beneath the waves on another world. As such no one has yet envisioned what such a craft might look like, how it would operate or if it could be built; this is the conceptual mission design work we propose with xxxxxx. The xxxxxx addresses xxxxxx strategic goals 2, 3, and 6 by exploring the xxxxxx environ-ment which could hold clues to how earth and life formed, it will create new technologies in the form of a semi-autonomous planetary submersible which could be extended to other planetary oceans, and would capture the imaginations of educators and students by sharing with them exploration of a completely new environment on a foreign world. xxxxxx will also address the xxxxxx technology areas of xxxxxx xxxxxx and Energy xxxxxx, xxxxxx and Autonomous xxxxxxs, Communications and Navigation xxxxxxs, xxxxxx xxxxxxents and xxxxxxs, Materials, and Thermal Management xxxxxxs. By addressing the challenges of autonomous submersible exploration in a cold outer solar system environment, xxxxxx serves as a pathfinder for even more exotic future exploration of the subsurface water oceans of xxxxxx etc."	15926

In-Space Friction Stir Welding Machine, Phase I	2014-05-01	2018-07-19	Longhurst xxxxxxing, PLC, and xxxxxx xxxxxxersity propose an in-space friction stir welding (FSW) machine for joining complex structural aluminum components.  The proposed FSW machine is innovative because it can be deployed by 2 people and be used to weld complex surfaces that extend beyond linear welding applications.  The in-space FSW machine is a 3 axis system that can be mounted to work pieces of varying geometry, position, and orientation through the use of a high performance vacuum system or mechanical clamps.  The key enabler of the proposed FSW machine is a self adjusting and self aligning FSW (SAA-FSW) tool that eliminates the need for automated actuators.  In addition, a collection of force reduction techniques will be included as part of the system.  When combined together, it is theorized that the effect will be significant and will lead to the advancement of FSW by reducing structural rigidity requirements of FSW machines.Our work plan begins by determining the net effect of the combined force reduction techniques.  xxxxxxstantial effort is given to the development of a preliminary SAA-FSW tool which includes experimental welding.  Lastly, a preliminary set of engineering plans will be delivered based upon the results from the development of the SAA-FSW tool and force reduction techniques.	15932

Nanocomposite Scintillators for Gamma-ray Astronomy	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	With the Fermi mission well into its extended phase, the time is right to plan for the next generation gamma-ray project. No matter what form this mission might take, it will use scintillation-based materials as either primary or anticoincidence detectors.&nbsp; This project will develop and characterize nanocomposite scintillators for space-based applications, specifically tuned to medium energy (1 MeV - 100 MeV) gamma-ray astrophysics.&nbsp; xxxxxxcomposites are not only easier to manufacture and are thus cheaper than traditional scintillators while still providing similar or better performance, but they can be tuned to a specific application.&nbsp; We propose to develop and characterize nanocomposite scintillators for space-based applications, specifically tuned to medium energy (ME; 1 MeV &ndash; 100 MeV) gamma-ray astrophysics.&nbsp; At the end of the funded phase of this project we plan to have a working understanding of the manufacture and performance of several different types of nanocomposite materials.&nbsp; The end goal is not to have a working prototype of a detector but to be in a position where we can produce a detector tuned to a specific application based on future funding sources.&nbsp;	15934
Two-dimensional gas micro-well detector fabricated using advanced processing technology	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	The Three-Dimensional Track xxxxxx (3-DTI), developed at xxxxxx xxxxxx, is the enabling technology for future astrophysics missions. Using advanced technology, we propose to develop a process to fabricate a two-dimensional micro-well detector (MWD) readout for the 3-DTI.&nbsp; The MWD will provide tremendous improvements in 3-DTI reliability and performance.The gas filled 3-DTI Time Projection Chamber (TPC) achieves high particle track resolution using a negative ion (NI) drift technique to reduce diffusion of the ionization electrons along the track of a charged particle.&nbsp; This technique allows the track information to be preserved over long drift distances.&nbsp; The negative ion (NI) technique, however, presents a challenge to the TPC readout which typically utilizes a Townsend avalanche to amplify and detect the ionization charge. Using the NI technique, the ionization electron must be knocked free from the electronegative molecule before the Townsend avalanche can occur.&nbsp;This work utilizes advanced material processing techniques to fabricate small, high gain MWD structures.&nbsp; In addition, the small features reduces any loss of active area due to MWD tiling can be reduced to nearly zero and outgassing concern eliminated by using inorganic insulator and support materials.	15935
Variable Heat Rejection Loop Heat Pipe radiator, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	Thermal control systems are sized for the maximum heat load in the warmest continuous environment.  This design process results in a larger radiator surface area than is needed for portions of a mission where the heat load is lower or the environment is colder.  Now that xxxxxx is refocusing its human missions to the much colder areas of exploration beyond xxxxxx (LEO), the need for a variable heat rejection thermal control system increases.  This xxxxxx project by xxxxxx will develop a Variable Heat Rejection multi Loop Heat Pipe (VHR/mLHP) Radiator where the variable heat rejection feature will be provided by independently controlling the heat load for each LHP by heating and cooling the compensation chamber The proposed approach will use a series of individually controlled loop heat pipes (LHPs) receiving heat from a single phase pumped loop to perform the function of variable heat rejection while still closely controlling the loop setpoint temperature.  This technology development effort has three main objectives that build on mature LHP technology: optimization of the liquid/LHP heat exchanger, investigation of the use of heaters or thermoelectrics for temperature control and shutdown of the individual LHPs, and characterization of the system performance when multiple LHPs are assembled in series. The purpose of this program is to develop a holistic approach for a variable heat rejection system design consisting of multiple heat exchangers and multiple individually controlled LHPs which can achieve high turn down ratios for variable heat rejection while increasing the system reliability and reducing the system power and mass.  The proposed concept is flexible, as various configurations could be obtained to meet different mission parameters.  The main advantage of this technology development effort is that it leverages already proven technologies to integrate a novel system that can achieve robust variable heat rejection.	15936

Test Methods for the Determination of Anisotropic Compliances in 3D Woven Preforms for Ablative TPS, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx on the recent success of the xxxxxx Exploration Program and xxxxxx mission, xxxxxx has a desire to expand on the technology developed under each effort in order to increase future mission capabilities, namely an increase in payload capacity for entry to xxxxxx, xxxxxx and other xxxxxx-xxxxxxets. Such a goal requires an innovative solution to the vehicle's entry, decent and landing system (EDL). In order to address this goal,xxxxxx has recently invested in the development of low ballistic coefficient aeroshell technology concepts which typically consist of a flexible 3D woven carbon cloth that can be stowed during flight and deployed to serve as a semi-rigid aeroshell on atmospheric entry. The ability of individual groups of fibers within yarn bundles to undulate in multiple orientations relative to the major axis of the yarn bundle results in full anisotropy for the 3D woven preforms. In addition to adding more complexity to the accompanying analytical models, the testing of such materials is also complicated as compared to isotropic and transversely orthotropic materials.  Within the proposed xxxxxx I effort, Materials xxxxxxearch & Design will develop test methods for the materials characterization of a hybrid, woven 3D fabric for use in a flexible TPS application. The program willinvolve analytical, fabrication and experimental tasks to achieve the overall program goal of maturing technologies for advanced EDL systems. A few select tests will be performed at Southern xxxxxxearch Institute with strain data being captured for use in the anisotropic compliance matrix calculations. Finite element simulations, using a homogeneous representation of the anisotropic material, will be used to simulate each test and aide in the design of test specimens sufficient to generate measurable strain levels while simultaneously allowing the anisotropic material to deform naturally.	15938
Designer Fluid for use in a Single Loop Variable Heat Rejection Thermal Control System, Phase II	2018-06-01	2018-07-19	The efficient thermal control of vehicles is essential to the success of every single xxxxxx mission. All vehicles have very tight requirements for the thermal control systems while simultaneously placing incredibly stringent demands upon them. These demands are getting even more intense given the shift towards variable heat rejection, which is essential in missions reaching beyond the lower earth orbit. Specifically, the thermal control fluid must maintain excellent thermal properties for heat rejection under peak conditions while at the same time remain liquid at extremely low temperatures. Currently used fluids either do not meet the low temperature requirement (glycol/water mixture) or do not have thermal properties conducive to a compact, efficient system (Galden). xxxxxxstream has identified several promising next generation thermal fluids using computation chemical techniques. xxxxxxstream has already demonstrated in xxxxxx I that these fluids are superior to incumbent fluids. In xxxxxx, xxxxxxstream will perform more long term durability, compatibility and performance studies in a simulated test-loop representative of conditions encountered on xxxxxx spacecraft.	15939
Development of an End-to-End Active Debris Removal (ADR) Mission Strategic Plan	2012-02-01	2018-07-19	"The original proposal was to develop an ADR mission strategic plan. xxxxxxver, the task was picked up by the OCT. xxxxxxly the award was de-scoped to $30K to collect light curve data to characterize the tumble motion of potential ADR targets. This information is very critical to identify the technologies that will be needed during the proximity operations, including rendezvous and docking, for future ADR mission planning.Since the majority of the potential ADR targets are large (>meters) upper stages and payloads between 800 and 1100 km altitude, they are relatively bright, with visual magnitudes ranging from 5 to 7. Small telescopes are sufficient to collect their light curve data. xxxxxxver, due to the potential high tumble motion of the targets, a CCD camera with a frame rate up to 30/sec is needed. Identify an existing group with the necessary facility, equipment, experience, and capability for light curve observations of potential ADR targets in the low Earth orbit (LEO) region. Collect light curve data of at least 100 major ADR targets, including SL-8 Cosmos 3M second stages (2.4 m diameter by 6 m length; 1400 kg dry mass) and SL-16 Zenit second stages (4 m diameter by 12 m length; 8900 kg dry mass). xxxxxxess raw data, obtain light curves, and analyze the data. xxxxxx: A 4-month contract with the Air Force Academy was established in 2011. The Air Force Academy used one of their 16\" telescopes equipped with a fast Andor CCD camera for the observations. A total of 126 targets were observed during the 4-month period (ended in February 2012). About half of the targets had multiple passes. All raw data were processed, and summary spreadsheets for individual targets were prepared and delivered by the Air Force Academy. Two abstracts on the observations and the implications for the tumble motions of the ADR targets for the 2012 International xxxxxxical Congress were submitted and accepted for presentation."	15940
Developing quantum dot absorptive filter array based miniaturized spectrometer for space applications	2020-08-01	2018-07-19	The goal is to developing a miniaturized shortwave infrared (xxxxxx) spectrometer that is based on quantum dot absorptive filter array. The important features of the spectrometer are: small form-factor for portability, robustness due to absence of expensive and fragile dispersive optics, and quick acquisition due to the multiplexed filter array from which any arbitrary spectrum can be detected without scanning and be deconvoluted using a sophisticated algorithm. Different batches of quantum dots will be used as a unique filter and deposited on a solid substrate as an array. The filtered spectrum is recorded by the xxxxxx camera as an intensity profile and translated into a meaningful spectrum via reconstruction algorithm. The miniaturized quantum dot spectrometer can be used in environments where the form-factor of the spectrometer and fast acquisition capability is crucial, such as space applications.	15941

The study would produce an Ice Dome design concept and an Ice Dome Concept of Operations. The study would identify the primary technical risks, identify technology readiness and identify the external skillsets needed to build a subscale demonstrator for deployment studies.

Lunar Regolith Stabilization for Excavation, Phase II	2011-03-01	2018-07-19	During lunar exploration, regolith is both the major available resource and a substantial obstacle in establishing a long-term presence.  The fine surface dust is highly abrasive and can both be a health hazard for the crew and the main contributor to equipment failure.  xxxxxx is also the only material readily available to build protective shelters for the crew to prevent exposure to lethal doses of high-energy particles during solar eruption events.  To achieve the needed cover, methods have to be developed to convert regolith into a stable building material with minimal need for terrestrial supplies.  The technology should also be applicable to stabilize regolith in place, for example on excavated slopes or around air locks and landing fields where dust is disturbed by gas flows.In the xxxxxx I program, Adherent Technologies, xxxxxx. has developed the needed chemical formulations and application technologies to achieve both objectives.  xxxxxx can be formed into solid building material using only 5% earth-supplied binder, and the same binder can be used to stabilize loose regolith in the vacuum of space.  The proposed xxxxxx program will optimize the formulations and techniques developed previously and will design and build prototype applicators, both for spraying thin layers and for automated brick fabrication.  xxxxxx in a vacuum environment will demonstrate the capabilities and design concepts for deployable, weight optimized application systems will be included.	15944

Three sets of observations were acquired on 18-19 xxxxxxh, 28-29 May, and 4-5 xxxxxxe 2008 to characterize Earth as an analog for extrasolar planets. Each observing period lasted approximately 24 hours. HRIV images were acquired once per hour with the filters centered on 350, 750 and 950 nm, whereas the 450-, 550-, 650-, and 850-nm data were taken every 15 minutes. During the observing period in May, the xxxxxx transited across Earth as seen from the spacecraft. Additional Earth observations are planned for the mission, and these data will be added to a future version of this data set.	15945
In-Situ Sensing of Additive Manufacturing Process for safety-Critical Aerospace Applications, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx of fabricated components is an important subject in AM research. Adequate quality inspection of finished parts is challenging and non-destructive-techniques are often difficult to realize. The development of an online in-situ sensing is vital for component qualification and certification. The proposed project will support the goals of ICME through the development of an in situ monitoring system for AM. The system will enable the operator to monitor quality of an AM job online and assess quality of the finished part. The system consists of two major developments in hardware and software. The first development is the design of a complete sensor setup. xxxxxxs ensure a high-quality measurement of melt pool and as-spread/as-processed layer surfaces.  Open-source control software will transfer sensing-data at high sample rates sufficient for process monitoring. The second development is the data analysis system to translate and visualize measured sensor values in the format of interpretable process quality images. The visualization is accomplished by a mapping algorithm, which transfers measurements from a time-domain into a position-domain representation.

CNT-Based Smart Electrostatic Filters for Capturing Nanoparticulate Lunar Regolith, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	The abrasive, reactive, and ubiquitous nature of lunar regolith created significant and serious problems during the xxxxxx moon missions.  In this xxxxxx I, xxxxxx, in collaboration with Dr. xxxxxx of the xxxxxxersities xxxxxxearch Association, propose to develop next generation smart filters using novel carbon nanotube (CNT)-based structures in electrostatic devices.  Since CNTs have extremely high surface area, can function without the mass transfer limitations of traditional filtrations systems, and they can be charged to emit very high charge densities, they constitute an ideal material for integration into spacecraft air handling systems as electrostatic filtration components.  The overall goal of this program is to build upon the unique structural and electronic nature of carbon nanotubes to create novel smart filters.  By synthesizing the CNTs in situ on solid mesh supports and integrating them into a novel electrostatic particle collection unit, we aim to create novel filtration media capable of removing airborne lunar regolith from spacecraft airlock and cabin atmospheres.	15947

X-ray Computed Tomography Image Quality Indicator (IQI) Development	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	xxxxxx one of the program is to identify suitable x-ray xxxxxx (CT) Image Quality Indicator (IQI) design(s) that can be used to adequately capture CT system performance. Since CT system performance quantification is considerably more complicated than 2D radiography, the approach to develop performance standards will be focused within a subset of materials such as aluminum, stainless steel, titanium, and/or polymers. These IQIs could include cylindrical or conical gauges containing various sizes of holes for assessment of contrast sensitivity, or implanted features for assessing resolution. We propose to use radial-symmetric objects for these standards so that the geometry of the part does not add additional layers of complexity to an already complex parameter space. xxxxxxary IQI devices for 2D radiography are typically flat, and since the CT system implements geometric reconstruction using up to 360 degrees of incident angles, flat objects offer an unrealistic basis for a standard (unless the inspected part is of similar geometry). While some CT IQIs are commercially available, none are widely or universally accepted as standard. Most CT IQIs are phantoms intended for medical inspection purposes or follow ASTM E1695, which dictates that resolution be based on the modulation transfer function calculated across the exterior edge of a round coupon. While this may be sufficient for an order of magnitude assessment, the image sharpness of the exterior edge is not representative of interior boundaries and only serves as an indirect measure. We aim to develop IQIs more consistent with xxxxxx-related materials and using internal features/defects more representative of actual inspections.xxxxxx two of the program will focus on the quantification of the GSFC CT system using the produced CT performance standards. This will be followed by round-robin testing of the CT systems across the agency.&nbsp; The IQIs will be used to assess CT detectability limits, contrast sensitivity, and resolution.&nbsp; If additive manufacturing (AM) is utilized to generate the IQIs, a dual purpose, or secondary benefit to these IQIs is that the CT system may be used to ascertain AM material build defects and limitations.	15951
Intelliviz - An Intelligent Telemetry Data Visualization Assistant, Phase II	2011-08-01	2018-07-19	Future space programs will require extensive monitoring of complex, highly instrumented systems such as the xxxxxxn spacecraft and lunar/xxxxxx habitats. To handle tasks and situations that cannot be fully delegated to automation software, future flight controllers and crew must be able to monitor, review and interpret voluminous and complex telemetry data quickly to maintain necessary levels of situations awareness and make critical decisions rapidly and accurately.We propose to develop Intelliviz, an intelligent telemetry data visualization assistant for xxxxxx.  This software system will create data visualizations automatically to reduce the effort and difficulty of specifying and constructing effective telemetry data visualizations. Intelliviz will determine the user's data analysis goals by enabling users to express their data analysis goals directly and by posing system diagnosis or system management questions or problems from which analysis goals can be inferred. Intelliviz will then generate appropriate displays that support the user's data analysis goals by retrieving the relevant telemetry and systems data, selecting appropriate data display methods, and instantiating and configuring those displays.During the prior xxxxxx xxxxxx project, we reviewed research literature describing prior work in automated visualization design, reviewed related xxxxxx R&D programs, specified scenarios and test cases, identified promising early applications for Intelliviz, refined our requirements and design, implemented a software prototype that demonstrates Intelliviz capabilities, and developed a plan to create an operational prototype during xxxxxx 2.   During the phase 2 project proposed in this document, we will develop a technology readiness level 6 operational prototype of Intelliviz to demonstrate its feasibility, utility, and usability by a xxxxxx-relevant user community and task area.	15952

Numerical Algorithms for Steady and Unsteady Multi-Disciplinary Simulation of Flight Vehicles, Phase I	2005-01-01	2018-07-19	A new multidisciplinary software environment ('MUSE') will be developed for the simulation of flight vehicles, drawing on the results of recent research on very fast algorithms, performed at Stanford xxxxxxersity under Professor xxxxxx's guidance.  This new technology will be merged with Intelligent xxxxxx' finite element methology implemented in the product FASTPLANE.  This code, which uses multigrid acceleration techniques and is fully parallelized, can already perform^Msteady-state simulations of complete aircraft in less than 5 minutes on a 16 processor Beowulf cluster. The synergy resulting from the technology transfer will lead to a new level of capability for the simulation of both steady and unsteady flows, thus providing the platform needed to couple additional disciplines into an advanced multidisciplinary tool for aero-structural and thermal analysis.  It can also provide the platform for a new generation of design-optimization software using the adjoint methodology developed by xxxxxx and his collaborators during the last decade.  Moreover, with further advances in the performance of computer hardware that can be anticipated, real time simulation of flight vehicles should in the future be feasible with this new software. This would provide a powerful new tool to support flight-testing.	15954

A Comprehensive CFD Tool for Aerothermal Environment Around Space Vehicles, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	The goal of this xxxxxx project is to develop an innovative, high fidelity computational tool for accurate prediction of aerothermal environment around space vehicles. This tool will be based on the Unified Flow xxxxxxver (UFS) developed at CFDRC for hybrid simulations of rarefied, transitional and continuum flows. In this project, UFS will be enhanced to include: Boltzmann/continuum solvers for vibrationally excited molecules, advanced non-equilibrium chemistry coupled to non-gray radiative transport with real gas effects, and charged particle transport and chemistry. The unique strengths of our proposal are: (i) smart software with self-aware physics and adaptive numerics for hypersonic flows with non-equilibrium chemistry, (ii) direct Boltzmann solvers for charged and neutral particles in rarefied regimes, and (iii) a high-fidelity multi-scale radiation transport model that can handle orders of magnitude variation in the medium optical thickness. xxxxxx will include evaluation of physical models, initial implementation and demonstration of new capabilities. In xxxxxx 2, these capabilities will be fully developed, validated for selected benchmark problems, and applied to practical cases relevant to xxxxxx. The proposed tool will significantly upgrade the modeling fidelity of high-speed flows of molecular gases, and enable computational investigation of innovative hypersonic flow and plasma technologies.	15956
Reconfigurable Power-Aware EVA Radio, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxanced xxxxxx Activity (EVA) radio system is a pivotal technology for the successful support of xxxxxx  beyond 2020 and future human space exploration missions. It facilitates surface operations, enables crew mobility, and supports point to multi-point communications across rovers, xxxxxx, habitat, and other astronauts. Driven by Communications, Command, Control, and Information interoperability, tight power budgets, and extreme miniaturization, this mobile radio platform must be power efficient and highly adaptive. Intelligent Automation, xxxxxx. (IAI) and its sub-contractor, xxxxxx xxxxxxersity, propose to develop a power-efficient, miniaturized, reconfigurable EVA radio system using state-of-the-art RF micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and software defined radio (SDR) technologies; and middleware with power aware algorithms. xxxxxx FPGA devices are bridging the gap between high speed digital design and digital signal processor (DSP) implementation. The SDR-based architecture allows the radio to support multiple bandwidth, waveforms and energy profiles; even those developed after the mission began, via cognitive middleware. Therefore, it can lower the mission cost by upgrading the EVA radios when needed. The MEMS tunable filters proposed are based on miniaturized evanescent-mode cavities, which are 95% smaller than conventional cavities and are capable of providing very high Q and excellent tuning range.	15957
New Wireless Sensors for Diagnostics Under Harsh Environments, Phase II	2015-04-01	2018-07-19	High-temperature passive wireless surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors are highly desirable for improving safety and efficiency in aviation and space vehicles. This proposal addresses the growth and processing of a new class of high temperature material into acceptable SAW wafers, the production of SAW temperature sensors, and the integration of the SAW and thin film antenna (SAWtenna).  The project will provide a new, unique material grown in the US (no other US manufacturer is known, produce high temperature, radiation hard, solid state, passive wireless sensors for use in harsh environments. In this project, we will:1) xxxxxx a crystal material for SAW wafers suitable for high-temperature SAW fabrication.2) Design orthogonally frequency coded OFC (up to 1000 degrees C) SAW temperature sensors .3) xxxxxxte the SAW and antenna onto the wafer such that there are no external connections.    In xxxxxx I the capability for the production of LGT crystals was established and 2in diameter boules were grown. The crystals were processed into SAW wafers and confirmed to be of excellent quality, as evidenced from SAW parameters extraction.  A thin film process using simple metallization demonstrated extended device operation at 700 oC and short-term operation at 800 oC. xxxxxx I demonstrated the feasibility of high-temperature SAW devices, and a clear path in the xxxxxx effort for 1000 oC device operation. During xxxxxx, we will explore variations of the metallization and encapsulation, which will extend device life.  SAW OFC high temperature sensors, operating in the 915 ISM band, will operate simultaneously over temperature and will be delivered to xxxxxx.  xxxxxx will develop a fully integrated sensor antenna and upscale the crystal growth for 3-4in SAW wafers. Probability for xxxxxx commercialization of both the wireless SAW sensors and SAW wafers is very high.	15958
Quantum Networking and Sensing using a Diamond Nanophotonic Circuit	2020-08-01	2018-07-19	Quantum mechanics offers new ways to compute, communicate, and measure that are inherently more powerful than classical physics would allow. Of particular interest is the notion of a quantum network, where stationary and flying quantum bits (qubits) are transferred between remote nodes. Two strange quantum mechanical phenomena superposition and entanglement  allow such a quantum network to be used for feats impossible in a classical network. For example, a network of satellites with entangled qubit nodes would allow for perfectly secure communications, as well as more powerful distributed computing. Connecting a rover to the network would allow it to perform an ultraprecise quantum mechanical measurement by entangling one or more probe qubits to a sample, and then teleporting these qubits through the network for processing.The first links of such quantum networks have been demonstrated using xxxxxx-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. These NV centers are atomic defects in the diamond crystal that are both highly stable on a quantum mechanical level and easy to interact with optically, making them ideal for use in a network of qubits. The advantage of using this system over other candidates like cold atoms or trapped ions is that it can be operated over a wide range of temperatures and in a variety of atmospheric conditions, giving it great potential for use in space-based devices. xxxxxxver, current quantum networking schemes using NVs are limited by photon losses, restricting the efficiency - and thus scalability - of these systems. My research seeks to overcome this obstacle and develop a many-NV quantum node integrated onto a photonic circuit chip.To do so, I will integrate NV centers with optical nanocavities; through an effect called Purcell enhancement, these structures should increase the rate at which individual NVs emit photons that are coherent, that is, photons that maintain their quantum properties. xxxxxxreasing the number of coherent photons emitted by an NV will increase the rate at which it can be entangled with other NVs and thus used for quantum networking. I will also need to improve the efficiency with this increased emission can be collected from the NVs. Doing so will require incorporating novel structures like optical waveguides and tapers in with the diamond cavity. These techniques will allow me to efficiently route and collect the photons emitted from single NVs and use them for entanglement with other NV centers. Once I have accomplished this, the last stage will be to place everything on a single chip. xxxxxxting photonic circuits onto this chip will connect these many qubits and form a sort of quantum processor that can serve as a sensing device or a node in a quantum network.The properties of quantum mechanics would allow this node to communicate securely with other network points, or to perform distributed computations along with other devices in the same network. Quantum technologies for precision measurements already form the basis for the world's most accurate clocks and sensors, and a tailoring of this quantum node into a self-contained processor would allow for the creation of a light-weight quantum metrology device. For example, incorporating these chips into satellites would enable precision time-keeping in turn improving position, navigation, and timing for terrestrial and space applications. These new abilities will extend mankind's ability to learn and explore, both at the level of fundamental physics and on the scale of probing planets, moons, comets, and ultimately deeper space.	15959
High-repetition-rate Interferometric Rayleigh Scattering for Velocity, Density, and Temperature Measurements for Ground Test Facilities, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxsonic, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic ground test facilities are used extensively to evaluate forces and moments as well as surface measurements on test articles required to validate computational tools used to extrapolate wind tunnel data to realistic flight conditions and hardware. The development of fast and noninvasive instrumentation and measurement capabilities that can readily be integrated into the extreme environments is one of several major technological challenges associated with the design, building, and operation of these complex test environments.  xxxxxxly mapping velocity flow fields-undoubtedly one of the most critical parameters-remains a significant challenge.  In addition, spatially and temporally resolved measurements of other flow parameters such as density, pressure, and temperature are of paramount importance. This proposal offers an integrated package of truly cutting-edge, multidimensional, seedless velocimetry and multi-flow-parameter diagnostics for wind tunnels and ground test facilities.  The concepts and ideas proposed are ranging from proof-of-principles demonstration of novel methodologies using 10-100 kHz-rate nanosecond (10-100 nsec) duration burst-mode laser sources for measurements in realistic tunnel conditions. The proposed high-repetition-rate xxxxxx scattering which is suitable for any wind tunnel testing involving various gases is a state-of-the-art technique for analysis of unsteady and turbulent flows.	15960

Three Dimensional Volumetric Terahertz Scanning for Aerospace Non Destructive Evaluation, Phase II	2007-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx and the aerospace industry are beginning to utilize terahertz (THz) reflection imaging (for example, examining the space shuttle external tank sprayed on foam insulation for voids and disbonds). THz non destructive evaluation (NDE) imaging is widely applicable to composite resin, ceramic, plastic, natural, and other non-metallic materials. Current commercial equipment is capable of 2D raster scanning, collecting  THz waveforms from a very narrow depth range.  THz NDE technology can be more fully exploited if high speed 3D THz imaging is realized.  xxxxxx work will enable objects many inches thick to be imaged in 3D an order of magnitude faster than current 2D imaging configurations. We will develop and demonstrate the following innovative imaging methodologies for high speed, high sensitivity 3D NDE imaging:  1) xxxxxx 3-dimensional THz Synthetic Aperture xxxxxx (xxxxxx) and  Background-free THz  xxxxxx (rapid imaging);  2)Travel-time 3D  Reflection THz tomography (high resolution 3D structure); and 3) Interferometric THz time-of-flight bulk imaging (greater sensitivity to small voids and disbonds).   We will enhance our xxxxxx I tomographic testbed, construct an improved high resolution co-linear reflection transceiver, modify the transceiver for interferometry, and deliver a software suite of imaging algorithms for the T-xxxxxx 2000 THz NDE  platform.	15963
High Performance Simulation Tool for Multiphysics Propulsion Using Fidelity-Adaptive Combustion Modeling, Phase I	2018-06-01	2018-07-19	The innovation proposed here is a fidelity-adaptive combustion model (FAM) implemented into the xxxxxx CFD code for use at xxxxxx for simulation of rocket combustion. This work will result in a high-fidelity, high-performance multiphysics simulation capability to enhance xxxxxx current simulation capability of unsteady turbulent reacting flows involving cryogenic propellants.  This  novel FAM model utilizes a combustion submodel assignment, combining flamelet-based combustion models (such as inert-mixing models, equilibrium chemistry, diffusion-flame Flamelet/xxxxxx Variable (FPV) or premixed-flame models) for the computationally efficient characterization of quasi one-dimensional, steady, and equilibrated combustion regimes, with combustion models of higher physical fidelity (such as thickened flame models, reduced/lumped chemistry models) for accurate representation of topologically complex combustion regions (associated with flame-anchoring, autoignition, flame-liftoff, thermoacoustic coupling, and non-equilibrium combustion processes) that are not adequately represented by the current flamelet model in xxxxxx. In FAM, the selection of a combustion submodel from a set of models available to a CFD-combustion solver is based on user-specific information about quantities of interest and a local error control. With this information, FAM performs an identification procedure for an optimal combustion submodel assignment from the available combustion models that. This simulation capability will have direct impact on xxxxxx ability to assess combustion instability of rocket engines.	15964
Multi-Specimen Variable-G Facility for Life and Microgravity Sciences Research, Phase II	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx-specimen Variable-G Facility (MVF) is a single locker sized centrifuge facility for life and microgravity sciences research on xxxxxx.   The MVF is a rear breather EXPRESS xxxxxx payload that leverages many of the existing subsystems of flight proven (xxxxxx) Avian xxxxxxment Facility (ADF) thereby reducing costs and time to flight for new scientific capability. Two centrifuge rotor platforms are capable of applying 0&#150;2 g's to the modular specimen containers which can be modified to accommodate a wide variety of experiment samples.  Curved cell culture specimen containers are designed to maintain a constant radius (within ? 1 mm) without inertial-gradient shearing or significant xxxxxx acceleration.  Each rotor can accommodate 10 generic modular experiment specimen holders which can be accessed in real-time on-orbit any time during an experiment.  The centrifuge platforms include an active balancing system to ensure balanced rotation when the experiment sample modules contain slightly variable mass.  The MVF will control g-levels, temperature, humidity, ethylene, xxxxxx and other gases, and provides video observation capability with its removable modular subsystem allowing on-orbit cleaning and/or replacement.  The potential uses of the MVF are numerous, such as cell culture, aquatics, plants, algae, and invertebrate organisms. The modular multi-specimen holder can be utilized as a prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell culture vessel. It can be used to contain aquatic organisms such as xxxxxx fish, xxxxxx, tadpoles, and even developing amphibian eggs. Seedlings, small adult plants (Arabadopsis), and even fern spores could be located within the specimen holder. Other possibilities include xxxxxx (Chara) and fungi (S. cerevisiae).

A Computational Tool for High Advance Ratio Configurations, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxer vertical lift configurations consider speed as an important design parameter with forward speeds upwards of 230 Knots, which is well above the acceptable incompressible flow regime. In such high speed vertical lift configurations, even though the aircraft may be cruising at compressible xxxxxx numbers, incompressible flow pockets can occur in the wake of the fuselage. Hence, in contrast to most helicopters currently in use, these configurations need to be analyzed across a wide range of speed regimes including incompressible, compressible and mixed regimes.The present proposal offers to extend the design tool ``xxxxxx'' to viscous all-speeds with mixed incompressible and compressible regions. In general, the algorithms used in CFD are designed for incompressible flow or compressible flow, depending upon the primary usage. xxxxxx, being an xxxxxxted Design Environment (IDE) for rotors, can be developed to seamlessly work in both regimes without additional input besides the operating speed from the design community. Additionally, this proposal offers to extend xxxxxx to include grid generation with bodies in relative motion, such as tilting nacelles and wing tips, which happens in transitioning flight. The proposed extension of xxxxxx for all-speed regimes and flows with mixedregimes, if proven successful, will offer the vertical flight scientific community a moderate fidelity, robust and efficient design tool. With the added potential to simulate relative motion of components, the tool will provide an analysis capability for all operational regimes: hover, conversion and cruise.	15966

LiPo batteries and radio communications will enable untethered experiments. Initial autonomy will require error detection, this can be achieved through current sensing of motors and controls algorithms for error correction.

VG2 URA LECP RESAMPLED RDR STEPPING SECTOR 15MIN V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	This data set consists of resampled data from the Low Energy Charged xxxxxx (LECP) experiment on Voyager 2 while the spacecraft was in the vicinity of xxxxxx. This instrument measures the intensities of in-situ charged particles (>26 keV electrons and >30 keV ions) with various levels of discrimination based on energy, mass species, and angular arrival direction. A subset of almost 100 LECP channels are included with this data set. The LECP data are globally calibrated to the extent possible (see below) and they are time averaged to about 15 minute time intervals with the exact beginning and ending times for those intervals matching the LECP instrumental cycle periods (the angular scanning periods). The LECP instrument has a rotating head for obtaining angular anisotropy measurements of the medium energy charged particles that it measures. The cycle time for the rotation if variable, but during encounters it is always faster than 15 minutes. Thus, the full angular anisotropy information is preserved with this data. The data is in the form of 'Rate' data which has not been converted to the usual physical units. The reason is that such a conversion would depend on uncertain determinations such as the mass species of the particles and the level of background. Both mass species and background are generally determined from context during the study of particular regions. To convert 'Rate' to 'Intensity' for a particular channel one performs the following tasks: 1) Decide on the level of background contamination and subtract that off the given rate level. Background is to be determined from context and from making use of sector 8 rates (sector 8 has a 2 mm Al shield covering it). 2) Divide the background corrected rate by the channel geometric factor and by the energy bandpass of the channel. The geometric factor is found in entry 'CHANNEL_GEOMETRIC_xxxxxxxxxxOR' as associated with each channel 'CHANNEL_ID'. To determine the energy bandpass, one must judge the mass species of the of the detected particles (for ions but not for electrons). The energy band passes are given in entries 'xxxxxx' and 'MAXIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' in table 'FPLECPENERGY', and are given in the form 'Energy/Nucleon'. For channels that begin their names with the designations 'CH' these bandpasses can be used on mass species that are accepted into that channel (see entries 'xxxxxx' and 'MAXIMUM_INSTRUMENT_ PARAMETER' in table 'xxxxxx', which give the minimum and maximum 'Z' value accepted -- these entries are blank for electron channels). For other channels the given bandpass refers only to the lowest 'Z' value accepted. The bandpasses for other 'Z' values are not all known, but some are given in the literature (e.g. xxxxxx, 1979). The final product of these instructions will be the particle intensity with the units: counts/(cm**2.str.sec.keV). Some channels are subject to serious contaminations, and many of these contaminations cannot be removed except with a region-by-region analysis, which has not been done for this data. thus, to use this data it is absolutely vital that the contamination types ('CONTAMIxxxxxxION_ID' , 'CONTAMIxxxxxxION_DESC') and the levels of contamination ('DATA_QUALITY_ID' corresponding to the definitions 'DATA_QUALITY_DESC') be carefully examined for all regions of study. A dead time correction procedure has been applied in an attempt to correct the linear effects of detector overdrive (pulse-pileup). This procedure does not fix severely overdriven detectors. A procedure is available for correcting Voyager 2 LECP electron contamination of low energy ion channels, but its effectiveness has been evaluated only for the xxxxxx data set. Thus, corrections have been applied only to the xxxxxx data set. Also included with this data are one standard deviation statistical uncertainties for the directional data (sectors 1 through 8) expressed as a percent. Unknown values are generally coded as such, however in some instances the value will read 'ZERO' when its status is unknown.	15970
Self-Calibrating Greenhouse Gas Balloon-Borne Sensor, Phase II	2012-05-01	2018-07-19	Understanding the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases has been recognized as critical to predicting climate change and global warming.  A variety of research studies funded by DOE, NSF, xxxxxx and NOAA to measure the fluxes and fluctuations of xxxxxx profiles throughout the troposphere and lower stratosphere have provided a great deal of useful information, but the instrumentation used has been restricted to airplane or large stratospheric-type balloon gondola platforms where a few measurements are very expensive.  We propose a new approach where low cost, extensive measurement campaigns can be made using standard meteorological balloons.In this xxxxxx program, Southwest xxxxxxs is developing a lightweight, inexpensive greenhouse gas sensor suitable for balloon sonde measurements, Using a novel measurement technique, this sensor will provide dry air mixing ratios of xxxxxx without the need for concurrent measurements of temperature, pressure or moisture.

Large-Area, Multi-Junction, Epitaxial Lift-Off Solar Cells with Backside Contacts, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	In this xxxxxx I program we propose to develop an innovative fabrication process to introduce backside contacts to xxxxxxLink Devices' large-area, multi-junction epitaxial lift-off (ELO) solar cells. This will enable a new solar cell technology with potential benefits for future xxxxxx solar electric propulsion (SEP) programs using very large solar cell arrays. Backside contacts are used in the highest efficiency silicon solar cells manufactured by xxxxxxxxxxxx (>24% efficiency in production) but have never been successfully applied commercially to multi-junction solar cells. Benefits for large-area space solar cell include: higher device efficiency by reducing topside grid shadow and resistive losses, new approaches for panel assembly by placing contacts on backside of solar cell, and reduced arcing in high-voltage arrays by eliminating topside interconnects. The proposed technology builds on xxxxxxLink Devices' low-cost, lightweight ELO solar cell technology and previous experience with backside contact solar cells for CPV applications.	15972
Physics-Based Aeroanalysis Methods for Open Rotor Conceptual Design, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	Operating costs and fossil fuel consumption of civil transports can be reduced through use of efficient counter rotating open rotor (CROR) propulsion systems, thereby addressing both key industry needs and long-term xxxxxx technical goals.  To develop such next-generation systems, multiple design variables must be assessed and optimized efficiently within a conceptual design software environment.   A blend of physics-based, low- and mid-fidelity tools featuring rapid turnaround time and ease of setup can provide this capability; implementation represents a serious technical challenge, though, and there is a high premium on developing tools that are both sufficiently accurate to capture current technology performance metrics while permitting the rapid re-calculations necessary for design trades.  The proposed approach centers on a blend of enhanced features and novel departures for two complementary aeroanalysis methods: an evolved version of an established subsonic lifting surface free wake mdoel for propellers as a fast,'low-fidelity' tool; and a more computationally intensive, fully compressible Cartesian xxxxxx model as a 'mid-fidelity' tool.   The projected xxxxxx I will implement and test key modeling and formulation improvements for these methods to enable them to support the design of multi-stage open rotor configurations to meet current and projected performance targets.	15973
Distributed Multi-agent Fault Diagnosis and Reconfiguration Control, Phase I	2008-01-01	2018-07-19	"In order to meet the challenges of long-duration space exploration (e.g., missions to the xxxxxx, xxxxxx and beyond), onboard real-time health management of spacecraft that responds rapidly to system and subsystem events is essential.  In response to this need, Qualtech xxxxxxs, xxxxxx. (QSI), in cooperation with xxxxxx xxxxxxersity, proposes to develop a distributed multi-agent fault diagnosis and reconfiguration control (FDR) approach for addressing the health management problem.  The proposed solution uses \"intelligent\" schemes to coordinate local health assessments of multiple interconnected subsystems (\"local diagnosers\") to a convergent and correct global system health assessment.  In addition, the solution recommends relevant system recovery functions based on fault isolation information and fault severity estimates.  Design of local diagnosers for subsystem health assessment utilizes a combination of both model-based and data-driven diagnostic methods in an integrated development environment for accurate root cause isolation."	15974
Collaborative Augmented Reality with Hands-Free Gesture Control for Remote Astronaut Training and Mentoring	2018-08-01	2018-07-19	Augmented Reality (AR), where 3D and 2D images are overlaid on a user's natural field of view like a heads up display, is being developed for use in manned space applications. In the past 2 years, xxxxxx, through AR-exxxxxx, and the European xxxxxx Agency, through MARSOP, have demonstrated the potential of AR to improve hands-on training and just-in-time training (JITT). This research aims demonstrate the feasibility and test the performance of novel hands-free, remote or proximity, and instantaneous collaboration or mentoring between individuals in the AR environment to augment audio communication for training, task completion, and other space applications. Real-time AR collaboration can provide novel, flexible spontaneous communication capabilities not found in current systems. Collaboration would be facilitated by drawing  on, or annotating, preexisting AR graphics using tablets or gesture detection which can also be viewed by other individuals in real time. xxxxxxs-free operation would be accomplished by utilizing radar-based gesture recognition transceivers which are environment-robust and embeddable in rigid materials. They precisely measure motion in 3D, allowing for gestures adapted to limited ranges of motion. Embedded gesture sensors and AR headsets enable potential expansion of use to EVA or other space suit applications. The research proposed aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the combined use of such systems and evaluate their performance.This would fulfill research in Technical Area 04: xxxxxx and Autonomous xxxxxxs xxxxxxtion 4 items 3 and 5 (4.4.3,5). The potential for AR control in EVA applications opens future development in AR communication with autonomous systems (4.4.3). This research by its remote collaborative nature can provide tools that facilitate resource and task allocation, trading and sharing of control, and dialoguemanagement.  xxxxxx: xxxxxx or proximity AR collaboration or mentoring on Earth, in deep sea, or in xxxxxx. Proximity-only AR collaboration or mentoring in deep space or situations with low communication bandwidth to remote sources.xxxxxx: First, the AR collaborative drawing  functionality will be implemented using touchscreens with the AR-exxxxxx system developed at xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Center. Next, gestures appropriate for hands-free drawing  will be developed. These gestures will be integrated into AR-exxxxxx. Sample instruction modules, in increasing sophistication: without AR, with static AR images, with touchscreen AR collaboration, and with radar-based AR gesture collaboration; will be tested with volunteers. The system's impact on user comfort, efficiency, and perceived utility in job environments will be assessed. Iterative, agile approaches will be used to modify software development as assessments reveal areas of needed improvement.Evaluation of AR platforms will use task completion time, the subjective workload assessment tool xxxxxx TLX, and subjective surveys of test subjects to link AR interactivity with changing levels of productivity. Feasibility of radar gesture recognition will be evaluated as recognition accuracy as the percentage of recognized gestures from the number of properly executed gestures during testing.Needed xxxxxxources: The AR-exxxxxx developed at xxxxxx xxxxxx, especially the hardware headset, is needed. Additional xxxxxxsoft Hololens sets will be available for sale in 2016 for the price of $3000 each. For radar-based gesture detection, a development kit from Google ATAP's Project xxxxxxi would provide the sensor and application programming interface, allowing for the rapid creation of gesture recognition patterns. Otherwise, microwave xxxxxx sensors are available commercially off-the-shelf. Doshisha xxxxxxersity in xxxxxx has demonstrated gesture recognition using the commercial NJR4211J xxxxxx sensor.	15975

Risk Engineering, Sciences, Computation, and Informed Decisions, Phase II	2017-03-01	2018-07-19	"Wrong decisions during the missions can lead to an unsafe condition or immediate failure, while correct decisions can help continue the missions even from faulty conditions. In view of the lessons learned from mishaps, i.e., failed space missions, it is imminent that reliability analysis and risk assessment are kept in sync with space system design as it evolves from the concept through preliminary design, detailed design, production, and operations. From the successful proof-of-concept demonstration for the proposal solution in xxxxxx I, Qualtech xxxxxxs, xxxxxx.

Experimental and Analytical Development of a Health Management System for Electro-Mechanical Actuators	2011-06-07	2018-07-19	Expanded deployment of xxxxxx-Mechanical xxxxxxs (EMAs) in critical applications has created much interest in EMA Prognostic Health Management (PHM), a key enabling technology of Condition xxxxxx xxxxxx (CBM). As such, Impact Technologies, LLC is collaborating with the xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx to perform a number of research efforts in support of xxxxxx xxxxxxted Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) initiatives.

Multifunctional Structural Composites for Radiation Shielding, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	"Radiation shielding materials are necessary for protecting astronaut crews from the hazards of space radiation during future xxxxxx missions.  xxxxxxhough polyethylene based materials and composites are attractive for radiation shielding due to high hydrogen content, the poor thermal performance has limited its use as a \"parasitic\", nonstructural material.  Further impeding use of this material is its inherent flammability.  Accordingly, thermally stable structural materials having low flammability combined with radiation shielding are necessary for the development of next generation aerospace structures and vehicles.  It would be further desirable that the non-parasitic material has excellent damage tolerance to mitigate impact events in operation.  xxxxxxlied Poleramic, xxxxxx. proposes to develop a new generation of structural high hydrogen content matrix materials which will be combined with an interlayer modification approach to result in fiber reinforced composite materials having enhanced radiation shielding combined with excellent damage tolerance and improved flammability resistance.  This will be achieved through development of high hydrogen content bismaleimide resins followed by fabricating carbon fiber composites having nuclear grade boron carbide or boron nitride micro-particles in the interlayer region."	15980

Most developments in PHM surround air vehicle subsystems and avionics, specifically on the electronic board level, and many of these are integrated after the systems are designed.  These developments have or are establishing the ability to monitor the degradation of a subsystem in real-time, making it conceivable that actionable information can be fed to a xxxxxxted xxxxxxler for self-repair decisions, leveraging the Propulsion Airframe xxxxxxtion benefits.  Reliability can be calculated and maintenance can be planned ahead of time rather than at the point of failure, significantly increasing safety.  xxxxxxral xxxxxxs, xxxxxxmagnetic xxxxxxs Group (GA) will continue to play a vital role.	15981

Radiation Shield Optimizer using Genetic Algorithms	2015-10-01	2018-07-19	The harmful effects of radiation are one of the most significant challenges to long duration spaceflight. Therefore, we aim to develop a new approach for optimizing radiation shielding materials systems. In particular, we are looking at providing a tool to optimize how materials layers are sequenced in order to enhance radiation shielding as well as to mitigate the effects of secondary radiation. There are two broad scenarios where layering of materials is required in spacecraft and can have an impact on the radiation environment crew and equipment experience, (1) where the layers are deliberately put in sequence for the best shielding;  (2) when materials are required to be in place to serve other functions such as electrical conductors, logistics etc. With the new tool we want to be able to, in both cases, determine the optimum arrangement of these materials for shielding and dynamically so, in the case of logistics. Success in providing the best possible radiation shielding means missions can run longer and safer by getting exposure as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA). Currently, while there are a number of tools that calculate radiation transport (how radiation propagates through a materials system or spacecraft structure), there has been little work looking specifically at how to get the most benefits from sequencing layers of materials and particularly how to do so in a way that is adaptable to the radiation environment that is to be encountered. Typically, a few materials layers that the designer has an intuitive feel might work best are tested (using the transport codes) and the best of those adopted. There is not an exhaustive search of the solution space for the best possible materials configurations. The present approach combines robust physics based tools for radiation transport in materials, with an effective strategy for sifting through a large range of possible shielding layer configurations efficiently. Mimicking the process of natural selection, allows a more thorough search of the space of possible shielding layer configurations by speeding up convergence to effective solutions in an economical (time and computer resources) way. This is particularly important for dynamic solutions such as when considering changing amounts of logistics supplies being used in a radiation shielding application or changing radiation environments. xxxxxxtic xxxxxx also allow for the discovery of hitherto unexpected, non-conventional and non-intuitive shielding layer configurations. 	15983
Modeling Cable-Harness Effects on Spacecraft Structures	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	The proposed research involves modeling the effects of cable-harnesses and wiring on the dynamics of spacecraft structures. As space structure mass decreases due to the use of lightweight materials, the complex cabling systems used on these structures are becoming a greater percentage of the spacecraft mass, and are changing the dynamic responses of the structures. The goal of this proposal is to develop a scientific basis for describing the effect of power and signal cables attached to lightweight, flexible spacecraft structures in order to determine precise analytical models of such systems to gain understanding of the important physical characteristics that affect their dynamic response.In order to characterize the effects of cable harnesses on spacecraft structures, multiple modeling methods will be developed. The analytical methods proposed include homogenization, the theory of combined dynamical systems, and model updating. Homogenization utilizes the repeating nature of the cable attachment points to simplify the equations used to compare the energy of each section to a fundamental beam model. The theory of combined dynamical systems combines the lumped parameters (attachment points) with the distributed parameters (the structure and cables) and then requires singularity and Green's functions to develop equations. xxxxxx updating compares experimental results to existing finite element approximations and adjusts the approximations to more accurately describe the experimentally determined response.In addition to analytical methods, experimental methods will be used to observe and study the effect of cables on structures, and to validate the models developed. An increasingly complex wiring system will be attached to a beam. The dynamic response of the cabled beam will be observed and measured.Specific goals for the first year of research include a method of describing structural cable effects using beam homogenization, culminating in validated homogenization models of cable-harnessed structures; a database of experimental results characterizing the dynamic response of cable-harnessed structures to vibration input; a thorough understanding of experimental requirements and the ability to design and execute a sound and repeatable set of experiments to validate models; and significant progress on methods of describing structural cable effects using the theory of combined dynamical systems and model updating for finite element analysis.This research aligns with xxxxxx xxxxxx 12.2 (xxxxxx), as well as 11.2 (xxxxxx). The vibration of space structures is certainly significant in the study of aeronautics and exploration structures, as any structure being propelled into space will experience vibration and is highly likely to have wiring and cables attached. By understanding the vibration modes and effects of these cabled space structures, we will be able to create precise models to predict spacecraft motion and reduce unwanted vibration. In addition, most spacecraft and satellite control systems are dependent on knowing the motion of the object; by further refining our knowledge of spacecraft vibration, we should be able to more accurately model spacecraft and satellite movement, and thus improve the accuracy of space control systems and operations. This research will contribute to the understanding of the dynamics of these systems, and will allow a greater degree of confidence in models for the systems used in exploration systems and space operations. It could be used to make space structures more robust and stable, control systems more accurate, and eventually improve xxxxxx space and aeronautic technologies.	15984

Adaptive Drainage Slots for Acoustic Noise Attenuation, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Cornerstone xxxxxxearch Group, xxxxxx. (CRG), proposes to demonstrate feasibility in the reduction of noise attributed to drainage slots in jet engine acoustic liners. This will be accomplished through the development of design rules for optimum slot design and the implementation of adaptive material technologies. CRG proposes to bring this technology to a technology readiness level (xxxxxx) 2 after the xxxxxx effort and a xxxxxx 4 after the xxxxxx 2 effort. The proposed innovation lies in the recognition that drainage slots in the honeycomb of an acoustic liner may have a significantly adverse effect on its ability to absorb noise. This limits the ability of the acoustic liner to achieve its full potential. The proposed research will enable the acoustic designer to understand and to accurately model the effects of drainage slots on the acoustic impedance characteristics. It will also provide the impetus to find solutions that will counteract the adverse effects of drainage slots through adaptive means.	15987
Local L2 Thresholding Based Data Mining in Peer-to-Peer Systems	2010-09-22	2018-07-19	In a large network of computers, wireless sensors, or mobile devices, each of the components (hence, peers) has some data about the global status of the system. Many of the functions of the system, such as routing decisions, search strategies, data cleansing, and the assignment of mutual trust, depend on the global status. Therefore, it is essential that the system be able to detect, and react to, changes in its global status. Computing global predicates in such systems is usually very costly. xxxxxxly because of their scale, and in some cases (e.g., sensor networks) also because of the high cost of communication. The cost further increases when the data changes rapidly (due to state changes, node failure, etc.) and computation has to follow these changes. In this paper we describe a two step approach for dealing with these costs. First, we describe a highly efficient local algorithm which detect when the L2 norm of the average data surpasses a threshold. Then, we use this algorithm as a feedback loop for the monitoring of complex predicates on the data – such as the data’s k-means clustering. The efficiency of the L2 algorithm guarantees that so long as the clustering results represent the data (i.e., the data is stationary) few resources are required. When the data undergoes an epoch change – a change in the underlying distribution – and the model no longer represents it, the feedback loop indicates this and the model is rebuilt. Furthermore, the existence of a feedback loop allows using approximate and “best-effort ” methods for constructing the model; if an ill-fit model is built the feedback loop would indicate so, and the model would be rebuilt.	15988

Self-Deploying Tent Array, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	The Self-Deploying Tent Array (SDTA) is a modular power system that can be scaled to very large power levels for use on the xxxxxx surface.  The tent shape is structurally efficient and packages well with a flexible photovoltaic blanket.  The tent array geometry produces a much more constant power output throughout a day than a non-tracking flat array, and provides significant power at sunrise and sunset.  This results in efficiencies in the power processing and storage system, to which the array would be integrated, that reduce the total system mass significantly.  The tent shape is also inherently resistant to dust buildup due to the slope of the arrays, and is amenable to a number of wind loading mitigations that will be examined in xxxxxx I work.  The module self-deploys and can naturally straddle large boulders.  It can clear 0.5 m obstacles on the ground via two deployment schemes that will be examined.   xxxxxx I work will consist of conceptual design of the module, structural analysis & optimization, performance analysis, module sizing within a large array system, and mechanical design of a module.  This will prepare for detail design, manufacture and deployment testing in xxxxxx.	15995

Microfabricated Millimeter-Wave Antenna Arrays, Phase II	2012-06-01	2018-07-19	This proposal addresses the need for an antenna technology platform that meets the requirements of high-performance materials, exacting dimensional tolerances, and the geometrical design freedom to enable planar antenna array technologies for frequencies greater than 90GHz. The PolyStrata fabrication technology, being developed at Nuvotronics, LCC, xxxxxx, VA., is capable of meeting or exceeding all of the requirements outlined to be a solution for these frequencies. Air-filled copper rectangular coaxial transmission lines are fabricated using a photolithographically defined layer-by-layer process. The resulting transmission lines are extremely broadband, low-dispersion, high-isolation, and low loss compared to other forms of planar transmission lines. These lines are smaller than rectangular waveguides because the transverse cross-sections of the lines are not resonant. xxxxxx of this work will include the design, fabrication  and characterization of prototypes that will enable PolyStrata-based frequency-scanned antenna-array operating from 140-160GHz with +/-16 degree beam steering, a beamwidth of 0.5 degrees and 400MHz per beam bandwidth. An antenna array with this performance would require roughly 24cm by 24cm.  This is possible using 4 sub-arrays that each are fabricated on a single wafer and then tied together to achieve the overall system performance. We will develop and deliver prototypes that will be smaller versions of this, but demonstrate all the necessary aspects of the system including the feed network, the antennas, the tiling of subarrays and the connection to the outside world.  The approach will offer a high-yield, cost effective product that will meet the xxxxxx needs.	15997

Integrated Multi-Mode Automation for Trajectory Based Operations, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	Air Traffic Management's lack of support for aircraft with different capabilities is a long standing and persistent issue that can limit the ability of xxxxxx xxxxxx (NAS) to take full advantage of advanced aircraft capabilities. To fully utilize the variety of xxxxxx xxxxxx Operations (TBO) concepts planned for the NAS, some of which utilize advanced aircraft capabilities for implementing trajectories, an air traffic controller (ATC) must be able to simultaneously support a variety of TBO concepts using different aircraft automation systems to fly the desired trajectory. To accomplish this, the ATC needs automation support to simplify the inherent complexities of using a variety of different BO concepts and trajectory implementation strategies and provide the controller with the tools needed to execute the desired trajectories, maintain situational awareness at all times, and support off-nominal situations. IMMA (xxxxxxted xxxxxx-Mode Automation) provides the automation to simplify the inherent complexities of using multiple TBO concepts by focusing the controller interactions on common core functions (e.g., the initial clearance, compliance monitoring) that all TBO concepts must support.	15999
Low coherence, spectrally modulated, spherical wavefront probe for nanometer level free-form metrology, Phase I	2016-03-01	2018-07-19	To-date free-form optic manufacture is limited due to inadequate metrology to  measure surfaces with free-form and conformal shapes, with large surface slopes and to the required measurement uncertainty. In this proposal we describe a new interferometric non-contact probe capable of measuring free-form optics with nanometer sensitivity. The probe has favorable metrology characteristics and uses a new interferometric modality allowing the advantages of low-coherence interferometry in common path interferometer designs. The combination of high acceptance angles and high sensitivity make possible the use of a simple three-orthogonal-axis metrology frame and fulfills the precision requirements demanded by xxxxxx and industry. The projected data acquisition rates in excess of 10kHz will provide an attractive manufacturing metrology tool.	16000
Seeing Sound - Image Analysis of the Lift-off Acoustic Field, Phase II	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	A launch vehicle and its launch facilities are subjected to intense acoustic loads generated by the vehicle's propulsion system. The vehicle, its payload, and facilities must be designed to withstand these loads to ensure mission safety and success. xxxxxxly accounting for the acoustic environment early in the design phase of a new launch vehicle is a high priority. Governments and aerospace entities expend significant resources investigating launch acoustics using a combination of predictive models, full-scale and subscale tests, and test flights. xxxxxxs that acquire acoustic data are deployed over a limited geometry and do not sample the full three-dimensional volume exposed to the acoustic field. Launch imagery samples that three-dimensional volume. Under appropriate conditions, rapidly varying condensation features are generated by the lift-off acoustic field. A software tool will be developed to determine the three-dimensional structure of the field from imagery of these acoustically-induced features. This unique data will be compared to model predictions and will serve to either validate those models or inspire modifications to those models. Improving predictive models contributes to a more reliable and efficient design process for new launch vehicle propulsion systems, and thus reduces associated design costs.	16001
Solar Power Augmented Electrolysis Module for Energy Storage	2013-06-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxting solar photovoltaic power with regenerative fuel cell systems for energy storage can often be very complex and costly.  It usually requires complex power conversion and control interfaces matching the electrical performance of the constituent power providers and consumers with the real-time operational variations (sun or shadow side of orbit) and lifetime variations.  We propose to investigate and demonstrate an alternate means of interfacing solar power to electrolysis modules that are part of base power systems.  Will the results solve all of xxxxxx energy storage problems?  No, but we will investigate a very simple, low-cost, power-following method of interfacing solar power to electrolysis modules in direct current (DC) energy storage systems (a regenerative fuel cell system is a DC energy storage system at the most basic level).  We also see this as a building block technology for terrestrial micro-grid and off-grid energy storage systems.Regenerative fuel cell systems often include a dedicated electrolysis module with solar photovoltaic (PV) panels packaged as a subsystem of the larger energy storage system.  The voltage-current (V-I) performance curves associated with the system modules must be compatible– this often necessitates the use of complex electronic power control elements (xxxxxx converters, DC-AC inverters, etc.).  This proposal will investigate a power-following integration option for solar PV modules into DC base-power systems for dedicated electrolysis module operations without the need for DC power interface elements.	16002
Orbit Databases and Fast Gravity Fields for Rapid Trajectory Design Near Small Bodies	2020-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxentific and engineering interest has recently significantly shifted beyond the large planets and moons, which gravitationally dominate their respective localities, to the smaller, irregularly shaped, comets and asteroids roaming the solar system around us. Due to the multi-body dynamics and highly non-spherical gravity fields common to small bodies, state-of-the-art trajectory design and re-design around small bodies can be a slow, ground-based process requiring significant input from specialists. At the same time, the smaller scales and vast number of asteroids and comets often requires rapid recalculation of orbits and trajectories. Part of the solution to these conflicting realities is the fundamental ability to rapidly design trajectories around small bodies. By applying and enhancing fast gravity field techniques, implementing grid searches and root solvers to find useful periodic and quasi-periodic orbits, the proposed research aims to create and innovatively use a new catalogue of trajectories around small bodies of interest to enable rapid trajectory design in those environments.Though there has been extensive research into various methods of generating gravity fields for small, irregularly shaped bodies, these methods have not yet been applied to a large set of mission candidate bodies in varied dynamical environments, nor have they been adapted or enhanced to suit the needs of the rapid trajectory design problem at small bodies. Among these are:1) xxxxxxive computation of the potential field must be fast and efficient enough to allow rapid exploration of the trajectory design space, science instrument and experiment simulations, and in-mission trajectory re-design; and, 2) Acceleration values must adhere closely enough to reality to provide accurate trajectories, even in the presence of dynamics uncertainty and the need for rigorous xxxxxx simulations.Therefore, the research team seeks to study alternative ideas for basis functions and interpolation techniques, and implement the best solution for a broad set of small bodies of interest. The research team will also investigate interpolated gravity fields for the particular case of onboard use, since the spacecraft only requires a small local field representation to be stored onboard. To achieve speedups in field calculation and trajectory design times, modern parallel computing techniques and uncertainty quantification analysis will be leveraged.xxxxxx small-body orbit and trajectory design methods do not typically include higher-order shape irregularities in their dynamical models, nor do studies developing more detailed gravity field models conduct comprehensive orbit and trajectory searches using those models. To address both of these issues, the research team plans to conduct an exhaustive search for stable orbits and trajectories around a wide set of candidate small bodies, taking advantage of the implementation of the fast accurate gravity field calculation developed in the first objective. The purpose of this orbit archive will be to ease the rapid trajectory design and optimization processes on the ground and onboard a spacecraft by providing a large set of good initial guesses for targeted trajectories. This archive of orbits (analogous to xxxxxx orbits in the two body problem), will also provide options for science orbits, and transfers between science orbits.By extending the topics of fast accurate gravity field modeling and rapid small-body trajectory design and coupling the interactions between them in a catalogue of stable orbits and trajectories around real small bodies, the proposed research will expand and enable more rapid and thorough searches of the orbit design space around small bodies. This innovation is an important step toward lowering xxxxxx mission costs because it allows pre- and post-launch quick redesigns of trajectories, as well as faster evaluation of trade-offs between proposed mission scenarios.	16003
A High Efficiency Cryocooler for In-Space Cryogenic Propellant Storage, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx is considering multiple missions involving long-term cryogen storage in space.  xxxxxx hydrogen and liquid oxygen are the typical cryogens as they provide the highest specific impulse of practical chemical propellants.  These cryogens are stored at temperatures of nominally 20 K for hydrogen and 90 K for oxygen.  Due to the large size of these tanks, refrigeration loads to maintain zero-boil-off are high, on the order of 10's of watts at 20 K and 100's of watts at 90 K.  xxxxxx cryocoolers have been developed for cooling space sensors that have modest cooling loads and are not suitable for high capacity applications.  On this program, we propose to develop a high capacity turbo-xxxxxx cryocooler that provides 150 W of refrigeration at 90 K.  On the xxxxxx I project, we will design the cryocooler, assessing the size, mass, and performance, and assess development risks.  On the xxxxxx project, we will develop and demonstrate a critical cryocooler component.  In xxxxxx, we will build and demonstrate an engineering model cryocooler.  Successful completion of this project fills a clear void in space cryocooler technology.	16004
Synthetic Receptor-Based Biosensor for Safety and Security Applications, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	This project will develop a sensitive and specific biosensor worthy of field deployment for autonomous operations.  The underlying technology will enable in situ detection of terror agents in the cargo space of an aircraft or in airports and thereby reduce vulnerability of the Air Transportation system.  There is a critical need for sensitive, rugged biosensors capable of performing assays under harsh conditions with minimal crew attention for decreasing the time and cost of analyses.  Toward that goal, tasks have been designed in this xxxxxx I proposal to develop a biosensor using molecularly imprinted polymers - a class of synthetic receptors that can be tailored to selectively interact with analytes for which recognition molecules of biological origin may not be available. The feasibility of a sensor array will be demonstrated by using nerve agent simulants. A prototype sensor array device, and smart signal processing algorithm will be developed in xxxxxx.  For xxxxxx manufacturing engineering and xxxxxx follow-on funding, discussions have been held with two potential partners. A highly proficient engineering team, with a cumulative 70 person-years of experience in materials science and optical sensors, is in place to develop the biosensor.	16005
Slow Light Based On-Chip High Resolution Fourier Transform Spectrometer For Geostationary Imaging of Atmospheric Greenhouse Gases, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx transform spectroscopy (FTS) in infrared wavelength range is an effective measure for global greenhouse gas monitoring. xxxxxxver, conventional FTS instruments are bulky, heavy, and frail to environmental vibration, making them not suitable for satellite platforms. In this proposal, Omega xxxxxxics, xxxxxx., together with the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx at xxxxxx, proposes a slow light enhanced on-chip FTS array covering compound spectral wavelength range (1.1 ~ 6.2 &#61549;m) for geostationary imaging of greenhouse gases. Each array pixel is made of a xxxxxx-Zehnder interferometer, one arm of which is conventional waveguide and the other is 'fishbone' slow light waveguide. Harnessing the nonlinear phase enhancement generated by the slow light effect of the 'fishbone' waveguide, a resolution better than 0.2 cm-2 can be readily achieved within a limited chip surface. An N x M array can be formed by integrating N pixels on one silicon-on-sapphire chip and stacking M chips. Leveraging the CMOS compatible fabrication process, the imaging unit can be xxxxxx per pixel and the whole imaging array weights ~ 30g. In addition, the whole module does not have moving parts, making it an ideal candidate for airborne and spaceborne applications.	16006
Development of Design Tools for the Optimization of Biologically Based Control Systems	2016-10-01	2018-07-19	I plan to develop software that aids in the design of biomimetic control systems by optimizing the properties of the system in order to produce the desired output. xxxxxxly based control systems offer legged vehicles an advantage over the current state of the art. Legged locomotion is the result of many complex, coordinated movements throughout the body, and requires a control system just as complex to produce useful propulsion. Designing such a system from scratch, however, is not easily done without quantification and optimization. Our group has produced some promising legged robot controllers composed of simulated neurons and synapses in a design based on an animal system, but in order to achieve the coordination and adaptability of an actual organism in a particular robot, the properties of each neuron, synapse, and muscle must be tuned. Therefore, if a reliable biologically based control system is to be developed, the entire system, neural and mechanical, must be optimized.	16007
An Alternative Ice Protection System for Turbine Engine Inlets, Phase II	2007-11-01	2018-07-19	The innovation combines a new generation low power ice protection system with a novel path to certification that is based upon requirements that turbine engines be capable of operation in a hail environment. Eliminated are requirements for high voltages and currents characteristic of all previous impulsive or expulsive deicing systems. It is postulated that if the engine can operate safely in the hail environment as defined by the FARs, then it can be expected to operate safely and economically in the presence of particles shed by the deicer which are demonstrably smaller and less hazardous than hail. Such a system presents a viable alternative to the use of hot air ice protection systems, and will require a two magnitude lower power.	16008
Variable Speed Rotor System, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	Variable speed rotors will give helicopters several advantages: higher top speed, greater fuel efficiency, momentary emergency over-power, resonance detuning capability and a reduction in noise.  The applicant proposes to develop such a system using a doubly-fed planetary gear box with advanced xxxxxx-based power electronics and motors.  The new components enabling variable speed will be rated at a fraction of the total helicopter power rating, thus reducing weight dramatically. The resulting hybrid mechanical/electrical power system also gives, in addition to greater fuel efficiency, smooth continuous speed variations with electronics, inherent starting capability (e.g., elimination of the existing starter motor), simplification of the tail rotor system, and the ability to enhance power to the main rotor with batteries and the APU.  Feasibility will be determined in xxxxxx I by the applicant with the assistance of a major helicopter manufacturer.	16009
Miniature Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer for In-Situ Resource Utilization, Phase II	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	In situ resource utilization (ISRU) is essential for several of xxxxxx future flagship missions.  Currently envisioned ISRU plants include production of oxygen from hydrogen reduction of lunar regolith and extraction of water from xxxxxx regolith or asteroid material.  xxxxxx xxxxxx & Environmental xxxxxx and xxxxxx & xxxxxx xxxxxx Extraction (RESOLVE) mission's objectives are to analyze the distribution of volatile compounds in the lunar surface and to demonstrate ISRU operation on the moon.  To support ISRU activities, xxxxxx requires the development of a compact, lightweight gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) instrument that can quantify volatile gases with masses below atomic number 70 released by sample heating.  The instrument must also be designed to withstand exposure to the release of HF, HCl, or Hg that may result from heating regolith samples to high temperatures.  Creare proposes to design, build, and test a compact, lightweight GC/MS system capable of detecting, identifying, and quantifying 100 ppm to 100%-level concentrations of relevant compounds having mass less than 70 amu.  Our GC/MS design is based on components that can be space qualified using techniques proven on numerous past space hardware development projects.  During the xxxxxx I project, we proved our design with benchtop testing, and in xxxxxx, we plan to build a brassboard version of our GC/MS that will meet the important performance requirements for the intended application.	16010
Towards A Model-based Prognostics Methodology for Electrolytic Capacitors: A Case Study Based on Electrical Overstress Accelerated Aging	2013-06-19	2018-07-19	A remaining useful life prediction methodology for elec- trolytic capacitors is presented. This methodology adopts a xxxxxx filter approach in conjunction with an empirical state-based degradation model to predict the degradation of capacitor parameters through the life of the capacitor. Elec- trolytic capacitors are used in several applications ranging from power supplies on critical avionics equipment to power drivers for electro-mechanical actuators. These devices are known for their comparatively low reliability and given their criticality in electronics subsystems they are good candi- dates for component level prognostics and health manage- ment. Prognostics provides a way to assess remaining use- ful life of a capacitor based on its current state of health and its anticipated future usage and operational conditions. This paper discusses the empirical degradation models and experi- mental results of an accelerated aging test performed on a set of identical capacitors subjected to electrical stress. The data form the basis for developing the xxxxxx-filter based remain- ing life prediction algorithm.	16011
Cosmic Dust Catalog	2018-06-25	2018-07-19	Since May 1981, the xxxxxxional Aeronautics and xxxxxx Administration (xxxxxx) has used aircraft to collect cosmic dust (CD) particles from Earth's stratosphere. Specially designed dust collectors are prepared for flight and processed after flight in an ultraclean (Class-100) laboratory constructed for this purpose at xxxxxx (JSC) in xxxxxx, xxxxxx. xxxxxx are individually retrieved from the collectors, examined and cataloged, and then made available to the scientific community for research. Cosmic dust thereby joins lunar samples and meteorites as an additional source of extraterrestrial materials for scientific study.	16012

Precision Locking and Control of CW Lasers in Support of ASCENDS, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx Photonics proposes to design and build significantly improved laser frequency locking and control systems that will be suitable for ASCENDS and other xxxxxx sensing needs. Precision laser frequency control (absolute frequency to better than 1 MHz with rapid tuning over 10's to 100's of GHz) for lasers in both the 1.57 xxxxxx overtone region for direct xxxxxx detection and around 1.53 µm, which may be doubled to reach the O2 A-band spectral-trough feature at 764.7 nm, will be developed and provided.  The laser locking and control will employ either calibrated sweep techniques or high-speed frequency offset phase locking.  xxxxxx wavelength references will be maintained to better than 2 MHz via either direct locking to a xxxxxx line or locking to the HCN R(22) line at 1529.38 nm, which when doubled is directly at the 764.7 nm O2 spectral trough feature.  Prototype locking and control systems will be delivered at the end of phase I (xxxxxx will transition from 4 to 5 during phase I) and a complete, ready to use laser system will be delivered at the end of phase II (xxxxxx 6 or 7 at end of phase II).	16014
Single Crystal Piezoelectric Deformable Mirrors with High Actuator Density and Large Stroke, Phase II	2011-07-01	2018-07-19	Single crystal piezoelectric deformable mirrors with high actuator density, fine pitch, large stroke and no floating wires will be developed for future xxxxxx science and communications applications. Single crystal piezoelectric DMs share the fine pitch with co-fired electrostrictive or ceramic piezoelectric DMs and MEMS DMs, but with large stroke at relatively low voltages ( 300K). Specifically,  a 32x32 actuator array with stroke > 2 um, pitch of  12 um, pitch of < 2mm will be developed for fine and coarse DMs. xxxxxx driving electronics will be scaled up to a multi-channel actuator driver and optimization of the design, facesheet mounting process and characterizations for deformable mirrors will be investigated.	16015
Reusable Nanocomposite Membranes for the Selective Recovery of Nutrients in Space, Phase I	2018-06-01	2018-07-19	Through the STTR program, xxxxxxSonic and xxxxxx will create low-cost, reusable membranes that selectively capture and recycle nutrients (e.g., N, P, K) from urine in space.  xxxxxx is a readily available commodity in space that is rich in valuable nutrients for plant growth.  Humans produce individually about 500 L of urine per year that contains ~7 g/L of nitrogen (N), ~1 g/L phosphorous (P), and ~2 g/L potassium (K).  xxxxxxSonic shall fabricate tailored nanocomposite ultrafiltration membranes that selectively capture key nutrients from urine through tailored binding chemistries, while filtering away undesirable components including sodium.  The nutrients will then be eluted from the membrane and available in a useful form for direct application on plant soil.  xxxxxxSonic's membranes have excellent chemical and mechanical properties allowing for repeated use over long time periods, thereby limiting the need for replacement.  Moreover, their high thermal transition temperature (~190C) permits serviceability in space where the temperature can range from ~-150C to +120C.  Our STTR partners, Professors He and Vikesland in Civil and Environmental xxxxxxing at xxxxxx, are experts in nutrient recovery and the use of nanotechnology for wastewater treatment. During xxxxxx I, together with xxxxxx, xxxxxxSonic will increase the xxxxxx Readiness xxxxxx (xxxxxx) from 3 to 5 of our simple, lightweight, and low-cost filtration membranes through membrane analyses. xxxxxx 7 shall be achieved during xxxxxx with industry support from our Environmental xxxxxxing partners at 3e for nutrient extraction from urine to be deployed for plant growth in space on board xxxxxx (xxxxxx).	16016

MEMS Skin Friction Sensor, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Interdisciplinary Consulting Corporation proposes a sensor that offers the unique capability to make non-intrusive, direct, simultaneous mean and fluctuating shear stress measurement for subsonic and transonic test applications. Currently a standard for shear stress measurement tool does not exist.A precise silicon micromachined, differential capacitive, instrumentation grade sensor will facilitate skin friction measurement with high bandwidth, high resolution, and minimal sensitivity to pressure. The proposed sensor possesses through wafer vias for backside electrical contacts to enable non-intrusive measurements in turbulent boundary layers. A robust and compact package with miniature interface electronics enables flush sensor mounting conformal with surfaces.  The sensor development effort transitions a proof-of-concept device by adding design components to have reduced pressure sensitivity to result in a commercially viable product. Circuit topology development for biasing and signal conditioning provides the ability to make simultaneous mean and dynamic shear stress measurement. The sensor performance will exceed its predecessors and set the standard for quantitative skin friction measurements. The simplicity of sensor design and an equally simple and proven fabrication technique allows for low cost, high performance sensors.The sensor holds promise to transform current flow control techniques and enable efficient aerodynamic designs. Existing shear stress estimation techniques rely on known correlation to a measured quantity. Direct measurement eliminates the need for a known correlation in an unknown flow. xxxxxx transduction has been successful for a highly sensitive device with a large dynamic range and low noise floor, which is the current state of the art. The proposed sensor may therefore be improved beyond the state of the art to serve as a measurement standard for all types of skin friction measurement techniques.	16023

Electrospray Collection of Airborne Contaminants, Phase II	2009-12-01	2018-07-19	"In stark contrast to current stagnation-based methods for capturing airborne particulates and biological aerosols, our demonstrated, cost-effective electrospray technology employs an entirely different approach based on the remarkable effectiveness of small, highly charged liquid droplets formed from an electrospray source to \"getter\" both particles and polar molecules dispersed in a gas. Less capable and expensive collection system technologies are generally based on stagnation of high velocity ambient airflow on a collecting surface. The momentum of particles and heavy molecules precludes their following gas streamlines during this stagnation. Instead, they concentrate and are trapped on the detector's surface if the surface is \"sticky,\" or concentrated in the surface boundary layer, which can be separated from the mainstream flow and collected. Typically, current separation methodology collects about 50 percent of the particles between 1.0 and 10 microns in diameter from a flow of 500 L/min with a power consumption of up to 500 watts; i.e., about 1 watt of power is required for a small fan to compress 1 liter of air per minute to produce the high velocity airflow necessary for effective trapping of small bio-particles and heavy molecules. xxxxxxver, our electrospray technology consumes negligible power and achieves virtually 100 percent particle collection. In fact, we have demonstrated that the power efficiency of electrospray gettering for a single electrospray emitter to collect 100 percent of the particles, often without a fan, at 10,000 times greater than the power efficiency of state of the art systems."	16025

Pneubotics - Membrane-Based Robotics for Remote Material Handling, Phase II	2017-06-01	2018-07-19	We have invented a new class of robotics, called `Pneubotics', that rival current manipulators in payload and reach at 1/10th the weight. Our technology leverages insights into lightweight materials and mass manufacturing to create robots that derive power, structure, and movement from pressurized air. As a result, drive trains, motors, bearings, shafts, sliding surfaces, and excess structural material are eliminated, leading to robots with extremely high strength to weight ratios, inherently human safe operation, and high degrees of freedom at low part count. This transformative new technology has the potential to enable the widespread use of automated handling of material and equipment on missions in low Earth orbit and beyond. The compliant nature of these robotic systems allows them to robustly grasp arbitrarily shaped objects and makes them ideal for operating around sensitive equipment and materials or cooperatively with humans. Similarly, due to their fluidic architecture they can be deflated and stowed for efficient transport. The work described in this phase II xxxxxx proposal would integrate the component development and analysis performed in xxxxxx I to build and test a full prototype manipulation system. By incorporating optical, internal, and tactile sensors and multi-level controls that take advantage of the unique characteristics of the manipulator and seek out appropriate contact to guide motion rather than avoiding it. By testing the entire prototype system in the field we will demonstrate operation in the ground environment and learn valuable lessons for IVA and EVA applications.	16029
Autonomous Power Controller for Mission Critical Microgrids, Phase I	2018-06-01	2018-07-19	PCKA is partnering with researchers at CWRU to develop an Autonomous xxxxxx Controller (APC) for mission-critical microgrids to supply electric power in a highly autonomous and secure manner to accomplish mission objectives. The APC consists of a centralized controller connected to an array of local component controllers. The centralized controller will be capable of optimal generation and load scheduling, abnormal conditions and/or failure detection, and system restoration, while the local controllers monitor system components and pass sensor data to the centralized controller. The core of the APC is a database architecture that facilitates data movement to enable the various control functions. The design of this database was carried out by the PI, Dr. xxxxxx in a 2016 collaboration with xxxxxx GRC, and it will be leveraged in this STTR effort to support the expansion of the APC. The effort will also utilize a spacecraft system simulator tool developed by PCKA. Therefore, the team is well-placed to successfully develop the APC. Potential applications of the APC will be in deep space explorations, aeronautic flights, and special human habitats, where human supervision of the electric power systems is limited and availability of electric power is critical to mission success.	16030
3-D Nanofilm Primary Li Air Battery, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx requires a new primary battery capable of providing specific energy exceeding 2000Wh/kg over an operating temperature range of 0oC to 35oC with a shelf life exceeding 2 years in support of Exploration Medical xxxxxx. Metal/air chemistries such as aluminum/air or lithium/air are suggested due to their high theoretical specific capacity.Recent attempts by others at Li-air batteries have provided limited energy and unacceptably poor rate performance due to their use of composite air cathodes. Such composites combine sub-optimal micro-porous powder with low-surface area, poorly distributed, un-optimized electro-catalyst and non-electrochemically contributing binder.Ionova Technologies, xxxxxx. proposes a new Li-air battery utilizing a binderless 3-D nanofilm air cathode comprising a networked mesoporous carbon structure decorated with novel, highly reactive, ultra-high surface area catalysts. Pore size/structure and catalyst distribution are optimized to promote oxygen diffusion and to reduce pore clogging from reaction products while maximizing reaction sites to increase capacity and current density. The proposed electro-catalyst exhibits specific capacity that exceeds what has been demonstrated by other catalyst materials in the research literature. Cumulatively, the 3-D nanofilm Li-air approach is anticipated to improve energy and power densities vs. other approaches by improving discharge capacity and current density.This project will investigate the feasibility of the 3-D nanofilm approach to improve diffusion and reaction kinetics in a primary Li-air battery through modeling and materials/lab cell characterization to xxxxxx3. xxxxxx4 will be achieved by mid-phase II and xxxxxx will be achieved by end phase II.	16031

Safe, High Specific Energy & Power Li-ion Cells	2017-09-01	2018-07-19	Today&rsquo;s best, safe commercial xxxxxx cell designs achieve ~180 Wh/kg, ~500 Wh/L, and 400 W/kg. When accounting for the lightest (1.35) parasitic mass and smallest (2.0) parasitic volume factors of proven battery construction features, this means that at the battery level we need improvements of 144% and 170%, respectively, to achieve our specific energy (&gt;325 Wh/kg) and energy density (&gt;540 Wh/L) performance targets. Today&rsquo;s best commercial xxxxxx cell designs offer the promise of a 47% and 82% improvements, respectively, over the State of the Art&nbsp;as shown in xxxxxx. 1 below. Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t implement these new cell designs, which are safe enough for small consumer batteries but are unsafe for larger manned applications due to the high propensity for them to side wall rupture during thermal runaway.This proposal offers to overcome this safety issue and enable significant progress towards the Evolving xxxxxx Campaign (EMC) target. We seek our advanced battery designs to be passively propagation resistant to a single cell thermal runaway (TR). xxxxxx to this goal is greatly reducing the risk of side wall rupture of the hot thermal runaway products ejected from the cell (a.k.a., ejecta). Side wall ruptures create a blow torch effect&nbsp;which, when impinging on adjacent cells, causes nearly immediate TR propagation in a closely-packed battery designs.The higher energy content (265 Wh/kg, 725 Wh/L) of the newer cell designs from LG, Panasonic, and Samsung have made them susceptible to side wall ruptures during thermal runaway, rather than venting through the intended vent path in the cell header. This is also due to higher reaction kinetics of the electrochemistry, thinner can walls, tight crimp enclosure of the cell header, and inadequate flow rate through the header vent. Tesla Motors was the first to recognize and address this issue by asking cell manufacturers to produce cell designs with bottom burst disc vents. &nbsp;xxxxxxver, those designs exclusively for Tesla and not available to others. Thus, we must stay with lower performing cell designs or implement structural supporting features for the cells in the battery designs. Both options limit battery achievable specific energy to at best 133 Wh/kg. Being able to safely implement the newest cell designs with bottom vents will enable reaching 196 Wh/kg at the battery level. This 47% improvement would save 24 lbs per each 4 kWh xxxxxxV battery or 96 lbs per xxxxxxV flight or enable 1 hour flight run time for the X-57 electric plane by saving 282 lbs from their 46 kWh battery. Similar volume savings impacts are possible by retiring the side wall rupture risk, because it allows cells to be safely nested together more efficiently. These sizable mass/volume savings and safety improvements are aligned with the needs of the EMC.Safe, higher performing batteries are well aligned with EMC needs for high specific power, high specific energy batteries, long life batteries, and deep space suit specific energies &nbsp;&gt;235 Wh/kg.The required vent paths are achieved by scoring a groove pattern in bottom of the mild steel can. xxxxxxhough they look simple, achieving a reliably performing bottom vent is not trivial. xxxxxx designs are excessively susceptible to corrosion, leakage, damage, and poor performance uniformity. The important question that this research project will answer is whether our design will significantly reduce the side wall rupture risk without significant limitations, such as leakage, corrosion, and excessive performance variations.The scope of the project includes conducting TR tests on similar cells with and without the bottom vent to show the merits of the bottom vent feature. Just 3 months ago, Sony Energy became the first to make a commercially available, high performing design with a bottom vent. We have taken delivery of 400 such SONY cells last month. LG Chem, Ltd., has not publically released a comparable 18650 cell design with a bottom vent yet but is willing to produce small batches of cells with and without them for xxxxxx for this project.The next challenge is how to trigger TR in a manner relevant to latent defect induced cell internal short circuits, like the ones that are the cause of field incidents of TR. External heating to the point of TR with a heater is known to weaken the cell can and induce a high frequency of side wall ruptures. Slow oven heating of cells is induces cell venting many minutes to hours before TR occurs and dries out the cell prior to the onset of TR. It is questionable whether a cell with less quantity of electrolyte generates the same TR thermal output.Our implantable wax insulated internal short circuit (ISC) device that the PI co-invented with NREL has been very successful in inducing TR on-demand with just a modest heat input to &gt;57&deg;C to melt the wax and internally short the cell. Without the device, one must heat the cell &gt;130&deg;C to drive TR. Our first implantation in a batch of a very high energy LG cell design (265 Wh/kg) was very successful and reveals that, with the device in the outer winds of the jellyroll, it is very prone to experiencing a side wall rupture. All our previous attempts to structurally weaken cell cans have proven to not be as reliable in inducing side wall ruptures as the ISC device.The test plan involves four insightful tests. First, we will determine the vent pressures for the top vents and bottom vents of the cell designs by pneumatic testing. Then, we will drive cells into TR, in quantities sufficient to be statistically significant with and without the bottom vent using the ISC device and with no structural support. Next, we will compare the TR thermal output in our cell TR calorimeter. Cells with a bottom vent are expected to eject a higher fraction of the energy rather transferring that energy through the cell can wall. This is important behavior to discern and quantify for high performing, safe battery designs.

Vorticity State Estimation For Aeroelastic Control, Phase I	2013-02-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx control, structural reliability, and efficiency depend critically on the ability to assess the time-accurate unsteady aerodynamic loads and moments for each lifting surface under nominal and adverse flow conditions. xxxxxx and xxxxxx Institute of xxxxxx propose to develop a flow control system that utilizes advanced sensors and a vorticity state estimator (VSE) to reach flow states unattainable without continuous control feedback. The flow control scheme enables manipulation of the vorticity state to achieve performance objectives, such as short take-off/landing through controlled aerodynamic lift at angles of attack near stall.	16035
A Compact, Radiation Hardened, Stable, Low Power, Programmable Crystal Oscillator for Extreme Temperature and High Reliability Space Application, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	We propose a feasibility study of a fully intgrated radiation hardened (>1Mrad/si), programmable crystal oscilator (RPXO) in a miniature package that will deliver stable clock signal output under extreme temperature range from -230C to +200C. The innovations envisioned for RPXO will include a radiation hardened SiGe ASIC with HBT configuration for the analog section and CMOS configuration for the digital part. Recent research results of SiGe show excellent promise for a very wide operating temperature and high TID. Special design techniques will be studied and evaluated to reduce or eliminate SEL condition. Another innovation is an assembly that includes the crystal resonator and its mechanical support that will withstand the extreme temperature range as well as more than 2000 thermal cycles as experienced on xxxxxx and xxxxxx. Finite element analysis will be the main tool to establish confidence in the design study of the thermo-mechanical portions of the RPXO including package related mechanical interfaces. The microelecronic package will be commercially available and reflect a standard form-factor. It will hold all of the said elements and include provisions for programmability features of the RPXO. The package study will evaluate leadless version and compliant lead alternative configuration to facilitate the application of the device on PCB. All RPXO assembly process will be commercially viable and based on proven, and reliable techniques.	16036

A miniaturized UV/VIS/IR hyperspectral radiometer for autonomous airborne and underwater imaging spectroscopy of coastal and oceanic environments, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx sensing of optical properties of oceans and coastal waters provides essential information for various scientific questions and applications, including monitoring biological biomass and productivity, biogeochemical cycling of carbon, pollution, and ecosystem health.  OKSI, with the Scripps xxxxxx of xxxxxxgraphy (SIO), propose the development of novel instrumentation package that will measure in both airborne and submersible applications the upwelling and downwelling radiative fluxes in the UV-VIS-NIR range with high spectral resolution.In xxxxxx I science requirements will be defined and translated into engineering requirements, and the design of an existing hyperspectral sensor modified to (1) simultaneously measure both the upwelling (in pushbroom imaging mode) and the downwelling (non-imaging) spectra, and (2) extend the spectral range to the UV.  In xxxxxx the prototype instruments will be built and flown on a SIO xxxxxx Aerial Vehicle and tested in an SIO submersible system.  Ocean color satellite data currently provides information at low spectral resolution (several discrete wavebands) and relatively low spatial resolution (~1 km).  The proposed instrumentation package will fill a major gap in science capabilities by providing hyperspectral data with sufficiently high spatial resolution necessary for improved retrievals of information about in-water constituents/properties in highly dynamic coastal environments.  The project outcome at the end of xxxxxx will be at xxxxxx 6.	16038

Redundant StarShade Truss Deployment Motor/Cable Assembly, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	"The proposed innovations are as follows:1)    A fully redundant electrical and mechanical motor/cable deployment assembly2)    A redundant motor/cable deployment assembly that is integrated and deploys a perimeter truss for a starshadeThe significance and relevance of the proposed innovations is to meet the technical challenges of deploying a large scale perimeter truss (10-30m diameter) for a starshade.The STDT's \"Exo-S Final xxxxxx\"  identified an open issue to \"Mature perimeter truss technology readiness.\"  This is part of a defined starshade technology gap S-5 that is titled \"Demonstrate inner disk deployment with optical shield.\"  In the xxxxxx JPL starshade design the petals are placed into their precise position by the deploying truss.  The truss also deploys the spiral wrapped inner disk and at the end tensions the precision spokes.  If the truss was not able to fully deploy or meet the on-orbit load (deployment and deployed) and positioning requirements then the mission would fail.  Obviously the truss deployment mechanism needs to be a robust and reliable system."	16040
Developing Near Real-time Data-assimilative Models and Tools for the Space Environment, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The IDA4D and AMIE data assimilation methods are currently of limited use for real-time space weather applications because either they don't run in real-time (IDA4D) or the real-time version (AMIE) does not ingest the full complement of data needed to provide high fidelity outputs. To correct this situation, in xxxxxx-I, we propose to demonstrate the feasibility of augmenting these algorithms so that they run in real-time, with the full complement of available data for ingestion. In xxxxxx-I we will establish detailed system performance requirements and conceptual designs that will drive the development efforts to be performed in xxxxxx. This will include constraints such as the size and resource expectations for the codes, as well as the necessary interfaces and resources for the collection and storage of data sets to be used in the assimilation, and how to respond to missing or corrupted data. An assessment of costs to build a real-time assimilative modeling capability using IDA4D and AMIE, and the cost to maintain and upgrade in the future will also be provided. The research conducted in phase-i will show a clear path towards a phase II prototype demonstration.  In future xxxxxx work, ASTRA will implement the augmentation of the existing IDA4D and AMIE algorithms to real-time operations, based on the conceptual designs and requirements established in xxxxxx-I. Each requirement will be associated with a method of verification to be implemented in xxxxxx. The resulting data assimilative algorithms will be transferred to xxxxxx, where they will be transformative for space weather operations. This innovation will enable the development of near real-time data-assimilative models and tools, for both solar quiet and active times, which allow for precise specification and forecasts of the space environment, beginning with solar eruptions and propagation, and including ionospheric electron density specification.	16041

My research will utilize novel experimental methodologies including SEM-DIC, Acoustic Emission, and Electrical xxxxxx measurements to provide guidelines on how to mitigate premature component failure through the design of damage-tolerant architectures. I will first perform a suite of room-temperature monotonic and dwell fatigue-cracking studies, and use the resulting data to guide elevated temperature testing. I will combine automated SEM, chemically functionalized self-assemblies of nanoparticles on CMC specimen surfaces, and spatially and temporally distortion-corrected digital image correlation, to enable the acquisition of large, information-rich data sets with extremely high resolution and accuracy. Adopting this new approach towards the characterization of CMCs will allow me to integrate statistical and unsupervised learning methods with materials science in order to examine stochastic behaviors, such as the effect of subsurface composite architecture, on damage accumulation under various oxidative and thermo-mechanical loads.	16043
Advanced Scintillating Fiber Technology in High Energy Neutron Spectrometers for Exploration	2016-03-01	2018-07-19	High energy neutron spectrometers are being developed to measure the energy spectrum of neutrons, which are a component of the space radiation environment. Energetic neutrons are harmful to space systems and space crews in unique ways. To quantify these harmful effects it is necessary to identify the neutron component in the space radiation environment and measure its energy spectrum. The key to this measurement is identifying the neutron. We will develop new scintillating optical fiber technology that greatly improves the identification of neutron-capture signals over the current state-of-the-art. These fibers will be embedded in a large plastic scintillator to create a neutron detector. This detector will be tested in a simulated spacecraft radiation environment to demonstrate the performance of these fibers as neutron identifiers.	16044
Incremental Evolution of a 10/250 NLV into a 20/450 NMSLV, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	"The technical innovation proposed here is the continued functional evolution and concept refinement of an incremental series of test vehicles that will ultimately provide dedicated, low-cost, reliable, on-demand routine space access for the emerging nano and micro satellite markets.  Initial orbital operational capability for delivering 10 kg to a 250 km circular LEO is achieved with a two-stage, pressure-fed \"10/250\" xxxxxx Launch Vehicle (NLV) that will pathfind performance, production, regulatory and operational challenges.  This NLV will then be followed by a clustered \"20/450\" xxxxxx/xxxxxx xxxxxx Launch Vehicle (NMSLV) that addresses this topic's primary objective of providing a capability to place nano and micro satellites weighing up to 20 kg into 450 km circular LEO.Aggressive leveraging of our team's existing NLV development initiative enables significant hardware development and the start of static fire testing during xxxxxx I, followed by actual flight testing in xxxxxx for xxxxxx-7 technology evaluations.  These tests have incrementally introduced state of the art capabilities like advanced propellants (LOX/propylene) and structures (composite cryogenic tanks).  The xxxxxx I effort focuses on the development of the next class of test vehicle &#150; a high altitude suborbital single booster stage (the \"P-K\") that features closed-loop thrust vector control (TVC) and candidate avionics technologies for guidance and navigation, as well as eventual autonomous flight termination systems (AFTS) for range safety, TxxxxxxSS-based telemetry and tracking functions.  In addition, it will incorporate features needed to implement the clustered first stage configuration and second stage separation method associated with the 20/450 NMSLV. xxxxxx effort will then focus on the further development of an NMSLV-type first stage with two additional  core boosters, for a total of three, and the conducting of a high-altitude demonstration flight."	16045

Characterization and Modeling of Fundamental Parameters of a Membrane-Aerated Biological Reactor	2017-08-01	2018-07-19	Inherent in the expansion of human presence in space is the development of life support systems that are capable of meeting the demands of extended space habitation. Within these systems, water is the most critical life support element, representing, at minimum, 65% of the daily mass input for crew members. A reliable water source is therefore a critical item for long term space habitation, whether in orbit (e.g. xxxxxx), on the moon, xxxxxx or beyond. Water recycling systems allow the regeneration of potable water from waste streams, thus eliminating mission dependence on initial water reserves or resupply scenarios. xxxxxxver, current water recovery systems that employ only physical and chemical processes are intensive users of resources and ultimately result in trading the cost of stored water for the costs of power consumption and consumables. xxxxxx aerated biological reactors (xxxxxxs) provide an attractive sustainable alternative due to the ability to maximize effluent quality, and recycle valuable components (e.g. xxxxxx, N2).  xxxxxxs harness the benefits of biological treatment (transformation of organic matter and xxxxxx to xxxxxx, NOx- and N2 gas, production of a more stable end waste product , and favorable pHs for further physio-chemical treatment) while also minimizing the impact on the habitation environment and decreasing the demand for inputs such as O2 by increasing removal efficiency. Much of the current research on xxxxxxs provides results that are specific to the reactor configuration or the particular waste-stream loading. Current design and operation is at best semi-empirical as a number of interrelated fundamental processes including biological, physical, and chemical processes are not currently described sufficiently to allow the development of quantitative robust models.  The proposed work will provide essential characterization of xxxxxx systems and develop a quantitative understanding of the interdependence of gas flow, loading rate, biofilm microbial ecology, and membrane density in order to optimize the design and operation of xxxxxxs. The successful completion of this objective would be the development of guiding principles based on the waste stream composition and desired treatment levels.  Experimental data will be collected from a bench-scale reactors designed and operated at xxxxxx Tech xxxxxxersity.  Additionally, data will be collected from the Counter-diffusion xxxxxx Aerated Nitrifying Denitrifying Reactor (CoMANDR) developed at xxxxxx Tech xxxxxxersity and scheduled for implementation as part of an integrated system test conducted at xxxxxx xxxxxx.  The experimental data will be used to develop and validate theoretical models that can be used as predictive tools for operation and design of further xxxxxx systems. The benefits of this research will not only apply to space based water reuse, but will also have numerous terrestrial applications thus continuing the legacy of space based technologies providing significant benefits to broader applications.	16047
3D Microfabricated Low Loss Reconfigurable Components, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	Typical communication satellites use traditional waveguide front-end architectures due to excellent electrical performance and high reliability. xxxxxxver, these systems are extremely massive and use large volume mostly due to the low-insertion loss waveguide. Replacement of the waveguide components by microfabricated parts without substantially affecting the electrical performance can lead to a breakthrough in wireless communications.The overall goal of the proposed xxxxxx project is to develop low-cost, reliable, miniaturized RF MEMS switch components suitable for a variety of communication subsystems. Two approaches will be investigated. The first approach will be looking at monolithically integrating RF MEMS switches within the PolyStrataTM technology, developed at Nuvotronics in xxxxxx, VA as part of the DAxxxxxx 3DMERFS program. This approach should enable disruptive low-loss and high-Q RF components from S-band up to W-band. The second approach will rely on state of the art known good RF switches to be assembled on the low loss PolyStrata backplane. This second approach will provide lower loss, higher density and higher power handling than the current RF MEMS components. The proposed technology can be applied to multiple operating frequencies at a minimum cost due to the batch capability of the PolyStrata process.	16048
ZnO UV Detectors, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	Radiation-hard UV detectors will be developed with xxxxxx in xxxxxx I efforts by MOXtronics, xxxxxx.

MOX has achieved several breakthroughs for making p-type xxxxxx and xxxxxx p-n junction/xxxxxx diodes, which allows fabrication of xxxxxx UV detectors.  High-efficiency xxxxxx UV detectors will be fabricated on xxxxxx substrates by using xxxxxx PIN structures.  In xxxxxx I, xxxxxx PIN diodes for UV detection will be fabricated and demonstrated.  High-efficiency solar-blind xxxxxx UV detectors will be developed in future xxxxxx efforts.	16049
Integrated Composite Structure for EDL Application, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx has defined a need for higher performance ablative Thermal Protection xxxxxx (TPS) materials for future exploration of our solar system's inner and outer planets than is currently available.  Of particular interest are: 1) Materials with performance analogous to fully dense, heritage rayon-based carbon phenolic ; 2) xxxxxx-density ablative systems ; and 3) xxxxxx insulative, low-density materials.  xxxxxx, xxxxxx (MSR), and xxxxxx xxxxxx, xxxxxx & xxxxxxding (xxxxxx EDL) are all potential missions for these new and/or enhanced TPS materials, but the general desire is that these TPS be tunable for cross-cutting mission applications.  In addition to improved TPS performance, xxxxxx would benefit from a TPS integrated with the sub-structure thereby improving thermal efficiency, insulation performance, system thermal-structural performance, and system integrity with the goal of achieving increased system reliability, reduced areal mass, and/or decreased costs over the current state-of-the-art (SOTA).FMI proposes developing its multi-layered, graded, hybrid ICS system for application to xxxxxx missions.  The system is comprised of distinct material layers encompassing different fillers or reinforcements, but maintaining the same resin so the materials are compatible for co-curing to yield a continuous rigid heatshield and sub-structure (ICS).	16050

VG2 NEP PLS DERIVED RDR ION INBOUND S-WIND 48SEC V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	This data set gives the best available values for ion densities, temperatures, and velocities near xxxxxx derived from data obtained by the Voyager 2 plasma experiment. All parameters are obtained by fitting the observed spectra (current as a function of energy) with xxxxxxian plasma distributions, using a non-linear least squares fitting routine to find the plasma parameters which, when coupled with the full instrument response, best simulate the data. The PLS instrument measures energy/charge, so composition is not uniquely determined but can be deduced in some cases by the separation of the observed current peaks in energy (assuming the plasma is co-moving). In the upstream solar wind protons are fit to the M-long data since high energy resolution is needed to obtain accurate plasma parameters. In the magnetosheath the ion flux so low that several L-long spectra (3-5) had to be averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ratio to a level at which the data could be reliably fit. These averaged spectra were fit using 2 proton maxwellians with the same velocity. The values given in the upstream magnetosheath are the total density and the density-weighted temperature. In both the upstream solar wind and magnetosheath full vector velocities, densities and temperatures are derived for each fit component. In the magnetosphere spectra do not contain enough information to obtain full velocity vectors, so flow is assumed to be purely azimuthal. In some cases the azimuthal velocity is a fit parameter, in some cases rigid corotation is assumed. In the 'outer' magnetosphere (L>5) two distinct current peaks appear in the spectra H+ and N+. In the inner magnetosphere the plasma is hot and the composition is ambiguous, although two superimposed xxxxxxians are still required to fit the data. These spectra are fit using two compositions, one with H+ and N+ and the second with two H+ components. The N+ composition is preferred by the data provider. All fit values in the magnetosphere come with one sigma errors. It should be noted that no attempt has been made to account for the spacecraft potential, which is probably about -10 V in this region and will effect the density and velocity values. In the outbound magnetosheath and solar wind both moment and fit values are given for velocity, density, and thermal speed. The signal-to-noise ratio in the M-longs is very low, especially near the magnetopause, which can xxxxxxult in the analysis giving incorrect values. The L-long spectra have too low an energy resolution to permit accurate determinations parameters in many regions temperature and non-radial velocity components may be inaccurate.	16052
Transmission and Distribution of Photosymthetically Active Radiation (PAR) for Biomass Production in Exploration Missions [7216-050], Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxical xxxxxxs xxxxxx. (PSI) proposes to develop a plant lighting system which collects, transmits and distributes photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) for biomass production in planetary and transit missions.  In this system, solar light or electric lamp light is collected by reflector optics and focused at the end of an optical fiber cable.  The light is filtered by a selective wavelength filter to reject the non-PAR spectra to minimize heat generation within the plant growth chamber.  The PAR spectra are transmitted to the plant growth chamber where the light is uniformly distributed over the plant growth area at optimum intensities.xxxxxx features of the proposed system are: (1) the PAR can be transmitted via a flexible optical fiber cable to plants away from the light source; (2) only the PAR will be transmitted to the plant, minimizing the thermal loading in the plant growth chamber, while the non-PAR spectra can be converted to electricity by means of low band-gap PV cells; (3) the low profile light diffuser makes more volume available for plant growth; and (4) the electric light source can be chosen for the best system efficiency and can be placed at the location best suited for thermal control.	16053
Photonic IC Spectrometer for Spacecraft, Phase I	2017-06-01	2018-07-19	CubeSat/SmallSat bus infrastructure imposes stringent mass, power, footprint, and volume constraints on science instruments such as spectrometers.  xxxxxxhmics, xxxxxx., proposes teaming with researchers at the Catholic xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx (CUA) to develop a real-time spectrometer that demonstrates photonic integrated circuit (IC) interferometric capabilities for the first time in the MWIR spectral band, and achieves extremely low size, weight and power (SWaP).  The xxxxxxhmics/CUA team proposes in xxxxxx I to design and fabricate a proof of concept (PoC) photonic IC spectrometer operating in the MWIR, with xxxxxx 3.  xxxxxx testing of the xxxxxx I photonic IC device will strengthen the scaled-up photonic IC spectrometer prototype design for xxxxxx. The CUA research partner will perform finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modeling and simulation.  In xxxxxx, the team will fabricate and test the scaled-up photonic IC spectrometer prototype, achieving xxxxxx 6.  The photonic IC spectrometer uses an array of interferometers that are microfabricated on the IC to output a real-time spatial interference pattern that is similar to the spectrograph obtained via time-scanning in xxxxxx transform spectroscopy (FTS) such as xxxxxx transform spectroscopy (FTIR). xxxxxxver, the photonic IC spectrograph is instantaneous and obtained by an instrument with no moving parts, similar to a class of devices called a spatial heterodyne spectrometer (SHS).  A stack of photonic IC spectrometers acts as a one-dimensional (1D) imaging array and performs hyperspectral imaging for remote sensing and other applications.  Wavelengths in the MWIR range (~3-5 micrometers) will allow the use of common microfabrication techniques and materials, which will keep costs low.  Our expertise in developing planar waveguide structures places xxxxxxhmics in a unique position for fabricating photonic IC spectrometers.	16054

The Conductive Thermal Control Material Systems for Space Applications, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	This proposal is submitted to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of processing the space environment stable, multifunctional thermal control material system (TCMS) that can be applied to space hardware and can enables the hardware to carry higher leakage current through engineering the high electrical conductivity. An innovative space environmental stable TCMS is suggested through research & development work for the multifunctional, low (&#945;S/&#949;T) material systems that can meet these aggressive goals in cost effective, reliable manner. The suggested efforts emphasize developments in two material science areas: the first one considers the development of born nitride nano structure that includes nanotubes and nano mesh (BNNT-BNNMTM) and the second area proposes the synthesis and processing of various homologous compounds of xxxxxx that are recently identified as the high conductivity compounds with high refractive index. The material system that integrates these two technologies can allow higher leakage currents that may also help to defend against the natural solar storm events. The suggested TCMS have been derived from the available mathematical models for space craft charging that pay attention to the individual charge dissipation mechanisms and the molecular dynamics of the material systems as well as its thermodynamics. Thus the envisioned derived material systems can provide the needed reliable TCMS in typical space environments in (LEO), (GEO) & beyond. The reliability goal for the multifunctional conductive TCMS is to have a design life of > 10 years in LEO and > 15 years in GEO, and we anticipate the developments to mature by end of phase II ready for the hardware demonstration.	16063

Wireless Integrated Microelectronic Vacuum Sensor System, Phase II	2008-12-01	2018-07-19	The efficient utilization of ground test facilities and launch sites is critical for the success of xxxxxx xxxxxx Vision for xxxxxx Exploration.  The development of an innovative Wireless xxxxxxted xxxxxxelectronic xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx for monitoring vacuum-jacketed pipelines is proposed that would address the need of xxxxxx for measurements of the insulating capability of cryogenic lines for ground testing, flight vehicles, and launch facilities.  Recent advances in both MEMS vacuum gauge technology and low-power, long range radio frequency transceivers has enabled the development of a low-cost, miniature device with sophisticated capabilities.  The complete, self-contained, battery operated system would fit within the volume of the current vacuum gauges only and provide periodic, continuous monitoring of vacuum conditions throughout the entire facility.  Such a system would reduce operations costs and increase vacuum jacket reliability by eliminating the need for human intervention, reduce package, wiring size and weight, and provide constant network reporting and monitoring of the facility from any Internet enabled computer.  Beyond this application for vacuum monitoring, the long-range wireless sensor networking capabilities developed under this program would be applicable to a vast array of other sensor types and control applications throughout xxxxxx and other xxxxxx facilities.	16066
Solid Oxide Electrolysis for Oxygen Production in an ARS, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxment Corporation proposes an innovative, efficient and practical concept that utilizes xxxxxx Oxide xxxxxxlysis for regenerative air revitalization.  The concept is innovative because it safely eliminates handling of hydrogen, and works irrespective of gravity and pressure environments with no moving parts and no multi-phase flows.  The innovation is efficient because it requires no expendables while being compact with minimal impact on mass.  The innovation is practical because it evolves from the well-established, current state of the art in oxygen production for the regenerative air revitalization system slated for xxxxxx.  The approach proposed addresses the crux of the innovation in xxxxxx I through modeling and experimentation to immediately identify the most feasible approach to its implementation.  xxxxxx will encompass more detailed experimentation to optimize the subsystem design resulting in a fully functioning regenerative oxygen subsystem for advanced life support.  The consequence is significant because solid oxide electrolysis is an inherently suitable technology (and possibly the only technology) for enabling 100% oxygen regeneration from carbon dioxide and water vapor, two byproducts of crew activity that must be managed regardless.	16067

Adaptive Augmenting Control and Launch Vehicle Adaptive Control Flight Experiments	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	xxxxxxearchers at xxxxxx are working to further the development of an adaptive augmenting control algorithm (AAC). The AAC was developed to improve the performance and robustness of xxxxxx&#39;s xxxxxx Launch xxxxxx (SLS) during extreme, unanticipated events well outside the rocket&rsquo;s design envelope. The SLS is expected to produce more thrust and deliver more payload to orbit than any other launch vehicle, opening the way to new frontiers of space exploration. The AAC will use sensed data to autonomously adjust to unexpected conditions during flight to ensure that the SLS does not deviate from its trajectory or experience unstable propellant slosh or vehicle flexure.A series of LVAC flight experiments conducted at xxxxxx successfully increased the technology readiness level of an adaptive augmenting control (AAC) algorithm from 5 to 7. To validate the algorithm&rsquo;s effectiveness, researchers installed the prototype AAC flight software into xxxxxx&#39;s Full-Scale xxxxxxanced xxxxxxs xxxxxx (FAST), giving it full authority control over the aircraft&rsquo;s aerodynamic effectors. xxxxxx&rsquo;s FAST aircraft then simulated multiple failure scenarios the SLS may experience as it makes its way from the launch pad to booster separation. These tests provided valuable data that both proved the AAC technology and will aid its future development.Work to date: The LVAC experiment included six research flights in late 2013. The FAST aircraft flew trajectories similar to the ones the SLS will follow, and the system was evaluated in a variety of scenarios for up to 70 seconds at a time, matching the SLS dynamics for the majority of its flight from liftoff to solid rocket booster separation. A total of 104 test points were completed, covering 14 simulated failure scenarios and off-nominal events. The controller was evaluated with and without adaptive control for each test case to provide a basis for comparison. In the final flights, two experienced test pilots provided evaluations of interactions between the manual steering mode and the AAC for several of the test cases.Looking ahead: The flight test data are being used to refine the AAC software and plans for future tests. The first flight of the SLS, with the AAC algorithm enabled, is scheduled for 2018.xxxxxx Partners: xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Center, xxxxxxing and Safety Center, and xxxxxx xxxxxx Mission Directorate&#39;s Game xxxxxxing xxxxxxment ProgramBenefits:Cost-effective: xxxxxxd the AAC to be evaluated in-flight without having to be launched into spacexxxxxxatic: Allowed multiple, repeated tests with different configurations to compare and isolate characteristics of the designxxxxxx: Provided full-scale, high-performance piloted testbed with a proven research flight control system, extensive research instrumentation, data downlink for real-time experiment monitoring, and an experienced flight research teamxxxxxxovative: FAST test team proposed and supported additional AAC flight test objectives as the project progressedxxxxxx: The AAC algorithm has applications to civilian, fly-by-wire transports, and high-performance military aircraft. The techniques for conducting the LVAC experiment, and the metrics used in evaluating its results, are applicable to flight research into other adaptive control methods and autonomous systems.	16072
Devices and Methods for Collection and Concentration of Air and Surface Samples for Improved Detection of Microbes onboard ISS, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	Protecting xxxxxx (xxxxxx) crew from microbial contaminants is of great importance.  xxxxxxl and fungal contamination of air, surfaces and water aboard xxxxxx has the potential to cause sickness among xxxxxx crew and to impact onboard experiments.  Further, it has been noted that pathogenicity and virulence of microbes can increase in microgravity environments.  These factors, along with the high consequence of sickness in the remote space environment, creates a significant need for a rapid way to determine when microbial contamination events occur.  To this end, xxxxxxovaPrep LLC of Drexel, MO proposes development of improved methods for collection of microbes from air and surfaces for delivery into a small liquid volume compatible with advanced molecular based detection systems. xxxxxx microbiological detection systems have taken dramatic steps forward in the last two decades and today detection of even a single organism is possible in less than one hour.  Unfortunately, development of rapid detection methods has far outpaced development of sample collection and concentration techniques, which are necessary to enable detection of low microbial concentrations in the environment.  In the proposed xxxxxx I work, xxxxxxovaPrep will leverage current aerosol and surface collection and elution technologies and innovations from a 2015 xxxxxx awarded xxxxxx for microbial concentration from xxxxxx potable water, for handling of these technologies in a microgravity environment, to develop novel xxxxxx aerosol and surface collection systems.  Specifically, xxxxxxovaPrep will develop new, optimized aerosol filter assemblies and surface sampling assemblies that allow for collection from larger air volumes and surface areas and elution into smaller liquid volumes than is currently possible.	16073

This paper presents an integrated model-based diagnostic and prognos- tic framework, where we make use of a com- mon modeling paradigm to model both the nom- inal and faulty behavior in all aspects of systems health monitoring. We illustrate our approach us- ing a simulated propellant loading system that in- cludes tanks, valves, and pumps.	16075
High Temperature Electrical Insulation Materials for Space Applications, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx future space science missions cannot be realized without the state of the art high temperature insulation materials of which higher working temperature, high reliability, and low cost are highly desired. T/J Technologies proposes to develop a high temperature, durable, readily processable electrical insulation materials.  The key element of our approach is the development and demonstration, in a breadboard configuration, the feasibility of a new high temperature polymeric composite material based on organic-inorganic nanocomposites with tailored structure and composition that will dramatically increase xxxxxx and working temperature of the host polymer, polyimides. Future work of this proposed research, during phase II, will be mainly focused on developing all the associated technologies.

An IntegratedTurbulence Hazard Decision Aid for the Cockpit, Phase II	2007-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx encounters with turbulence are the leading cause of injuries in the airline industry and result in significant human, operational, and maintenance costs to the airline community each year.  A large contributor to the above injuries and costs is that flight crews do not have sufficient situational awareness of the location and severity of potential turbulence hazards to their aircraft.  AeroTech will improve pilots' situational awareness of turbulence hazards by developing a cockpit Turbulence xxxxxx Decision Aid that provides them with integrated, graphical turbulence hazard information scaled to their specific aircraft.  This display will remove the need for inference that is required to interpret current turbulence information.  With better knowledge of turbulence hazards' severity and location, pilots will be able to avoid turbulence encounters or prepare for them by having all occupants seated with seatbelts on, thereby avoiding injuries.  xxxxxx work will develop a prototype decision aid, based on the xxxxxx I CONOPS and results, and then evaluate the prototype in both a PC simulation and a flight simulator.  By the end of xxxxxx a meaningful, xxxxxxted Turbulence xxxxxx Decision Aid will be developed and tested, paving the way for flight evaluations and commercialization in xxxxxx.	16078

Liquid-Liquid Heat Exchanger With Zero Interpath Leakage, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	Future manned spacecraft will require thermal management systems that effectively and safely control the temperature in inhabited modules.  xxxxxx heat exchangers will be required that isolate the heat transfer fluid in the spacecraft thermal bus from the circulating water used to cool inhabited modules.  We propose to develop an innovative heat exchanger that provides two completely independent physical barriers between the two fluids in the interface heat exchanger.  This isolated flow path heat exchanger incorporates two key innovations: (1) an innovative and simple core construction that separates the two fluids while providing a large heat transfer area, and (2) innovative materials that enable efficient heat transfer between the two fluid streams.  The proposed heat exchanger is lightweight, efficient, and simple to fabricate.  xxxxxx I proves the feasibility of our approach through laboratory demonstrations of the key technologies.  In xxxxxx we will design, build, and demonstrate performance of a full-scale interface heat exchanger sized for a specific xxxxxx application.	16081
An Alternative Ice Protection System for Turbine Engine Inlets, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	This proposal presents a dual approach to the development and certification of an alternative system for ice protection of turbine engine inlets.  It combines a new generation low power ice protection system with a novel path to certification that is based upon requirements that turbine engines be capable of operation in a hail environment.  Eliminated are requirements for high voltages and currents characteristic of all previous impulsive or expulsive deicing systems.  It is postulated that if the engine can operate safely in the hail environment as defined by the FARs, then it can be expected to operate safely and economically in the presence of particles shed by the deicer which are demonstrably smaller and less hazardous than hail. Such a system presents a viable alternative to the use of hot air ice protection systems.	16082

Aircraft Electrical Power System Diagnostics and Health Management, Phase II	2010-02-01	2018-07-19	The objective of the project is the development of an open architecture, computational toolbox for design and implementation of diagnostic and prognostic algorithms for aircraft electrical power systems. The management of typical failure modes of the electrical system can have substantial returns in the overall availability, safety and operating cost of aircraft. We propose several innovative techniques for monitoring specific components of the power system such as generators, converters, and batteries. The integrated architecture using general purpose symbolic processing, numerical tools and data logging makes this project especially attractive and will bring advances in diagnostics and prognostics to engineering practice. The toolbox will include code generation tools resulting in the ability to seamlessly integrate the designed algorithms by automating several key steps for the implementation phase. In xxxxxx I we have demonstrated the approach using simulations and experimental test beds. The successful completion of this phase of the project provided a prototype health monitoring system and established a framework to integrate new algorithms allowing the rapid packaging of advanced health management techniques for validation and verification, flight certification and final system integration and evaluation. In xxxxxx, we will develop a diagnostics and prognostics toolbox that will allow the transition of advanced techniques for on-line health monitoring of power system components to operational situations.  xxxxxx from the computational toolbox will be useful for scheduling both routine and preventive maintenance. The developed software and real time implementations will be well suited for packaging and integrating into vehicle health management systems for both military and commercial aircraft.	16088

Automatic Solar and Celestial Navigation on the Moon and Mars, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx-xxxxxx proposes to develop a low mass, automated form of the classic navigator's bubble sextant, with no moving parts, for rapid localization and reliable navigation on the xxxxxx and xxxxxx.  xxxxxx, night, near side and far side lunar operations will all be handled. Exploration of the xxxxxx (or xxxxxx) without navigation aids comparable to those now common on Earth is a daunting, and generally unacceptable concept.  Since neither body has a significant magnetic field, even a compass is useless.  Creating and sustaining a GPS type satellite constellation will not occur soon.  But the self contained, automated system xxxxxx-xxxxxx proposes is an excellent substitute. It can be installed on top of an astronaut's helmet, or atop a vehicle, in extended EVA. With exploration extended into terrain where a vehicle is likely to become immobilized,  but access by a walking human is practical, vast areas of currently unknown territory can be examined at very close range.   But an hour's trek into convoluted terrain can leave the trekker seriously disoriented, and subject to human course decisions which could prove fatal. The helmet mount system  will provide continuous EVA crew localization for emergency walk back to a safe haven, even if that path crosses unexplored territory.  xxxxxx asset or notable planetary feature localization will also be straightforward at any point in the EVA.  The proposed optical navigation system uses production, solid state camera modules for xxxxxxar, xxxxxx, and xxxxxx sight readings, all with an accurate artificial horizon. But the accuracy required is produced by xxxxxx-xxxxxx proprietary \"xxxxxx Pixel\" processing techniques. xxxxxx localization accuracy will exceed ¼ mile.  With the excellent directional reference also produced, this information will make visual identification of relevant terrain features easy."	16091
Accelerating Memory-Access-Limited HPC Applications via Novel Fast Data Compression, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	"A fast-paced continual increase on the ratio of CPU to memory speed feeds an exponentially growing limitation for extracting performance from xxxxxx systems. Ongoing developments and trends make it clear that this ratio will keep increasing over the next decade. Breaking this memory wall is one of the most important challenges that the xxxxxx community faces today. In this project we introduce novel and highly effective ways of attacking the memory wall through the use of \"compressive computing,\" a theory that we have invented, developed, and successfully put into practice in other areas of xxxxxx with paradigm-shifting results. Once integrated into memory-bound xxxxxx applications, the proposed technology will support significant acceleration factors (typically beyond 2x) without compromising the numerical accuracy of the application code.  In xxxxxx I we will develop the fundamentals of the theory of compressive computing for memory access acceleration, deploy a set of functional components, and produce a fully functional prototype that demonstrates convincingly that the technology works for acceleration of memory-bound applications. The prototype will be integrated in at least one NAS xxxxxx. In xxxxxx we will focus our work on maturing and refining the technology, and will be driven by a concrete target of accelerating at least two memory-access-bound xxxxxx applications. Five of the top eight most-used application codes in xxxxxx supercomputers have already signed-in as early integrators of the technology. We have secured complementary funds in the amount of $150,000 that we will be able to use to increase resources and ensure that all xxxxxx I proposed work will be successfully accomplished in a timely manner, and a total of $500,000 to ensure a successful and early penetration of the proposed technology into the market."	16092

A Real-Time Fault Management Software System for Distributed Environments, Phase II	2016-04-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx (FM) is critical to mission operations and particularly so for complex instruments &#150; such as those used for aircraft and spacecraft. FM software and methodologies, however, too often have nagging limitations that restrict utility, and research and development continues to grapple relative to advancements in the complex systems they monitor. xxxxxx spacecraft, for example, may have thousands of sensors and hundreds of systems/subsystems (and extensive cabling) but relatively few FM co-solutions. Theoretically, the overall FM challenge is in monitoring, modeling, and managing the huge numbers of signals and then determining how to detect them and set appropriate handling actions.For complex systems FM is not trivial, and automated FM is tasked with catching potential failure conditions within interconnected networks before consequences elevate. Ensuring fault coverage while maintaining system reliability under these circumstances is a daunting challenge for even the most capable team, and from anecdotal evidence, it is apparent that FM remains partly elusive.Our xxxxxx project herein involves the research and development of an innovative FM software solution called \"DyMA-FM\" (Dynamic xxxxxxvariate Assessment for xxxxxx). As software, it uses model-based reasoning in a distributed processing environment for real-time detection and response to fault conditions.xxxxxxing on the xxxxxx I successes, in the course of this xxxxxx we will further develop the DyMA-FM concept as an innovative full prototype FM software application, having a tiered hierarchical architecture design leveraging advances in mathematical modeling.

The team will also develop an improved protocol for testing radiation shielding material. This effort will entail developing a composite material which uses proven radiation shielding material xxxxxx(PE), as its primary constituent in the form of very strong/tough xxxxxx fibers woven into a 3D fabric.

Metrics for Evaluating Performance of Prognostics Techniques	2011-06-07	2018-07-19	Prognostics is an emerging concept in condition based maintenance (CBM) of critical systems. Along with developing the fundamentals of being able to confidently predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL), the technology calls for fielded applications as it inches towards maturation. This requires a stringent performance evaluation so that the significance of the concept can be fully exploited. Currently, prognostics concepts lack standard definitions and suffer from ambiguous and inconsistent interpretations. This lack of standards is in part due to the varied end-user requirements for different applications, time scales, available information, domain dynamics, etc. to name a few issues. Instead, the research community has used a variety of metrics based largely on convenience with respect to their respective requirements. Very little attention has been focused on establishing a common ground to compare different efforts. This paper surveys the metrics that are already used for prognostics in a variety of domains including medicine, nuclear, automotive, aerospace, and electronics. It also considers other domains that involve prediction-related tasks, such as weather and finance.  Differences and similarities between these domains and health maintenance have been analyzed to help understand what performance evaluation methods may or may not be borrowed. Further, these metrics have been categorized in several ways that may be useful in deciding upon a suitable subset for aspecific application. Some important prognostic concepts have been defined using a notational framework that enables interpretation of different metrics coherently. Last, but not the least, a list of metrics has been suggested to assess critical aspects of RUL predictions before they are fielded in real applications.	16097

Dynamical Model of Rocket Propellant Loading with Liquid Hydrogen	2014-01-07	2018-07-19	A dynamical model describing the multi-stage process of rocket propellant loading has been developed. It accounts for both the nominal and faulty regimes of cryogenic fuel loading when liquid hydrogen is moved from a storage tank to an external tank via a transfer line. By employing basic conservation laws, the reduced, lumped-parameter model takes into consideration the major multi-phase mass and energy exchange processes involved, such as highly non-equilibrium condensation-evaporation of hydrogen, pressurization of the tanks, and liquid hydrogen and hydrogen vapor flows in the presence of pressurizing helium gas. A self-consistent theory of dynamical condensation-evaporation has been developed that incorporates heat flow by both conduction and convection through the liquid-vapor interface inside the tanks. A simulation has been developed in xxxxxx for a generic refueling system that involves the solution of a system of ordinary integro-differential equations. The results of these simulations are in good agreement with xxxxxx refueling data.	16102

In addition, we will investigate the need to inspect through multi-layer insulation layer (MLI).The goal is to demonstrate feasibility of (i) volumetric stress monitoring using light weight, surface mounted MSGs, and (ii) practical, portable and easy to interpret NDE for use by crews during spaceflight, with limited training and minimal logistics support. xxxxxx purpose electronics will be adapted to the constraints of spaceflight for NDE and MSG data acquisition and the feasibility of developing extremely light weight and small form factor electronics suitable for space flight will be investigated. This proposal is founded on successful implementations of xxxxxx MWM-Array technology for xxxxxx leading edge xxxxxx and recent feasibility demonstrations for MSG volumetric stress monitoring on COPV sections. The MWM-Arrays and MSGs use linear drive winding constructs to selectively induce eddy currents in different fiber layers to assess damage and monitor stresses.	16103
A Three-Dimensional Nanoporous Silicon Anode for High-Energy Density Lithium-ion Batteries, Phase I	2012-08-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx phase I program is directed toward the development of novel, nanoporous silica anodes for low-earth-orbiting (LEO) spacecraft power applications. Silica has attracted a lot of attention as a next-generation anode material because of its very high theoretical capacity compared to state-of-the-art graphitic carbon anodes. xxxxxxver, its use in xxxxxx battery applications is limited by its poor cycle stability caused by large volume changes experienced during Li insertion and extraction. The unique pore structure of materials developed in this program will overcome this limitation and realize rechargeable xxxxxx cells with high-specific energy and extremely stable cycle life for LEO spacecraft power applications.	16104
Advanced Coating Technology for Enhanced Performance of Microchannel Plates for UV Detectors, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	In this xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx I proposal we propose to apply a highly conformal coating of xxxxxx and xxxxxx or a double layer of xxxxxx to the surface and internal pore walls of conventional microchannel plates (MCP). This will lead to enhanced secondary electron emission (SEE) and, thus, improve MCP gain for UV /X-ray detectors. The xxxxxx/ALN(xxxxxx) hetrostructure using nano xxxxxx needles as templates has been demonstrated to exhibit significantly higher SEE yield for electrons, ions and X-ray beams. The coatings will be carrid out by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The key advantages of ALD include 1)super conformity of coatings and nearly 100% step coverage on very high aspect ratio substrates, which is well suited for coating highly porous MCP wafers with a aspect ration xxxxxx; 2)super thickness and composition control; 3)continuous and pin hole free quality films; and 4) easy to scale up for large area deposition at low cost. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time the advanced ALD process has been proposed as a way of improving UV detector performance of MCPS. If successful, this technology will provide an effective  method of modifing the MCP surfaces by coating  them with high SEE yield films that will dramatically improve the gain of conventional MCPs. This will enhance the performance of UV detectors required for various xxxxxx missions.	16105

These reusable technologies, already developed under a xxxxxx contract, are also applicable to unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and will provide a portable, faster-than-real-time test bed capable of dynamic analysis, fault injection, and automated testing, including xxxxxx analysis.  This test bed, named xxxxxx (PVATS), leverages TMC's existing virtualization and modeling technologies to create a virtual environment that includes a CPU instruction set emulator and modeled UAS components such as sensors and actuators, and which executes in an automated virtual machine.  The PVATS goals are to directly improve the timeliness and thoroughness of test and evaluation outcomes while reducing costs and increasing UAS flight software assurance.  The three targeted goals are 1) xxxxxx of UAS flight software, 2) Assist UAS software development and early testing by providing many portable virtual test environments to developers, and 3) Training of UAS operators using a virtual environment.	16106
1.57 Micron High Pulse Energy Single Frequency Fiber Laser, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	We propose to demonstrate and build a 1.572 micron single frequency high pulse energy and high peak power fiber laser by using an innovative Er-doped gain fiber with large core diameter and high gain per unit length. 1.572 micron single frequency high energy and high peak power fiber laser is needed for accurately measuring column xxxxxx concentrations . In xxxxxx I, we will design and fabricate the large core diameter fiber, demonstrate high gain per unit length at 1.572 micron, and demonstrate high pulse energy and high peak power fiber laser with a short piece of gain fiber. Successful demonstration of such a fiber laser will enable many new xxxxxx and commercial applications.	16107

High Specific Energy Lithium-ion Batteries with Novel Cathode, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	Energy xxxxxx is a critical component of space-based platforms across the full spectrum of exploration, scientific experimentation, defense, communications and monitoring missions.  xxxxxx has set targets of 265 Wh/kg of 675 Wh/l for batteries for near-term energy storage applications. xxxxxx battery technology has the highest energy density among rechargeable battery technologies. xxxxxxver, achieving the near-term goals require implementation of next-generation active materials. We propose to develop xxxxxx cells that meet xxxxxx near term targets by combining our CAM-7 cathode material, the highest energy content market-ready cathode material available with market-ready Si-based anode materials.  Because of its high reversible capacity (> 205 mAh/g), high discharge voltage (average 3.85 V vs. Li) and high density (4.8 g/cc), CAM-7 can yield higher energy xxxxxx cells than any other market-ready cathode material.  A version of CAM-7 targeting portable power and vehicle applications has been fully developed and, as part of its commercialization, is currently being transitioned to a 50 ton per year plant in xxxxxx. In the proposed xxxxxx I program, TIAX will optimize the CAM-7 composition to yield the highest possible cell energy while still meeting the life targets, and simultaneously optimize an anode electrode incorporating a market-ready Si-based material.  TIAX will then combine them in xxxxxx cells that demonstrate the resulting system's ability to meet all xxxxxx near-term energy, performance and life targets.  The xxxxxx I program will demonstrate, at the 200 mAh cell level, performance and cycling of electrode designs projected to meet and exceed xxxxxx near-term targets when they are incorporated in 18650 cells.  A successful xxxxxx I program will be followed by a xxxxxx program in which such 18650 cells are developed, assembled, and rigorously tested against xxxxxx requirements.	16113
Novel Ring-Configuration Double-Acting Free-Piston Stirling Convertor, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxx-2015 xxxxxx seeks to evaluate and advance xxxxxx convertors as a potentially more efficient alternative to the radioisotope-heated thermoelectric power generators used on some xxxxxx space missions.  Most free-piston xxxxxx (FPS) convertors are piston-displacer machines that use complex gas bearing/ flexure strategies to manage the wear of reciprocating and close-fitting internal components.  The reliability of these mechanisms is critical to overall system performance and longevity.  xxxxxx, LLC has developed a double-acting free-piston xxxxxx arrangement that eliminates displacers and the problem of displacer seal wear while at the same time reducing the number of distinct parts required for the machine. The key design features of the new convertor most relevant to the space power application include: integrated alternator functionality within the piston assembly, eliminating connecting structures and buffer volumes with associated pressure walls, thereby reducing system mass compared to conventional technology, compatibility with simple lightweight hydrodynamic gas bearings to eliminate piston seal wear, dynamically-balanced radial layout that surrounds the heat source at the center, and heat rejection to ambient at the outer perimeter.	16114
Carbon Nanotube Infused Launch Vehicle Structures	2019-07-01	2018-07-19	For the past 5 years xxxxxx ATK has been investing in, prototyping, and testing carbon nanotube infused composite structures to evaluate their impact on launch vehicle structural damping. Improvements to structural damping would be revolutionary to launch vehicle design.For any vehicle a significant portion of design, material, and integration efforts center on mitigating the severe dynamic environments seen during flight. This includes launch acoustics, random vibration, sinusoidal vibration, and shock. Acoustics are driven by high frequency pressure fluctuations associated with motor firing or the launch vehicle quickly passing through the atmosphere. This induces responses and stress in structures and components. During launch random vibration from aero-acoustics also induces stresses to hardware (e.g. components, as pieces, move relative to each other) risking failure both due to magnitude and fatigue. xxxxxx vibration, usually (but not always) related to motor chamber pressure resonance during burn, can couple with a component or structure&rsquo;s natural frequency &ndash;magnifying the vibration and posing significant structural and hardware risk. Lastly, short high magnitude shock events also occur at the ignition of each motor stage and at each stage&rsquo;s pyrotechnic separation event. xxxxxx poses significant technical risk and is a common driver for launch vehicle design requirements.xxxxxx to date by the xxxxxx ATK Launch Vehicle Division (LVD) has shown that by infusing CNT into composite we can improve the structural damping by a factor of 2x. xxxxxx damping attenuates launch dynamic environments which leads to cascading benefits if CNT&rsquo;s are infused into all primary and secondary structures. The improved damping lowers transient dynamic loads in primary structures and reduces secondary structure dynamic response. This allows reduction of primary and secondary structural mass. Moreover shock and random vibration are reduced into components which may allow for the elimination of hardware isolation systems. With no isolation required on hundreds of components (including the payload), a significant amount of &ldquo;parasitic mass&rdquo; can be eliminated. The significant reduction in part quantity and design complexity produces cascading material, design, test, and integration cost savings and expedites program schedules. A case study on xxxxxx ATK launch vehicles shows elimination of parasitic mass enabled through CNT utilization could increase payload mass to orbit by &gt;10% and reduce launch vehicle cost by &gt;15%. Dynamic loads and environments into the spacecraft are also decreased&mdash;enabling reduction in payload structural mass, associated propellant mass, and reduce spacecraft test environments.CNT infused launch vehicle structures are at a tipping point enabling breakthrough improvement in structural damping. CNT&rsquo;s efficacy improving damping has been shown at a coupon level in a lab environment (xxxxxx 4). A two phased approach will mature this technology further. xxxxxx I advances xxxxxx to level 5 by building subsystem level prototypes and executing flight-like testing. CNT infused composites will be prototyped and tested in two independent configurations: CNT sheets interstitially layered in pre-impregnated (pre-preg) composite, and chopped CNT&rsquo;s dispersed into composite. xxxxxx advances xxxxxx to level 6 by building full-scale flight structures and completing end to end testing (ground and/or flight tests). xxxxxx structures include a CNT sounding rocket interstage and a palletized CNT lattice bulkhead for a major launch vehicle. xxxxxx ATK is the prime contractor for the xxxxxx Sounding xxxxxx Operations Contract (NSxxxxxx) program. Zero-cost rideshare opportunities to fly the CNT interstage will be pursued on best effort basis through the NSxxxxxx program. xxxxxxults of this two-phased approach will demonstrate the safety, robustness, and cascading benefits of CNT technology in launch vehicles.	16115

Hydrogen-Helium Mixtures: Fundamental Measurements, Neutral Droplet Buoyancy, Evaporation, and Boiling	2018-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxearch groups at xxxxxx (MSFC) and xxxxxx (KSC) have contacted our laboratory in need of experimental measurements for gaseous helium and liquid hydrogen mixtures. These measurements and fundamental property models form the foundation for long-duration propellant modeling, a top technical challenge under TA01 Launch Propulsion xxxxxxs. The objective of this proposal is to establish a working relationship with these groups and provide experimental measurements and basic property models that are necessary to accurately model the interactions between helium and hydrogen that occur in the liquid fuel tanks under launch and in space conditions.xxxxxx hydrogen fuel tanks are pressurized with helium as the tank is emptied due to the fast response and high reliability of the method.  This creates a hydrogen-helium mixture within the fuel tank.  The interaction between liquid hydrogen and gaseous helium in a microgravity system is complex and difficult to model.  Compounding this difficulty is the lack of fundamental property measurements and models of cryogenic helium-hydrogen mixtures that form the basis for predictive model development. Collaboration with researchers at xxxxxx is already underway.  An initial experiment is needed to measure precision PVT-x data of the helium-hydrogen fluid phase envelope. This fundamental property study will be supplemented with measurements of the evaporation, via mass diffusion, of hydrogen droplets in helium.  xxxxxx-hydrogen phase change experiments on typical tank materials are also necessary for model development. xxxxxx of these measurements and models will remain a key barrier to propellant modeling for xxxxxx.I have recently retrofitted a Rubotherm ISOSORP 2000 densimeter for cryogenic service with a vibration isolated cryogenic refrigerator.  The Rubotherm ISOSORP 2000 uses a well established technology to conduct density and sorption measurements of fluids with a high level of accuracy.  The Rubotherm system has been outfitted with a vacuum chamber and cryocooler to achieve temperatures lower than 10 xxxxxx and sorption measurements of hydrogen-helium mixtures can be readily conducted with the existing system.  The evaporation of liquid hydrogen in gaseous helium can be investigated by constructing a simple Pyrex cylinder with copper cooling plates on both ends and observing the droplet evaporation.  The existing system and equipment that is available can be used, or easily modified, to conduct numerous experiments on hydrogen-helium mixtures.  The versatility of this experimental system, and support from this fellowship, will enable a rich collaboration with xxxxxx.	16117

Automated Radiation Measurements for Aviation Safety (ARMAS), Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Commercial aircrew members and frequent flyers face radiation hazards from the effects of cosmic rays and solar energetic particles. During significant solar events, dose rates can exceed safety thresholds. To mitigate the radiation dose rate and total dose hazards, a unique, state-of-the-art system of physics-based models and real-time data characterizing the aviation radiation environment called Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation for Aviation Safety (NAIRAS) is undergoing development. xxxxxxver, validation of the NAIRAS system must occur to provide confidence that accurate nowcasts, and eventually forecasts, can be made for the aviation radiation environment. The Automated Radiation Measurements for Aviation Safety (ARMAS) project will provide that validation in a cost-effective manner. The Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC) radiation detector measures the rate and total quantities of absorbed dose and dose equivalent during aircraft flights. These measurements help estimate the biological risk associated with radiation exposure to humans. Up to three flights of TEPC will be flown during the first half of the performance period. The flight regimes are designed to test a range of representative radiation environments. TEPC results will be analyzed in the second half of the performance period and compared with NAIRAS to validate modeled flight profile results.	16123
Development of High-Performance Ammonia Borane Based Rocket Propellants	2021-08-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx borane based fuels for use in hybrid rocket systems have the potential to be high performing while at the same time mitigating many of the issues associated with conventional liquid fuels (e.g. long term storage, toxicity, low density, etc.). In addition, when used with a hypergolic oxidizer (e.g. white fuming nitric acid), the proposed fuels have the potential for use in systems requiring reliable restart capabilities. The goal of the proposed research is to investigate the behavior and performance of ammonia borane based propellants. While the primary focus of the proposed work would be related to ammonia borane as a potential fuel for hybrid systems, studies investigating its behavior as a fuel additive in solid propellants will be conducted as well.To characterize the burning rate behavior of the proposed hybrid propellants, regression rate analysis will be performed using a conventional opposed flow burner configuration as well as with a custom optically accessible hybrid rocket motor developed at xxxxxx xxxxxxersity. Once the regression rate behavior has been adequately characterized, the information obtained will be used to develop hybrid fuel grains for testing with a conventional hybrid rocket motor. The restart capability diagnostic techniques like planar laser induced fluorescence as well as a novel temperature measurement technique based on phosphor therof the ammonia borane based fuels will be investigated by performing hypergolic ignition experiments on prepared fuel samples. If the ignition delays observed are short enough to prevent \"hard starts\", small scale hybrid motor tests will be performed with nitric acid based oxidizers. For some tests, the oxidizer flow rate will be intentionally interrupted followed by an attempted re-ignition of the motor.To date, there are very few publications in open literature related to the combustion behavior and flame structure of hybrid propellants. As a means of studying both the proposed fuels and hybrid propellants in general, laser mography (currently being developed at xxxxxx xxxxxxersity) will be utilized. Obtaining a more fundamental understanding of these propellants could help inform future fuel formulations and fuel grain designs to further improve the performance of hybrid rocket systems.The In-xxxxxx Propulsion technology roadmap published by xxxxxx (specifically TA 2.1.5.1) lists hybrid propulsion systems as a technology that could enhance a number of different proposed mission types as well as enabling a variety of explorer class missions. xxxxxxed performance of the proposed ammonia borane based fuels meets the technology performance goals listed for hybrid propulsion systems while also having restart capability when used with typical hypergolic oxidizers. In addition, the stable solid state of ammonia borane makes it viable to store long term without the need for cryogenic cooling systems or storage tanks."	16124

Cyclotronic Plasma Actuator with Arc-Magnet for Active Flow Control, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	CU xxxxxx and team partner the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx at Urbana-Champaign propose to develop a new type of plasma-based flow control actuator, which uses a high-voltage electrode that arcs to a cylindrical grounded electrode within a magnetic field. The result is that an arc plasma can be produced, with a Lorentz force that creates a plasma disc (similar concept to a cyclotron). The thought behind this concept is that the thermal actuator authority provided by the plasma arc is coupled with an induced swirl component into a boundary-layer flow, which will enhance mixing and allow flows to remain attached across strong adverse pressure gradients. Effectively, the proposed actuator would function like vortex generators that one can actively enable or disable on command.  This subsystem demonstration will pioneer a family of devices to address a notoriously difficult problem in active flow control.  The new capabilities in aerodynamic performance enabled by this innovative actuation approach will be demonstrated in both ground and flight tests.  CU xxxxxx will design, fabricate, and deliver a flight-ready demonstration plasma actuator to xxxxxx at the end of the xxxxxx program.	16128
Multipurpose Waste Disposal Bags for Heat Melt Compactor Application, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	Trash bags from xxxxxx (xxxxxx) are currently stored on-board until they are returned to earth for disposal. xxxxxxernate methods are seriously being considered for long duration missions such as travel to xxxxxx and xxxxxx. xxxxxx Exploration Life Support system is currently developing an xxxxxx (HMC) for waste management for long duration missions. Using HMC, trash can be compacted into disks instead of allowing the trash-filled containers to occupy valuable space in the spacecraft.  Such compacted trash can potentially be useful as radiation shields. In order to assist the HMC process, MMI will develop a multipurpose trash bag that will be capable of storing waste generated during travel in space.  The waste bag will allow water vapor to pass through during hot melt compactor processing. The bag will also enable encapsulation of the compacted product and will be amenable for sterile storage. In the xxxxxx I effort, waste container bags will be tested for containment of simulated trash typically used on a space mission. The waste container bag material will be tested for removal of water from the bag during the hot melt compaction process. After removal of water, the dehydrated solid compacts will be tested for the prevention of harmful microbial growth.  In the xxxxxx effort, the waste bag material design and volume will be optimized to fit the xxxxxx hot melt compactor systems that will be used in long duration travels in space.	16129
Wide Throttling, High Throughput Hall Thruster for Science and Exploration Missions, Phase II	2015-03-01	2018-07-19	"In response to Topic S3.04 \"Propulsion xxxxxxs,\" xxxxxx Co. xxxxxx. will develop a high throughput xxxxxx effect thruster with a nominal peak power of 1-kW and wide throttling range in terms of both power and xxxxxx.  In xxxxxx I the preliminary thruster design was completed.  Project activities focused on achieving a magnetic field that shields the discharge channel from ion induced erosion.  The goal is to achieve a propellant throughput greater than 100 kg/kW.  Numerical modeling is playing a critical role in the thruster design.  In xxxxxx I, we used a fluid based code developed by JPL to model the plasma in an existing thruster that is currently undergoing life testing.  The erosion predictions of the model were found to agree well with actual measurements.  The numerical model was then applied to the magnetically shielded 1-kW thruster and preliminary results were found to be reasonable.  The goal is to demonstrate a thruster design where channel erosion is entirely eliminated as a life limiting mechanism.In xxxxxx, we will build and test the extended lifetime thruster.  The performance, lifetime, and plume properties of the thruster will then be evaluated, and the design will be optimized.  Numerical modeling will be used throughout the process to ensure that magnetic shielding is achieved.  Code predictions will be grounded in plasma measurements taken with a variety of diagnostics including channel wall probes, high speed intrusive channel probes, and plume probes.  The ability of the thruster to achieve its lifetime goals will be assessed through a 500 hour wear test.  When the design is finalized, an engineering development unit (EDU) thruster will be designed, built, validated, and delivered to xxxxxx.  The EDU thruster design will be modeled thermally and structurally to facilitate the transition to xxxxxx.  At the end of the xxxxxx, the xxxxxx will be 5/6."	16130
Roll-Out De-Orbiting Device, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx intends to place small spacecraft (<100kg) and very small spacecraft (<15kg) into a variety of orbits.  xxxxxx and technologies are needed to intentionally de-orbit these spacecraft at end of mission, or upon loss of control and function.  CTD has developed a family of highly mass efficient Roll-Out De-Orbiting devices (RODEO).  RODEO provides a dramatic increase in the deployed surface area, resulting in higher aerodynamic drag and significantly reduced time until satellite re-entry.  RODEO's composite booms self-deploy with no external spacecraft power, and the inherent simplicity of RODEO results in extremely low costs, low mass, and low power.	16131
Toward Reducing Crew Time and Conserving Resources: Superhydrophillic Treatment of Hardware in Crew Hygiene Areas, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	Significant challenges remain for the designers of life support equipment for spacecraft&#151;primarily for the processing of aqueous fluids: oxygen supply, air revitalization, thermal management systems, water reclamation, medical fluids, and others. The main problem is that failure-prone processes are often employed to overcome unfamiliar microgravity fluidic phenomena using artificial buoyancy-inducing methods. The most obvious example is a mechanical centrifuge for liquid-gas separations aboard orbiting spacecraft. To improve xxxxxx spacecraft fluid systems design, xxxxxxoxxxxxx LLC (ISL) proposes to develop Superhydrophilic Coatings for Embedded xxxxxxillary xxxxxxs (SPHIL-EMCAP) with xxxxxxmicrobial properties. In xxxxxx I, ISL will design and fabricate a complex capillary solution for spacecraft fluid management. The geometric design will exploit the current state of the art in analytical and computational capillary fluidics. Devices will be coated with SPHIL-EMCAP and evaluated for substrate adhesion, water contact angles, wear, and environment robustness, before testing in the relevant low-g environment to assess the improved capillary control afforded by the superhydrophilic coatings. In xxxxxx, ISL will downselect materials and applications, and optimize SPHIL-EMCAP's performance by refining the prototyping process and optimizing the superhydrophilic coating formulation.

Distributed Visualization	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	Distributed xxxxxxization allows anyone, anywhere, to see any simulation, at any time. xxxxxxment focuses on algorithms, software, data formats, data systems and processes to enable sharing simulation-based information across temporal and spatial boundaries without requiring stakeholders to possess highly-specialized and very expensive display systems. It also introduces abstraction between the native and shared data. &nbsp;This allows teams to share results without giving away proprietary or sensitive data. The initial implementation of this capability is the Distributed xxxxxx xxxxxx (DON) version 3.1. DON 3.1 is available for public release in the xxxxxx Software xxxxxx (xxxx) and works with version 3.0 of the xxxxxx xxxxxxess Control specification (an XML Simulation xxxxxx Representation and Communication xxxxxxuage) to display complex graphical information and associated Meta-xxxxxx. &nbsp;&nbsp; As xxxxxx&#39;s teams grow increasingly diverse and even more dispersed, new means of sharing data and experiences among team members are required. &nbsp;Collaboration must occur across teams in different geographic locations, different time zones and, in the case of missions on the distant horizon, different generations. Each team brings a different gift to the table. &nbsp;They have different expertise and use different tools to meet their goals, yet they must all somehow come together to achieve a single vision. &nbsp;Distributed xxxxxxization strives to unify teams and technologies by providing a common mechanism for sharing and integrating pertinent data. To accomplish this task, algorithms, software, data formats, data systems, and process are examined to identify and implement those which will best enable the sharing and integration of simulation-based information across temporal and spatial boundaries. To date, demonstrated work in Distributed xxxxxxization has dealt with physics-based simulations and utilized a variety of graphics engines and toolkits. &nbsp;In addition to the application of these technologies, significant effort has been expended to define data elements, identify process commonality among simulation teams, establish interfaces, and evolve data standards. &nbsp;The result of the data standard work has been collected and published as the xxxxxx xxxxxxess Control (xxxxxx) xxxxxx and documented for public use.

Currently, load optimization is accomplished through geometric methods assuming monolithic material properties. This new approach will allow alloy composition to be continuously varied in a controlled manner such that chemistry, and thus properties, can also be in the design optimization path.

Wireless Multiplexed Surface Acoustic Wave Sensors	2013-09-01	2018-07-19	Wireless xxxxxx (SAW) xxxxxx is a new technology for obtaining multiple, real-time measurements under extreme environmental conditions. The objective for this project is to develop a wireless multiplexed sensor system that uses SAW sensors, with no batteries or semiconductors, that are passive and rugged, can operate down to cryogenic temperatures and up to hundreds of degrees xxxxxx, and can be used to sense a wide variety of parameters over reasonable distances (meters). This work continues the development of a novel wireless, passive, sensing system that uses surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors. During this effort a new multiplexing concept, coherence multiplexing, was developed and an operational system was constructed and tested.

High Power, Thermally Optimized Blue Laser for Lidar, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	To enable widespread and rapid airborne bathymetric lidar to adequate depths in many ocean regions a low-cost, rugged, and high energy pulsed laser source must be developed in the ocean water transmittance spectrum of 450 - 490 nm. The ideal laser source will be high performance for lidar (high pulse energy, high rep rate, short pulse duration) with specific targeted emission spectrum to meet ocean water transmittance and filtering requirements.  It will also feature low SWaP and a rugged form factor with high reliability for continual use on mobile platforms.  No existing laser source can meet these demanding requirements.To address this challenge and meet xxxxxx lidar source needs, xxxxxx Photonics, xxxxxx. (xxxxxx) proposes creating a high power Q-switched, off-line xxxxxxYAG source at 946 nm, which, when frequency doubled to 473 nm, will provide high transmittance through ocean waters.  xxxxxx's design will leverage three key innovations: efficient, end-pumped, low-quantum-defect architecture; gain crystal design for optimal heat removal; and robust monolithic, alignment-free fabrication. The proposed design would allow for widespread deployment of mobile ocean-penetrating lidar transmitters.  xxxxxx's overall goal for this xxxxxx I effort is construct a breadboard prototype laser emitting 10 WAVG at 473 nm with a viable pathway to a rugged, turn-key system with >10% wall-plug efficiency to be built and delivered in a xxxxxx effort.  xxxxxx has modeled and constructed similar lasers on xxxxxx I xxxxxx efforts previously and will apply the innovations developed there towards this new system for xxxxxx.	16140

High Efficiency Microchannel Diamond Heat Sinks, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	While absolute power levels in microelectronic devices are relatively modest (a few tens to a few hundred watts), heat fluxes can be significant (~50 W/cm2 in current electronic chips; up to 2000 W/cm2 in semiconductor lasers).  xxxxxx diamond heat sinks created via microfabrication techniques make it possible to boost heat transfer rates well above what is possible with ordinary cooling devices. If  nanodiamond particles are added in suspension to the circulating fluid in the microchannels, the heat carrying properties of the device would be increased even more. The devices we are proposing to fabricate would utilize diamond which has the highest thermal conductivity of any known material combined with a microchannel cooling system. These unique attributes would make microchannel diamond heat sinks prime contenders for the next generation heat sink. These devices could be utilized for efficient cooling in a variety of applications requiring high heat transfer capability including: semiconductor lasers, multichip modules in computers laser-diode arrays, radar systems, high-flux optics, etc. An added benefit for outer space applications is that besides having the highest known thermal conductivity, diamond is the best shielding material for micrometeorite protection.	16142

Electronic Correlated Noise Calibration Standard for Interferometric and Polarimetric Microwave Radiometers, Phase II	2007-01-01	2018-07-19	A new type of calibration standard is proposed which produces a pair of microwave noise signals to aid in the characterization and calibration of correlating radiometers. The proposed Correlated Noise xxxxxx xxxxxx (CNCS) is able to generate pairs of broad bandwidth stochastic noise signals with a wide variety of statistical properties. The CNCS can be used with synthetic aperture interferometers to generate specific visibility functions. It can be used with fully polarimetric radiometers to generate specific 3rd and 4th xxxxxx parameters of brightness temperature. It can also be used with spectrometers to generate specific power spectra and autocorrelations. It is possible to combine these features and, for example, generate the pair of signals that would be measured by a fully polarimetric, spectrally resolving, synthetic aperture radiometer at a particular pair of polarizations and antenna baselines for a specified scene over a specified frequency band.  The proposed CNCS will cover all the frequencies used for radiometric observations in the 1 to 40 GHz range. In specific, the xxxxxx project will develop the system prototypes for L and X bands. While intended for ground based characterization of radiometer systems, the technological approach is amenable to on-orbit calibration.	16145

High Response Control Valve, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	WASK xxxxxxing proposes to adapt the design of an existing piezo actuated valve that has demonstrated the ability to open within 0.5 msec, operate for more than 2x109 cycles while maintaining a leakage rate of less than 1x10-3 sccm of He.  The valve is less than 3.5 inches long with a maximum width of 1 inch. It has been sized to flow 0.27 lbs/sec of LOX, sufficient to support either the LOX and xxxxxx flow rates of a 100 lbf thruster. A piezo actuated valve has many benefits for RCS thrusters. The speed with which the valve can adjust its throttle position means that with two such valves the thruster propellant mixture ratio can be rapidly adjusted to prevent hardware damage. The valves have the ability to continuously throttle over a range of thrust levels, allowing the thruster to operate from zero to full thrust.  The piezo crystals use very little power, reducing the overall power consumption, again reducing weight.	16147
Silicon-Carbide (SIC) Multichip Power Modules (MCPMS) For Power Building Block Applications, Phase II	2007-12-01	2018-07-19	In xxxxxx I, APEI, xxxxxx. proved the feasibility of developing a modular, expandable and fault tolerant xxxxxx-based power system through the successful demonstration of a four-module xxxxxx-based power system capable of dynamic reconfiguration allowing the system to continue delivering power to the load without interruption in the event of a module failure.  These results show the feasibility of developing miniaturized xxxxxx multichip power modules (MCPMs) to form a core power building block component.  The MCPM building blocks utilize a distributed control and communications structure, with a communications network established between the core silicon-on-insulator (SOI) controllers of the MCPMs, but with no single controller in command of the system. The decentralized control and modular approach allow for the construction of highly flexible, auto-configurable, stackable power systems to be connected in series and/or parallel to increase overall system power handling capabilities. Moreover, the identical core MCPM building blocks could be used in many power electronics applications, while various specific functions such as source regulation, energy storage regulation, and motor drives could be achieved by the use of external components.  In addition, the development of high-temperature MCPMs allows high levels of miniaturization, power density, and efficiency resulting in highly reliable, compact, modular, and inexpensive power systems.	16148

Comfortable and Durable Clothing Ensemble with Flame-Resistant Properties, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx is now concerned with maintaining, validating, and improving fire safety on the xxxxxx throughout its lifetime while providing maximum flexibility in the types of experiments and operations that can be conducted by the crew members. Thus, more comfortable, durable and flexible flame retardant crew clothing is required, especially during long term missions. Current cotton clothing is highly flammable and not suitable for fire fighting. There is urgent need to develop non-flammable alternatives for shirts, shorts, sweaters, and jackets without compromising the comfort and flexibility. This xxxxxx I project aims to develop flame retardant textiles using a new class of chemicals called polyoxometalates (POMs).  We have devised methods to anchor this class of compound to a variety of conventional (cotton based) fabrics. The overall goal is to take existing fabrics, with their desirable physical properties and high level of comfort, and add a flame retardant capability. The functionalized textile material will have thermal stability, reduction in smoke generation and flammability, reasonable cost, no skin and environmental toxicity, and permanence while retaining the desired properties of the starting material.  Our novel flame resistant textile material will withstand harsh conditions without leaching of the agents.	16150

Assessment and Risk Mitigation Strategies for the Atom InterferometerGravity Gradiometer Seed Lasers	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx GSFC has been working on an ESTO IIP - Cold Atom Gravity  Gradiometer (CAGG)/Atom Interferometer Gravity Gradiometer (AIGG) for  xxxxxx since 2014 (Saif/551 – PI).  Significant progress has been  made in the AIGG instrument development and demonstrated performance,  but the xxxxxx of the instrument remains at ~4.   Our main objective for  this IRAD is to initiate a detailed assessment of the master  oscillator used in the AIGG instrument, which builds upon the  extensive data we collected on these lasers from the FY16 and FY17  IRAD efforts. The master oscillators (MO) used in the current AIGG instrument being  built by AOxxxxxx are (1) Distributed xxxxxx Reflector (DBR) laser from  xxxxxx and (2) the external cavity diode laser (ECDL) from  AOxxxxxx.  During the development effort at AOxxxxxx, several of the DBR  lasers from xxxxxx suffered early failure.  The xxxxxx DBR  lasers have rated output powers in the 240 mW range and most of them  were operating at output power of 190 mW (approximately 20%  derating).  On the contrary, we have several xxxxxx DBR lasers in  house that we operated in our life test stations during the FY16 and  FY17 IRAD efforts and have not seen any degradation after more than  2900 hours of total operating time.   xxxxxxhough ours were rated at half  the output power, at 120 mW and we operated them at a derated power of  ~90mW for the lifetest.  These DBR lasers were used to seed the tapered amplifiers (TA) in the  life test station.  We continued to use the same DBR lasers in our  FY17 lifetest of the TA’s.  The total operating time is currently  &gt;2900 hours, and these DBR lasers continued to operate nominally  without any signs of degradation.Given the differences between the failures observed at AOxxxxxx and  our in-house effort, we believe it is critical to investigate the  mechanisms that could lead to earlier failure and provide a viable  path forward to mitigate this risk.  One of the concerns with using  the DBR lasers at a derated level is the linewidth and frequency noise  characteristics of these DBR lasers will vary as a function of  operating current.We have collected preliminary data showing the xxxxxx DBR laser  power spectral density (PSD) as function of operating current.  When  the DBR laser is operated at 75 mA it has more noise compared to the  same laser operating at higher current (130 mA and 170 mA).   It is  our goals in this proposed effort to investigate and assess the  performance of the DBR lasers and make recommendations on the laser  operating conditions to minimize the failures observed by AOxxxxxx. One of the more stringent requirements on the master oscillator in  the AIGG instrument is the output power.   If the DBR laser needs to  be derated to improve lifetime, then one option is to boost the output  power using a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA).  This is  especially true in case the MO used is the ECDL from AOxxxxxx, which  has a nominal output power of ~40 mW.  The addition of the SOA is a  straightforward approach to boost the optical power, but this also  could increase the noise of the output signal.  We propose to  investigate the effect of the SOA on the master oscillator spectral  quality and recommendation to the AIGG instrument team the best  approach to improve lifetime without sacrificing the spectral quality  that could affect overall science objectives. 	16153
Robotic Mission Simulation Tool, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx Technologies proposes a software tool to predict robotic mission performance and support supervision of robotic missions even when environments and situations are profoundly unknown. It transcends common xxxxxx simulations by supporting input parameters for which probability distributions are not available. Stochastic optimization is combined with randomized simulation to bound statistical measures of performance and convey the parameters giving the extreme scenarios.  It also provides 3D immersive presentation of those scenarios. The act of performing multiple simulation runs in real time is enabled by the fast simulation capability provided by xxxxxx Technologies' existing software combined with the development of new algorithms and software. The new algorithms cover path planning, scene rendering, sensor modeling, and robot-terrain interaction modeling.  In the new software, automatic path planning is calculated using a combination of static and dynamic techniques.  Scene rendering for sensor modeling is implemented using fast ray tracing for low-update-rate sensors and ray-tracing-validated rasterization for fast-update-rate sensors.  Robot-terrain interaction is calculated through particle simulations implemented on graphics cards.  For maximum performance, the new software allows distribution of randomized simulation runs over multiple networked PCs and cloud-based clusters.  This combination of fast algorithms and statistical optimization offers a tool that provides new engineering insights and data. The software will be demonstrated on the example mission of searching for ice near near the southern lunar pole, giving evidence of the ability of the tool to support challenging relevant missions.	16154
Evaluating Prognostics Performance for Algorithms Incorporating Uncertainty Estimates	2013-07-29	2018-07-19	Uncertainty Representation and Management (URM) are an integral part of the prognostic system development.1As capabilities of prediction algorithms evolve, research in developing newer and more competent methods for URM is gaining momentum.2Beyond initial concepts, more sophisticated prediction distributions are obtained that are not limited to assumptions of Normality and unimodal characteristics. Most prediction algorithms yield non-parametric distributions that are then approximated as known ones for analytical simplicity, especially for performance assessment methods. xxxxxxhough applying the prognostic metrics introduced earlier with their simple definitions has proven useful, a lot of information about the distributions gets thrown away. In this paper, several techniques have been suggested for incorporating information available from Remaining Useful Life (RUL) distributions, while applying the prognostic performance metrics. These approaches offer a convenient and intuitive visualization of algorithm performance with respect to metrics like prediction horizon and α-λ performance, and also quantify the corresponding performance while incorporating the uncertainty information. A variety of options have been shortlisted that could be employed depending on whether the distributions can be approximated to some known form or cannot be parameterized. This paper presents a qualitative analysis on how and when these techniques should be used along with a quantitative comparison on a real application scenario. A particle filter based prognostic framework has been chosen as the candidate algorithm on which to evaluate the performance metrics due to its unique advantages in uncertainty management and flexibility in accommodating non-linear models and xxxxxx noise. We investigate how performance estimates get affected by choosing different options of integrating the uncertainty estimates. This allows us to identify the advantages and limitations of these techniques and their applicability towards a standardized performance evaluation method.	16155

Specifically, an area of importance in relation to in situ sensors and sensor systems is instrument deployment on a variety of space platforms, which include orbiters, flyby spacecraft, landers, rovers, balloon, other aerial vehicles, subsurface penetrators, and impactors.  These instrumentation and space platforms are to be used in the exploration of inner and outer planets and their moons, comets, asteroids, etc.  As a direct consequence, the instrumentation systems are subjected to space and planetary environmental extremes including temperature, pressure, radiation, and impact stresses during operation.

Advanced Modeling of Ramp Operations including Departure Status at Secondary Airports, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	This project addresses three modeling elements relevant to xxxxxx IADS research and ATD-2 project, two related to ramp operations at primary airports and one related to departure status at secondary airports.  Departure scheduling requires departure status information from secondary airports that lack surface surveillance.  We propose a method using aircraft transponder activation and data science modeling to estimate earliest takeoff time and runway.  Fast-time simulations of IADS concepts require models of how ramp controllers manage near-gate aircraft movements; and how flight operators will interact with collaborative departure scheduling concepts.  We propose to develop a model, with defined interfaces to be usable in any xxxxxx simulation platform, for conflict/congestion-free aircraft movements in alleyways, coordinated to allow efficient, simultaneous movements.  We will also offer a model for flight operator's swapping gate delays to free needed gates and prioritize their schedules.  These models are also relevant to xxxxxx xxxxxxDA and SMART NAS projects.  We will document the model designs, deliver all source code, and, in xxxxxx 2, publish models under and xxxxxx license.	16159

The system will include a graphical user interface that provides easy access to symbolic and numerical computing tools that support aircraft modeling, nonlinear dynamic analysis and control analysis; sophisticated data base management; and visualization. We also propose and will implement an innovative methodology and associated computer tools for analysis and control synthesis in the context of upset prevention and recovery for unimpaired and impaired aircraft. Our approach will address: aerodynamic modeling of aircraft operating outside of the normal flight envelope, multi-mode operation of aircraft, automated assembly of analytical and simulation models -- including real time models, analytical methods and tools for identifying conditions for departure from controlled flight and identification of 'safe' operating states, and analytical methods and tools for identifying the set of recoverable states and associated recovery strategies.

Ultra-Light “Photonic Muscle” Space Structures	2012-09-01	2018-07-19	Fabrication of large space optics that are accurately shaped to better than a 1,000th of the width of a human hair is an enormous challenge. Traditional space telescope fabrication methods require rigid and therefore heavy mirrors, expensive spacecraft and massive rocket launch vehicles. This breakthrough technology allows every molecule of a polymer substrate to also serve as a laser powered nano-actuator. These molecules are used to control the shape of a super thin inexpensive large curved mirror, reducing cost and mass by a factor of 100. The NIAC telescope OCCAM mirror will be less dense than a feather.	16167
Divergent Field Annular Ion Engine, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The proposed work investigates an approach that would allow an annular ion engine geometry to achieve ion beam currents approaching xxxxxx limit.  In this respect, the annular engine, whose design inherently allows for significant increases in perveance by resolving the span-to-gap problem, can achieve the projected high current densities necessary for high thrust, high power applications. The case for high power gridded ion thrusters is compelling if not only for risk reduction in contrast to lower xxxxxx xxxxxx thruster variants such as the nested channel systems. This point cannot be over emphasized as there is now significant effort and resources applied to xxxxxx engine development.  Yet there still remains some uncertainty as to how high power variants or magnetically insulated variants will actually perform in space. Interpretation of high power xxxxxx engine operation in ground test facilities is also not completely well understood.  This is in contrast with gridded ion technology whose facility corrections are well understood.  The current investment in high power gridded ion thruster technology is minimal.  This effort seeks to address this gap in technology development and in the process continue the advancement of a credible risk reducing technology for high power mission applications.	16168
Data Mining in Systems Health Management	2013-03-20	2018-07-19	This chapter presents theoretical and practical aspects associated to the implementation of a combined model-based/data-driven approach for failure prognostics based on particle filtering algorithms, in which the current esti- mate of the state PDF is used to determine the operating condition of the system and predict the progression of a fault indicator, given a dynamic state model and a set of process measurements. In this approach, the task of es- timating the current value of the fault indicator, as well as other important changing parameters in the environment, involves two basic steps: the predic- tion step, based on the process model, and an update step, which incorporates the new measurement into the a priori state estimate.This framework allows to estimate of the probability of failure at future time instants (RUL PDF) in real-time, providing information about time-to- failure (TTF) expectations, statistical confidence intervals, long-term predic- tions; using for this purpose empirical knowledge about critical conditions for the system (also referred to as the hazard zones). This information is of paramount significance for the improvement of the system reliability and cost-effective operation of critical assets, as it has been shown in a case study where feedback correction strategies (based on uncertainty measures) have been implemented to lengthen the RUL of a rotorcraft transmission system with propagating fatigue cracks on a critical component. xxxxxxhough the feed- back loop is implemented using simple linear relationships, it is helpful to provide a quick insight into the manner that the system reacts to changes on its input signals, in terms of its predicted RUL. The method is able to manage xxxxxx since it includes concepts such as nonlinear state estimation and confidence intervals in its formulation.Real data from a fault seeded test showed that the proposed framework was able to anticipate modifications on the system input to lengthen its RUL. xxxxxxults of this test indicate that the method was able to successfully suggest the correction that the system required. In this sense, future work will be focused on the development and testing of similar strategies using different input-output uncertainty metrics.	16169
Real-Time Range Sensing Video Camera for Human/Robot Interfacing, Phase I	2005-01-01	2018-07-19	In comparison to stereovision, it is well known that structured-light illumination has distinct advantages including the use of only one camera, being significantly less sensitive to background clutter, and not requiring the target object to have nonambiguous features. But because structured-light illumination requires a scanning process, it is inappropriate for humancomputer interfacing where the movements/gestures of a human subject are of interest. We propose the innovative process of composite pattern design as a means of constructing structured-light illumination patterns that measure surface topologies with only a single image and, thereby, are appropriate for recording real-time depth video. By moving the composite pattern into the Near-Infra-Red wavelength light spectrum and coupling with real-time optical processor, we intend to establish feasibility of a real-time, low latency, ambient light resistant, and high accuracy depth video sensor for producing a depth map of a scene applicable to virtual reality interfaces that permit control of robotic systems through human gestures by way of spatial tracking of user appendages in motion absent any wearable transmitters or markers.	16170
Electrochemical Detection of Biological Catalysts as Signatures of Life	2017-07-01	2018-07-19	The enzyme trypsin is chosen as a detection target due to its ubiquity in Earth biology. xxxxxx catalyzes the break down of proteins through a catalytic triad consisting of histidine, aspartate and serine. The proposed sensor works by the detection of proteolytic cleavage of a redox-active tag. It is comprised of two gold electrodes. The first gold electrode houses a sensor probe, in this case a substrate peptide. The second electrode is a collector electrode that will detect the product of peptide cleavage. A methylene-labeled substrate peptide is self-assembled on a gold electrode using a thiol linkage. Any remaining accessible area of the electrode is then “blocked” or backfilled with an alkanethiol, which acts as an insulator and forces the peptide to stand up and form a close-packed structure on the gold surface. In this close-packed configuration, the peptide is accessible to the catalytic reaction with trypsin. xxxxxx cleaves the peptide and releases the methylene blue terminus. A characteristic redox signature of methylene blue is detected at the second electrode using cyclic voltammetry and/or square wave voltammetry. xxxxxxdes will be fabricated as 2 gold band electrodes on an inert substrate using a shadow mask and gold evaporation. While not required for proof of concept sensing, a simple fluidic channel will be added over the electrodes to demonstrate future integration ease with the ARC xxxxxxersal Sample xxxxxxessor for Life on Icy Worlds (SPLIce).	16171
Multicamera High Dynamic Range High-Speed Video of Rocket Engine Tests and Launches	2016-03-01	2018-07-19	High-speed video recording of rocket engine tests has several challenges. The scenes that are imaged have both bright and dark regions associated with plume emission (bright) and solid bodies (dark and bright) that are visible because light from other sources reflects off them. Recent advances in High Dynamic xxxxxx (HDR) technologies can address the challenges of acquiring high-quality rocket engine test imagery in a convenient, safe and effective manner. This project extends techniques developed in a previous project to develop a high-speed, color, extreme HDR video imaging capability with four boresighted HD video cameras appropriate for imaging targets several to many meters from the camera system.High-speed video cameras do not have sufficient dynamic range to properly expose both bright and dark regions that occur during rocket engine testing without partial saturation due to the limited bits (typically 8-10) available. HDR imaging is a technique that uses two or more exposures of the same scene combined with processing to fuse the different exposures into a single image that can display the entire dynamic range of the scene. For this project a prototype multicamera HDR imaging system was designed and constructed, and included a custom camera mount. The cameras were integrated into a imaging platform, camera calibration was performed, and a custom software workflow to fuse raw Bayer array imagery into color HDR imagery was developed. The technique was successfully used on a Hybrid Desktop Demonstration xxxxxx and other targets of opportunity.A high-speed, color, extreme HDR video imaging capability that can be used to monitor high energy engine tests from distances up to many meters away was developed. HDR imaging is a technique that uses two or more exposures of the same scene that, combined with processing, fuses the different exposures into a single image that can display the entire dynamic range of the scene without saturation. This project combined multiple streams of HD video using computational photography and computer vision techniques to produce a cutting edge, color, extreme HDR recording capability.	16172
Hybrid Prediction Method for Aircraft Interior Noise, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	This proposal discusses the development and application of new methods of structural-acoustic analysis in order to address existing problems in aircraft interior noise prediction.  The proposed methods are based on a hybrid modeling strategy that combines Finite Element xxxxxx (FEA) and Statistical Energy xxxxxx (SEA).  Over the past five years, Vibro-Acoustic xxxxxxs has devoted a considerable research effort towards the development of a framework for combining these two analysis methods.  Recent research carried out by over the past two years has resulted in the development of a rigorous solution to this problem.  The resulting Hybrid approach has been derived in general terms and validated for a number of simple structural-acoustic problems.  xxxxxxver, the method has not yet been applied to aircraft interior noise prediction.  A number of candidate aircraft interior noise problems have been identified which would benefit greatly from the use of the Hybrid method.  The aims of the research described in this proposal are therefore: (i) to demonstrate the application of the Hybrid method to a number of existing aircraft interior noise problems, (ii) to develop the method to ensure it contains sufficient functionality to address practical aircraft interior noise problems and (iii) to demonstrate the value of the method in the prediction and reduction of noise in airframe systems.	16173
LMM Holographic Optical Tweezers (HOT) Module, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	We propose to expand the capabilities of the LMM for colloidal and other research by developing a holographic optical tweezers (HOT) module, allowing solid-state software-controlled micromanipulation with no moving parts.A HOT device produces hundreds of independently-steerable and independently-focusable beams, as well as other arbitrarily-complex 3D illumination patterns. HOT is useful for colloidal research, with the ability to precisely position collections of particles within colloids, and to use optically-trapped particles to measure linear and nonlinear viscoelastic properties of fluids. Each HOT beam can be a traditional trapping beam, or can impart rotational angular momentum to particles via Bessel beam profiles. HOT systems are also used in biological research, for example in measuring the mobility and deformability of cells (a measure of cellular health, and an indicator of damage), and in rotating or sorting individual cells.All of these capabilities are possible using the same hardware, with beam configuration, power, and motion controlled entirely by software and voltage applied to a motionless solid-state device. Due to its built-in adaptive optics capability, a HOT system can also diagnose and correct for its own alignment errors. The ability to remotely add, upgrade, or repair capabilities via software alone makes holographic micromanipulation a core capability for xxxxxx research.BNS proposes to develop a HOT module for the LMM, capitalizing on our previous experience in developing a commercially-available standalone HOT microscope, our current efforts toward developing a multibeam holographic photostimulation module for commercial microscopes, and on our widely-used, flight-tested spatial light modulators (SLMs).	16174
Highly Flexible and Extremely Durable Polyimide Cryogenic Insulation, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	The proposed innovative insulation would greatly enhance the usability of, and reduce the inherent losses associated with, cryogenic fuel delivery and storage apparatus. The proposed insulation has been tested to yield a thermal conductivity value of 0.019w/mK @ one inch format @ an areal density <1pcf. In addition, the ability of the proposed insulation to remain highly flexible at extreme cryogenic temperatures for extended periods of time is unique. xxxxxx done by KSC on early forms of this material proved its ability to remain flexible in continuous cryogenic applications in outside environments.  xxxxxxver, degradation of the foam was observed over extended periods. In this xxxxxx I, GFT proposes to test the hypothesis that it can significantly improve the earlier material's long-term durability through altered synthesis and imidization processes.	16175

In this xxxxxx STTR, CFDRC and its partner xxxxxx State xxxxxxersity will develop an innovative, comprehensive, high fidelity radiation module in the LOCI CFD framework that will enable xxxxxx to design/analyze heat transfer challenges that include radiation.  In xxxxxx I, CFDRC/MSU successfully demonstrated the feasibility of developing a radiation module in LOCI-Chem.  A preliminary module was developed that included a gray gas model, as well as simplified nongray gas and particulate radiation capabilities.  Following successful implementation and validation, LOCI-Chem with the radiation module was successfully applied to a xxxxxx xxxxxx Motor (SRM) plume on a launch pad as a demonstration case.

Perfectly Impedance-Matched Negative Index High Temperature Selective Emission Films for Thermophotovoltaics, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	"Thermophotovoltaic(TPV) energy conversion produces electrical power from heat energy in a simple, low maintenance manner ideal for certain xxxxxx applications. Currently, thermophotovoltaics suffer from low efficiencies, where only a small fraction of the total thermal energy is converted to electrical energy. One key to improving efficiency is to match the emitter spectrum more precisely to the conversion characteristics, using engineered metamaterial emitters. Metamaterials have shown great promise as efficient narrow-band selective emitters that can provide the improved spectral match between emitter and converter. To address the opportunity afforded by a novel metamaterials-based TPV emitter film, xxxxxxhmics xxxxxx. and Dr. xxxxxx at The xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx at xxxxxx propose to develop the TAloNTM Emitter, a high-temperature,  ultra-thin thermal emitter of infrared radiation for TPVs. Despite its simplicity and amenability to straightforward fabrication, our design encompasses all the advantages mentioned above: extremely highly selective emission, tunability of emission frequency, sub-wavelength size, and large field enhancement inside the metamaterial. xxxxxx will be constructed using the highly scalable process of \"roll-to-roll\" deposition and nanoimprint lithography using highly thermally stable materials such as tungsten and aluminum nitride."	16186

Achromatic Vector Vortex Waveplates for Coronagraphy, Phase II	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	Using small aperture telescopes for detecting exoplanets could have a significant impact on astronomy and other imaging and space communication systems. In this new generation of smaller, lighter and more affordable coronagraph systems, the starlight is rejected with the aid of phase-based transparent masks capable of transmitting planetary light at small angular separation from the star. These so-called vector vortex waveplates (VVW) are complex optical components wherein the optical axis orientation is azimuthally modulated in space at a high spatial frequency. In the xxxxxx of the project, we showed the feasibility of fabricating VVWs that would meet requirements for astronomy applications due to small singularity size, high topological charge, high contrast, and broadband functionality. The breakthrough polarization conversion and beam shaping technology of printing VVWs developed in the xxxxxx will undergo further fundamental improvements in the xxxxxx 2 of the project along with further optimization of photoalignment materials and liquid crystal polymers to fabricate and deliver VVWs characterized by: subwavelength singularity sizes; spectrally broadband/achromatic functionality, particularly, for infrared wavelengths; stability to radiation and large temperature variations; and functionality at cryogenic temperatures. This will accomplish the project's general objective &#150; development and delivery of VVWs adequate for practical use.	16189

LF  is dedicated to locating water ice in the permanently shadowed regions  of the lunar south pole by measuring surface reflectance at multiple  wavelengths. LF will be one of the first cubesats performing science  measurements beyond low Earth orbit and the first planetary mission to  use multi-band active reflectometry from orbit.The xxxxxx (LF) mission is a xxxxxx 6U (6 xxxxxxs of  approximately 10×10×10 cm each) cubesat mission dedicated to mapping  water ice in the permanently shadowed regions within 10° latitude of  the lunar south pole.

A Low-Power Medical Oxygen Generator, Phase II	2017-11-01	2018-07-19	An on-board oxygen concentrator is required during long duration manned space missions to supply medical oxygen.  The commercial medical oxygen generators based on pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are large and highly power intensive.  TDA xxxxxxearch, xxxxxx. (TDA) proposes to develop a small, lightweight, portable oxygen generator based on a vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) to produce concentrated medical oxygen.  The unit uses ambient vehicle cabin air as the feed and delivers high purity oxygen while meeting xxxxxx requirements for high flow capacity, closed-loop tissue oxygen control and operation in microgravity/partial gravity.  TDA's VSA system uses a modified version of the lithium exchanged low silica X zeolite (Li-LSX), a state-of-the-art air separation sorbent extensively used in commercial Portable xxxxxx Concentrators (POCs) to enhance the N2 adsorption capacity. In xxxxxx I, we demonstrated the scientific, technical, and commercial feasibility of the oxygen concentrator module (OCM).  In  xxxxxx, we will develop a higher fidelity prototype with an adjustable pressure output to produce 2-15 lpm of O2 at 50% to +90% purity from ambient cabin air.  The OCM will be capable of self-regulating the oxygenation of the patient using a closed loop feedback system that senses tissue oxygenation level. We will evaluate the sorbent performance in a breadboard bench-scale prototype under simulated microgravity/partial gravity exploration atmospheres and carry out a 1,500 hr longevity test (at a minimum) to determine its mechanical durability.  xxxxxx on the experimental results, we will design a prototype unit that will meet all of xxxxxx requirements (e.g., low power draw over the range of flows and oxygen levels, lightweight and volume), while delivering the desired oxygen flow and purity.	16196
Oxygen-Independent Pressure Sensitive Paint, Phase II	2017-10-01	2018-07-19	"Pressure sensitive paint (PSP) systems are excellent tools for performing global pressure measurements in aerodynamic testing, especially in wind tunnel studies. The major limitation of PSP for pressure mapping is its dependence on an oxygen-containing flow, since those paints are actually oxygen sensors. Intelligent xxxxxxical xxxxxxs (IOS) is developing a unique coating in which fluorescence quenching can form high resolution images of the true pressure distribution on surfaces in transonic flow in oxygen-free atmospheres. The fluorescence in these unique coatings depends directly on absolute pressure, and oxygen permeation into the coatings is not required. The new coating, however, is completely compatible with the \"legacy\" (oxygen sensing) visualization equipment used in current transonic test facilities. With this novel pressure sensing technology, coating materials can be used that are not useful for oxygen-based PSPs, and coatings that can meet requirements not achievable with classical paints, like operation at extremely low temperature or in highly contaminated environments. In xxxxxx I, IOS has created the oxygen-insensitive pressure-sensitive coating materials, and applied them to glass and stainless steel test coupons. The fluorescence emission lifetime and intensity of these test samples were measured at varying static pressures under pure nitrogen, showing significant correlation with pressure in the range studied (from 0.05 to 14.7 psi), and excellent repeatability. This sets the stage for xxxxxx development and delivery of a complete temperature-compensated true ambient pressure sensitive paint system that can be used to characterize flow around structures in hypersonic wind tunnels. At the end of xxxxxx, the coatings will have been tested at relevant environments (xxxxxx5), and will be available for xxxxxx to begin testing in a high-fidelity laboratory environment (xxxxxx)."	16197

An Integrated Musculoskeletal Countermeasure Battery for Long-Duration Lunar Missions	2012-09-01	2018-07-19	In the past year, we carried out a study to evaluate the effects of ab/adduction exercise on spine bone density and hip bone strength and density measured by quantitative computed tomography and finite element modeling. In 24 healthy subjects, we compared standard aRED lower body exercise, combined aRED, and ab/adduction and ab/adduction only, maintaining the same number of repetitions per group, in a 16 week study, with three exercise sessions per week. Eight subjects were assigned to each group. At the end of the study, two subjects had dropped out, leaving us with 8 subjects in the Ab/Add group, and 7 subjects each in the aRED and combined groups. The three groups showed differential responses of spine and hip bone density and hip bone strength to 16 weeks of training. The group of subjects doing aRED-like exercise consisting of squats and deadlifts showed robust increases in vertebral trabecular bone density (9% p<0.05), as well as smaller but statistically significant increases in femoral neck integral bone density, femoral neck cortical bone density, and femoral neck cortical volume. No changes were observed in the trochanteric region of the hip. No changes were observed in trabecular bone at any subregion of the hip. Using non-linear finite element modeling based on the quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images, we estimated changes of hip whole bone strength under simulated conditions of single-legged stance and a posterolateral fall. We observed that in the aRED-like group, there was a 9% increase in stance strength (p<0.05) but not in fall strength. The group of subjects carrying out abduction and adduction exercise showed no changes in any of the vertebral bone parameters. Abduction and adduction exercise resulted in changes in cortical bone parameters at the trochanter, with a 4.4% increase (p<0.01) in cortical bone volume, and a marginally insignificant 2.1% increase in the trochanteric compressive strength index, which integrates bone density and size to provide a measure of the resistance of the trochanter to compressive loading forces. Finite element computed strength in simulated fall loading resulted in a borderline insignificant trend (p=0.15) towards an increase (5.5%). The group doing combined exercise (half aRED-like and half abduction and adduction) showed no changes in any of the bone parameters. Thus, our study showed that standard aRED exercises consisting of squats, deadlifts, and heel raises have an osteogenic effect on the spine and to a lesser extent on the hip, focused on the femoral neck. While abductor and adductor exercise appears to have a modest osteogenic effect (cortical bone formation) on the trochanter of the hip, the failure of the combined group to show any changes indicates that any adbuctor/adductor exercise needs to be carried out in addition to the standard exercise protocol. The modest effects hint that the proper focus of the exercise could be functional mobility and strength rather than bone protection.	16201

Lifetime Improvement of Large Scale Green Monopropellant Thrusters via Novel, Long-Life Catalysts, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx proposes to develop a high performance, non-toxic storable, \"green\" monopropellant thruster suitable for in-space reaction control propulsion.  The engine will deliver xxxxxx (xxxxxx) vacuum thrust with specific impulse exceeding 240sec.  Estimated xxxxxx-density is on the order of 348 sec-g/cc, a 48% increase from the state-of-the-art hydrazine systems.  The most important feature that sets this thruster apart from other similar devices will be the use of an innovative, long-life catalyst.  This proprietary catalyst, constructed without any bed plate or ceramic substrate, was recently demonstrated in xxxxxx's 0.5N micro thruster.  It has shown the ability to suppress catalyst-related performance degradation problems that often plague green monopropellant thrusters.  The proposed xxxxxx I program will focus on developing a 5N green monopropellant thruster by scaling up the long-life catalyst design from the 0.5N thruster.  Both empirical and modeling works are proposed to validate the scaling theory.  xxxxxx performance will be evaluated based on hot-firing test results that include c* and vacuum thrust measurements.  The xxxxxx I findings will lead to the design of a full-scale, xxxxxx green monopropellant thruster to be developed in xxxxxx."	16205
Nano-Particle Scandate Cathode for Space Communications Phase 2, Phase II	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	We propose an improved cathode based on our novel theory of the role of scandium oxide in enhancing emission in tungsten-impregnated cathodes.  Recent results have demonstrated the efficacy of nano-particle scandium oxide, but a detailed theory on the mechanism of operation has been lacking.  Our theory explains published data and points to an optimized cathode, which we propose here to build and test.  The cathode is the performance-limiting component in high-frequency linear beam amplifiers such as traveling wave tubes and klystrons.  The required bandwidth, data rate, number of channels, frequency, and output power are going up.  The performance of linear beam amplifiers is acutely limited by current cathode performance.  Scandate cathodes offer a way to increase top emission from 10 A/cm2 to at least 50 A/cm2.  xxxxxx I proved the feasibility of applying layers on unagglomerated scandium oxide on impregnated cathodes.  xxxxxx will optimize, test, and commercialize the process.	16206

Relative Position Indicator Concept for Managing Mixed RNAV and Vectored Arrival Traffic, Phase I	2011-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx proposes to study a Relative Position Indicator (RPI) concept for managing mixed xxxxxxV and traditionally vectored arrival traffic, to enable increased adoption of xxxxxxV procedures in airspace or traffic environments that include mixed xxxxxxV and non-xxxxxxV aircraft.  The most common reason controllers give for why xxxxxxV procedures are not used at their airports is the difficulty handling mixed xxxxxxV and non-xxxxxxV flights.  Our proposed concept directly addresses this complaint, providing a controller decision aid to help controllers merge xxxxxxV and non-xxxxxxV aircraft.

An Integrated Heavy Fuel Piston Engine Ducted Fan Propulsion Unit for Personal Air Vehicles, Phase I	2005-01-01	2018-07-19	"The proposed PAVE propulsion system technology demonstration combines an innovative high-speed aero-diesel engine with a novel ducted fan assembly resulting in a low noise/cost and high performance propulsion system.  The core engine makes extensive use of a novel self-injection, compression ignition/combustion system capable of high-speed operation on kerosene-based fuels without degradation due to variations in fuel viscosity, lubricity and cetane value.  Propulsion system safety is greatly enhanced by inherent single lever control, the employment of high flash point fuel, and the absence of fuel injection system degradation when operating on variable viscosity/lubricity xxxxxx fuel having unregulated cetane values.  Competing aero-diesel developments are dependant on OEM fuel system manufactures that are not willing to sell their system intended for aviation use due to the low lubricity of xxxxxx fuel and the high product liability of xxxxxxral Aviation industry.  On the contrary the preferred self-injection system does not require any specialized equipment to produce and is comparable in cost to a carburetor.  The multi-fuel combustion system is controlled by the \"Fuel deposit on the wall\" method of injection.  The controlled combustion is characterized by having modest pressure rise and virtually absent combustion noise thus eliminating the classic \"diesel knock\" and greatly improving the noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) of the installation."	16213
Dynamic Flight Simulation Utilizing High Fidelity CFD-Based Nonlinear Reduced Order Model, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	The Nonlinear Dynamic xxxxxx Simulation (NL-DFS) system will be developed in the xxxxxx project by combining the classical nonlinear rigid-body flight dynamics model with an add-on nonlinear aeroelastic solver to compute the airframe response due to pilot input command and to identify the key aeroelastic coupling mechanisms between the structural dynamics and unsteady aerodynamics with classic rigid-body dynamics. The nonlinear aeroelastic solver solves the aeroelastic equation of motion to add the incremental aeroelastic forces to the right hand side of the 6 degree-of-freedom equation in the flight dynamic model to account for the dynamic aeroelastic effects in the flight dynamic simulation. The generalized aerodynamic forces involved in the nonlinear aeroelastic solvers are provided by three nonlinear aerodynamic xxxxxxd Order xxxxxx (ROMs); namely the modal, gust and control surface ROMs, that are derived from xxxxxx (N-S) solver of xxxxxx. The nonlinear modal ROM is constructed by a neural network model and the nonlinear gust and control surface ROMs are in the form of the first and second order xxxxxx. A wrapper around xxxxxx, called OVERFUN, will be enhanced to drive xxxxxx for generating the training data that leads to the three ROMs. OVERFUN also can directly drive xxxxxx to perform a full order aeroelastic analysis including trim, flutter, gust and maneuver loads analyses whose solutions can be used to verify the accuracy of these three ROMs. The NL-DFS system will be validated with the flight test data of F/A-18 xxxxxx Aeroelastic Wing.	16214

Adaptive Trajectory Design	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxive xxxxxx (ATD) is an original concept for quick and efficient end-to-end trajectory designs using proven piece-wise dynamical methods. With ongoing concept designs of xxxxxx and xxxxxxxxxxxx libration exploration habitat locations and recently demonstrated by xxxxxx support of ARTEMIS, mission design within unstable/stable regions needs the unification of individual trajectories from different dynamical regimes.

ATD is not subject only to designs where dynamical systems and flow topology have advantages but also to initial injection and arrival orbits. Many upcoming missions and proposals incorporate multiple dynamical regimes and require extensive time to complete an end-to-end design, even though the techniques employed during each phase and within each regime may be the best available.Mission design within unstable/stable regions needs unification of individual trajectories from different dynamical regimes. xxxxxx needs an automated process to blend multiple dynamical systems to flow topologically different orbital arcs together easily. xxxxxx an automated process which blends single and multi-body trajectory arcs xxxxxx  various trajectory design concepts into a unified and continuous path quickly and efficiently End goal is a process and developmental software to blend different types of mission design trajectories We will perform the following: xxxxxxorporate additional capabilities for generation of dynamical (Poincaré) maps to assess options and choose the best blend for orbit selection and initial conditions, and capabilities for any sun/planet or planet/moon combination (current algorithms can be reused). xxxxxx with the xxxxxx Mission xxxxxx Tool (xxxxxx) for routine use by the GSFC Navigation and Mission Design Branch. xxxxxx the structure of the algorithm such that future theoretical and technical developments can be easily incorporated.

Multifunctional Shielding and Self-Healing HybridSil Smart Composites for Space, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxSonic has recently developed multifunctional shielding and self-healing HybridSil&#63720; (HS) smart composites via the inclusion of innovative nanoshell inclusions.  These lightweight yet high-strength rapidly self-healing materials combined with xxxxxxSonic's Metal Rubber&#153; (MR) shielding nano-additives and are offered herein as protection systems for xxxxxx vehicles, habitat modules, and pressure vessel structures.

High-Counting Rate Photon Detectors for Long-Range Space Optical Communications, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	Long range, RF space communications do not meet anymore the bandwidth requirements or power constraints of future xxxxxx missions. xxxxxxical communications offer the potential to dramatically increase the link bandwidth and decrease the emitter power. High-bandwidth, long-range optical communications require reliable high-gain, photon-counting detectors operated at moderate cooling with high detection efficiency, large aperture, sub-nanosecond temporal resolution, low intrinsic noise, and capability to handle large optical background. These requirements have not been met yet by single detector designs.We propose to develop a novel large area, photon-counting detector in infrared, operated with moderate cooling, gain greater than 10^6, detection efficiency greater than 50%, 100 MHz saturation counting rate, at least 500 MHz bandwidth, and configurable area. The approach is to develop compact, photon-counting detector arrays based on designs processed in high-volume manufacturing with validated reliability and infrared converters processed on large silicon wafers. This innovation provides a simple solution to high-bandwidth ground-space and space-space optical communications by mitigating optical aperture -- additive noise requirements. In xxxxxx I, we will investigate the integration of the infrared converter into the photon detector processing flow, and will develop the electronics to increase the detector bandwidth and its saturation-counting rate.	16225
Inside-Out Manufacturing of Composite Structures	2012-08-01	2018-07-19	Tooling for the manufacture of large structures from composite materials often costs much more than individual parts, rendering the processes unattractive for prototype designs.  A new design for manufacturing philosphy for multifunctional composite structures is suggested that does not require the use of hard tooling to form large complex shapes.  By utilizing a thin rigid and form-able pre-form such as a metal screen or foam core, fiber reinforcement may be tacked into place and vacuum bagged on both sides to perform resin infusion without the need for any tooling.  The process is expected to be scalable and capable of forming large structures including most shapes envisioned for launch vehicles, exploration vehicles, and habitats. The process will also be applicable to architecture and commercial industrial process equipment such as cooling towers and offshore platforms.  The process could reduce the cost of manufacturing composite prototype structures by more than one-half by eliminating the need for hard tooling.Demonstrate the inside-out manufacturing process by manufacturing a complex shaped composite structure with imbedded wiring and fluid handling without the use of a tooling form. Utilize the core as the tool and build parts from the inside-out, placing utilities before composite structure.  	16226
Sprayable Thermal Insulation for Cryogenic Tanks, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	The innovation addressed in this proposal is Sprayable Thermal Insulation for xxxxxxgenic xxxxxxks, or STICT.  This novel system could be applied in either an automated or manual spraying process, with much less sensitivity to process chemistry and environmental parameters than cur-rent spray-on foam insulation (SOFI) products like BX-265, while providing better insulation performance.  The resulting material would form an aerodynamically smooth, uniform coating with better cohesion and significantly lower thermal conductivity.  This would allow thinner layers of insulation which, when combined with greater material strain-to-failure, will eliminate the generation of in-flight debris.  In this way, the proposed xxxxxxGel insulation can render future space transportation systems safer and more reliable.	16227

Modeling, Testing, and Simulation of Heavy-Ion Basic Mechanisms in Silicon Carbide Power Devices	2020-01-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx management and distribution systems in future xxxxxx flights would benefit greatly from high-voltage DC power, both to reduce power losses and to facilitate solar electric propulsion, the use of ion drives powered by photovoltaic arrays. xxxxxx Carbide (xxxxxx) power transistors are ideal electrical candidates for these applications, but heavy-ion radiation tests (in particle accelerators simulating the radiation environment experienced by space-borne electronics) of xxxxxx Carbide power diodes and xxxxxx power MOSFETs reveal two unexpected phenomena: 1) discrete, permanent increases in off-state current with each ion strike; and 2) a single-event-burnout (SEB) type of hard failure where off-state current increases suddenly to destructive levels after an ion strike at bias levels only a fraction of the device maximum voltage rating. Experimentally observed heavy-ion behavior in xxxxxx power devices is not currently captured in xxxxxx-solver xxxxxx Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) finite-element simulation programs. It is unclear why the heavy-ion response of xxxxxx devices differs so much from that of silicon power diodes and MOSFETs. Possible explanations include the wide band-gap and complex band structure of xxxxxx, the anisotropic structure of the xxxxxx crystal, lattice defects, and local disruption of the crystal structure by the energy deposition of the heavy ion. This work will seek to identify the physical mechanisms in the heavy ion response of xxxxxx power devices through physical analysis, electrical and radiation testing, and device simulation, and to develop new and appropriate physics models for TCAD device simulation software that facilitate describing these physical mechanisms and their effect on device behavior. Once these mechanisms are well-understood, mitigation measures can be undertaken by device manufacturers to make the next generation of xxxxxx devices less vulnerable to radiation effects, enabling xxxxxx to use these power transistors to achieve their goals of high voltage, highly efficient, lightweight and compact space power systems.	16231

Future NAS Flight Demand Generation Tool, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	Aviation and Air Traffic Management researchers are increasingly utilizing complex regional or NAS-wide simulations to evaluate future concepts. These analyses require many thousands of flights (a flight schedule) that are each accurately defined for every stage of the flight (a flight plan).  Current methods of generating these huge input datasets are costly and time-intensive. The largely manual nature of the current process and lack of existing automation tools leaves great potential for significant errors in the data sets.  We propose to develop a powerful automated system for future demand generation.  This tool will be able to input a variety of existing FAA and xxxxxx flight data sets, provide the user with extensive options on defining the future demand data set, and output new flight data sets in formats compatible with major research simulation and analysis tools. This capability will provide xxxxxx and FAA research programs with significantly better analysis conclusions through the new ability to perform extensive sensitivity studies on new concepts to ensure they are robust to alternate potential future demand scenarios.  This is crucial to ensuring the decision to proceed with a multi-million dollar Decision Support Tool development is robust to alternate future demand possibilities.	16237

The tensile strength of the low-density polyethylene composites with DWNTs was evaluated to be in excess of 200 MPa, and the xxxxxx's modulus exceeds 3500 MPa, while the composite toughness is retained at a very high level of ca. 10 J/cm3. These values compare favorably to the strongest polymer films, including those of aramide polymers. The thermal oxidation degradation point of polyethylene is up-shifted by more than 100 oC at 1 wt. % loading of the DWNT filler. A prominent increase in proton radiation shielding efficiency, reaching 35 % in terms of water equivalence thickness was obtained for composites containing DWNTs and fullerene hydrides. Virtually no degradation in properties was observed upon proton irradiation.In xxxxxx, the central technological achievement of xxxxxx I effort, the effective lamination of the unique as-produced DWNT films with polyethylene will be further developed for manufacturing practical composite articles for aerospace applications, including advanced components for EVA suits. The DWNTs, fullerene hydrides and appropriate thermoplastic polymers will be explored for composite components.	16239
Software for Automated Generation of Reduced Thermal Models for Spacecraft Thermal Control, Phase II	2014-02-01	2018-07-19	Thermal analysis is increasingly used in the engineering of spacecrafts at every stage, including design, test, and ground-operation simulation. Currently used high-fidelity modeling and simulation tools at xxxxxx are computationally prohibitive and not fully compatible with integrated analysis of spacecrafts. We propose to develop and demonstrate an innovative xxxxxx Order Reduction (MOR) software to automatically generate nonlinear reduced thermal models for spacecraft analysis. The underlying principle of our approach is to project the original full models onto a characteristic, low-dimensional subspace, yielding reduced models with markedly low computational orders. During xxxxxx, key technology elements were developed and proof-of-concept was successfully demonstrated. A MOR engine encapsulating carefully selected nonlinear MOR algorithms, a reduced model solver and a verification module along with facile data exchange interfaces, were developed in an integrated software environment. By way of whole-satellite (xxxxxx) case studies, critical evidence was established that reduced thermal models enable unprecedented speedup (10500X) and accuracy (<0.3%) for spacecraft analysis and design. In xxxxxx 2, MOR engines will be optimized for enhanced computational performance. Robust constituent linear algorithms and domain-wise projection spaces will be developed to improve simulation stability and accuracy. xxxxxx MOR capabilities to address variable-dependent models and parameterized MOR to accommodate design perturbations will be investigated. Our MOR software will be extensively verified and demonstrated for complex spacecraft thermal analysis. An application programming interface (API) will be developed in close collaboration with leading xxxxxx vendors (C&R Technologies) to facilitate technology insertion and transition.	16240
Discovering Anomalous Aviation Safety Events Using Scalable Data Mining Algorithms	2014-09-08	2018-07-19	The worldwide civilian aviation system is one of the most complex dynamical systems created. Most modern commercial aircraft have onboard flight data recorders that record several hundred discrete and continuous parameters at approximately 1Hz for the entire duration of the flight. These data contain information about the flight control systems, actuators, engines, landing gear, avionics, and pilot commands. In this paper, recent advances in the development of a novel knowledge discovery process consisting of a suite of data mining techniques for identifying precursors to aviation safety incidents are discussed. The data mining techniques include scalable multiple-kernel learning for large-scale distributed anomaly detection. A novel multivariate time-series search algorithm is used to search for signatures of discovered anomalies on massive datasets. The process can identify operationally significant events due to environmental, mechanical, and human factors issues in the high-dimensional flight operations quality assurance data. All discovered anomalies are validated by a team of independent domain experts. This novel automated knowledge discovery process is aimed at complementing the state-of-the-art human-generated exceedance-based analysis that fails to discover previously unknown aviation safety incidents. In this paper, the discovery pipeline, the methods used, and some of the significant anomalies detected on real-world commercial aviation data are discussed.	16241

The components of the proposed system are simple, rugged, stable, and inexpensive, and detection will be both rapid and highly sensitive.  In xxxxxx I, we will synthesize the diagnostic reagents and demonstrate proof-of-concept by their ability to detect nucleic acids.  In xxxxxx, they will be incorporated into a portable prototype instrument designed for single- or multi-sample detection.

SPS Fabrication of Nuclear CERMET Fuel Materials using W Powder Coated UO2 Feedstocks	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	To overcome the NTP propellant feedstock challenges, MSFC developed a new powder coating technique that uses a polymer binder to coat UO2 particles with W prior to fuel element fabrication. This current effort will involve evaluation of the new powder coated feedstock material and xxxxxx (SPS) as an innovative method of fabricating cermet fuel for NTP applications. This effort will include (1) assessment of the viability of the powder coated UO2 feedstock, and (2) evaluation of the SPS system as a suitable method to produce fuel material with the appropriate material properties. The end goal is a characterized W/UO2 fuel wafer that can potentially be further processed to produce a sub-scale prototypic fuel element.	16243
Alternative Fabrication Designs for Carbon-Carbon (C-C) Nozzle Extensions, Phase I	2012-08-01	2018-07-19	In order for carbon-carbon nozzle extensions and exit cones to serve as practical, low cost components for future xxxxxxto-Orbit propulsion systems, it is necessary to develop alternative fabrication methods coupled with proven design and analysis tools. Two-dimensional (2D) C-C components are typically less expensive and potentially lower weight than C-C parts fabricated using 3D woven preforms.	16244
Model Updating in Online Aircraft Prognosis Systems, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx and prognostic algorithms for many aircraft subsystems are steadily maturing. Unfortunately there is little experience integrating these technologies into a complete and practical on-board prognosis system, and integration often proceeds in an ad-hoc manner. Sentient Corporation proposes to develop a general-purpose architecture and set of reusable algorithms for integrating diagnostics and predictive models into an efficient and highly accurate prognostic system. The architecture is based on a flexible and powerful model updating algorithm that provides optimal fusion of diagnostics with model-based state indications and minimization of uncertainty in remaining life predictions. This project will focus on development of several key features of that algorithm, including automatic recognition of a failure that is not progressing according to the physical model, and practical considerations for on-board use such as minimizing computational and memory requirements. By the end of xxxxxx, Sentient will demonstrate a working prototype of an on-board prognostic system developed using the proposed architecture and tools. This demonstration will use diagnostic and model algorithms developed under the DAxxxxxx Prognosis Program, and will be compared to a large set of fault data for turbine engine and subscale bearings.	16245
Ultra-Low-Density (ULD) Polymer Matrix Composites (PMCs), Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	"This xxxxxx xxxxxx I xxxxxx proposal seeks to demonstrate a new class of ultra-low-density (ULD) polymer matrix composites of high specific modulus and specific strength for mass sensitive space and aerospace applications.  the \"baseline\" composite system for this program is state-of-the-art carbon fiber reinforced epoxy and/or bismaliimide. The key materials innovations are light-weight hollow carbon fibers in a light-weight porous (closed pores) polymer matrix. This innovation in composites technology would enable structural composites of lower density and higher specific modulus and strength than any currently available. If successful, this technology could have a profound impact and reduced payload weight and cost. Potential applications include planetary landers, satellites, large orbiting arrays and structures, booster motor cases. This program benefits from the support and participation of xxxxxx and xxxxxx."	16246
Objective Detection, Evaluation and Countermeasures for In-flight Depression	2011-10-01	2018-07-19	In the past year, we made significant progress in three primary areas: experimental, computational, and technology development. On the experimental front we completed our neuroimaging study of depression. The goal was to identify more objective brain biomarkers for detecting depression and for assessing depression severity. We recruited 20 depressed individuals (age 30-60, xxxxxx's degree or higher, un-medicated) along with 19 matched healthy controls and collected data on multiple structural and functional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and NIN measures. Measures were examined for (1) their ability to detect depression (xxxxxxa), and (2) their ability to assess depression severity (xxxxxxb). We identified multiple putative brain biomarkers for both detection and assessment, including both structural and functional brain measures. Manuscripts are in preparation.     We also completed data analysis for two analog tests. In our head-down tilt (HDT) study, headward fluid shifts were hypothesized to adversely affect NIN sensitivity while performing our depression study's working memory tasks. xxxxxxt sensitivity loss was observed during acute -6 degree HDT relative to +45 degree head up tilt, but similar functional activation was still detected by NIN. This demonstrated the sensitivity of NIN to brain function in these tasks (xxxxxx), as well as the robustness of NIN to HDT. In our Aug 2010 Kilimanjaro analog study, we examined data from 6 hikers at 6 different altitudes performing xxxxxx and xxxxxx maneuvers. We observed significant increases in cerebral blood volume (CBV) with altitude, but significant decreases in CBV in individuals affected by acute mountain sickness. This demonstrated (1) the ability to perform NIN experiments monitoring cerebral physiology in an extreme environment, (2) the sensitivity of NINscan 2a to cerebral hemodynamics (xxxxxx), and (3) provided preliminary evidence that cerebral edema and mild increases in intracranial pressure are involved in acute mountain sickness.     On the computational front, we completed analysis of our simulations modeling the distribution of photons migrating through the head. This generated the most detailed maps to date of NIN sensitivity to brain tissue and also supports xxxxxx. xxxxxx was found to be more spatially variable than previously assumed, but we identified ways to design probes and devices to compensate for such sensitivity differences. Two manuscripts describing the results of this work are currently under review.     On the technology development front, we completed NINscan 3a, a next-generation device that is considerably more sensitive and capable than NINscan 2a. We also completed NINscan TD, a microcontroller-based design that provides even more flexibility (including light and detector gain controls) as well as a proof of concept design for scaling to whole-head neuroimaging. These efforts strongly support the goal of developing technologies suitable for brain imaging in spaceflight (xxxxxx 2).	16247

Two Scan Heads are Better Than One: Integration of a Second Scan Pedestal for Co-manifesting CoSMIR, CoSSIR, and/or HyMAS	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	Simultaneous observations of atmospheric water vapor, temperature and clouds are essential to improving climate and weather models. Measurements of cloud ice and precipitation profiles and stheir microphysical properties are required to unravel the coupling between the Earth&rsquo;s hydrologic cycle (precipitation) and radiative energy budget processes. Understanding the coupling between clouds and precipitation, and Earth&rsquo;s energy budget and hydrological cycle are goals embedded within the xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and Ecosystems (ACE) mission and the xxxxxx and Precipitation xxxxxxess Mission (CaPPM). This IRAD bridges a critical gap in xxxxxx&rsquo;s airborne millimeter and submillimeter-wave cloud remote sensing by assembling a second scan pedestal for xxxxxx, CoSSIR, and HyMAS radiometers to operate jointly. The second scan pedestal will enable two of the three radiometers to fly concurrently, e.g. co-manifested on xxxxxx&rsquo;s ER-2 research aircraft, providing an unprecedented range of microwave spectral coverage for cloud, precipitation, temperature and water vapor measurements. By demonstrating these capabilities on research aircraft, xxxxxx will reduce the risk for deploying millimeter and submillimeter radiometers on future spaceflight missions. The Compact xxxxxx xxxxxx Imaging xxxxxx (xxxxxx) was originally developed as a calibration and validation instrument for the Defense Meteorological xxxxxx Program. xxxxxx has channels spanning 51 GHz and 183 GHz. Its novel azimuth over elevation dual-axes gimbals permit contiguous conical and across-track imaging with interleaved hot/cold calibration. xxxxxx currently serves as the xxxxxx Precipitation Mission (xxxxxx) xxxxxx (GMI) simulator.&nbsp;The Compact xxxxxx xxxxxxmm-wave Imaging xxxxxx (CoSSIR) has channels spanning 183 GHz and 870 GHz and operates using the same scan pedestal as xxxxxx.&nbsp; CoSSIR has pioneered the application of submillimeter-wave radiometric sensing of ice clouds contributing vital data leading to the inclusion of the Ice xxxxxx xxxxxx (ICI) on ESA&rsquo;s next generation xxxxxx satellite (due to launch in 2022). Its measurements were the impetus for selection of IceCube, a cubesat technology demonstration of 900 GHz receiver technology with a planned xxxxxx release in 2016.The Hyperspectral xxxxxx Atmospheric xxxxxx (HyMAS) is an xxxxxx and xxxxxx Office (ESTO)&nbsp; funded instrument developed in partnership with MIT Lincoln xxxxxx and is designed to use the xxxxxxxxCoSSIR scan pedestal. HyMAS is a highly innovative hyperspectral sounder with fifty-two channels spanning the 118 GHz oxygen and 183 GHz water vapor lines. The completion of integration and laboratory testing is anticipated to be complete in xxxxxxember 2015.At present, there is only one pedestal that accommodates the xxxxxx, CoSSIR, and HyMAS scanheads.&nbsp; These instruments cannot be flown together since they share the same infrastructure; the scan pedestal includes basic mounting of the scan head, the scanning mechanism and control electronics (conical and cross-track), two blackbody calibrators and calibration/house keeping computer, aircraft interface, and data acquisition and systems.	16249
Age and Space Irradiation Modulate Tumor Progression: Implications for Carcinogenesis Risk	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	Age plays a major role in tumor incidence and is an important consideration when modeling the carcinogenesis process or estimating cancer risks. Epidemiological data show that from adolescence through middle age cancer incidence increases with age. This effect is commonly attributed to a lifetime accumulation of cellular particularly DNA damage. xxxxxxver during middle-age the incidence begins to decelerate and for many tumor sites it actually decreases at sufficiently advanced ages. We investigated if the observed deceleration and potential decrease in incidence could be attributed to a decreased capacity of older hosts to support tumor progression and whether HZE (high atomic number (Z) high energy (E)) radiation differentially modulates tumor progression in young versus middle-age hosts issues relevant to estimating carcinogenesis risk for astronauts. xxxxxx lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were injected into syngeneic mice (143 and 551 days old) which were then subject to whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu). Three findings emerged: 1) among unirradiated animals substantial inhibition of tumor progression and significantly decreased tumor growth rates were seen for middle-aged mice compared to young mice; 2) whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) inhibited tumor progression in both young and in middle-aged mice (with greater suppression seen in case of young animals) with little effect on tumor growth rates; and 3) 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) suppressed tumor progression in young mice to a degree not significantly different than transiting from young to middle-aged. Thus 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) acted similar to aging with respect to tumor progression. We further investigated the molecular underpinnings driving the radiation modulation of tumor dynamics in young and middle-aged mice. Through global gene expression analysis the key players FASN AKT1 and the CXCL12/CXCR4 complex were determined to be contributory. In sum these findings demonstrate a reduced capacity of middle-aged hosts to support the progression phase of carcinogenesis and identify molecular factors contributory to HZE radiation modulation of tumor progression as a function of age. For genome-wide expression profiling of tumor tissue Mouse WG-6 BeadArray chips (Illumina xxxxxx CA) were used. Total xxxxxx was amplified with the Ambion Illumina TotalPrep Amplification xxxxxx (Ambion xxxxxx TX) and labeled from all replicate biological samples for each condition. The number of tumor sample replicates used from each condition is as follows: 10 samples from young unirradiated mice 8 samples from young irradiated mice 7 samples from middle-aged unirradiated mice 5 samples from middle-aged irradiated mice. Total xxxxxx was isolated and purified using Trizol (Invitrogen) or RNeasy (Qiagen) quantified and qualified using Agilent xxxxxxanalyzer (Agilent) and samples were deemed suitable for amplification and hybridization if they had O.D. 260/280 = 1.7 - 2.1 28s/18s = 2:1 RIN (xxxxxx integrity number) >7. Total xxxxxx of 500ng per sample was amplified using Ambion TotalPrep (Ambion) and 1.5ug of the product was loaded onto the chips. Following hybridization at 55C the chips were washed and then scanned using the Illumina iScan (Illumina) and the data were analyzed using GenomeStudio (Illumina). xxxxxx were first analyzed for gene expression and then culled for present genes (genes that meet the criteria of detection p-value < 0.05). Expression above background was included in an expressed genes working data set for further analyses. Rank variant normalization was applied to the data before extensive analysis. Differential gene expression analysis was used to compare to the reference group young unirradiated mice and genes were then evaluated and validated.	16250
High Efficiency Semiconductor Arrays for Hard X-Ray Imaging, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	The next generation of wide-field survey instruments with improved angular and energy resolution for research into astrophysical transient X-ray phenomena is currently under development. A scalable detector plane architecture has been developed at Harvard using CZT detector arrays for use in high resolution coded-aperture telescopes.Despite decades of research, the yield of device grade CZT is still quite low. In addition, internal defects cause spatial distortions in images. To meet the needs of hard X-ray astronomy a lower cost, more uniform and more readily available alternative to CZT is desirable.Thallium bromide (TlBr) has higher density and atomic number than CZT and therefore higher stopping power at hard X-ray energies. TlBr has a low melting point (460 &#8304;C, compared to ~ 1100 &#8304;C for CZT) and cubic crystal structure and can be grown from the melt by low cost techniques. As a result, TlBr has the potential to be a more efficient, lower cost alternative to CZT in the detector plane architecture developed by Harvard for use in high resolution coded-aperture telescopes.	16251
Simulating Degradation Data for Prognostic Algorithm Development	2010-09-10	2018-07-19	**PHM08 Challenge xxxxxx is now publicly available at the xxxxxx Prognostics xxxxxxpository + [Download](xxxxxx)****INTRODUCTION - WHY SIMULATE DEGRADATION xxxxxx various challenges encountered in prognostics algorithm development, the non-availability of suitable validation data is most often the bottleneck in the technology certification process. Prognostics imposes several requirements on the training data in addition to what is commonly available from various applications. It not only requires data containing fault signatures but also that contains fault evolution trends with corresponding time indexes (in number of hours or number of operational cycles). In general there are three sources from which data is usually available, namely: Fielded applications, experimental test-beds, and computer simulations (see [xxxxxxure 1](xxxx)).  From prognostics point of view, data collection paradoxically suffers from the situation that the systems that do run to failure often did not have warning instrumentation installed, hence no or little record of what went wrong. In the other situation, those that are continuously monitored are prevented from running to failure or are subject to maintenance that eliminates the signatures of fault evolution. Conducting experiments that replicate real world situations is extremely expensive in terms of time required for a healthy system to run to failure and is often dangerous. Accelerated ageing may be useful to some extent but may not emulate normal wear patterns.  Furthermore, to manage uncertainty multiple datasets must be collected to quantify variations resulting from multiple sources, which makes it all the way more unattainable. Simulations can be fast, inexpensive, and provide a number of options to design experiments, but their usefulness is contingent on the availability of high fidelity models that represent the real systems fairly well. xxxxxxver, once such a model is available, simulations offer the flexibility to rerun various experiments with added knowledge from the system as it becomes available. Where, availability of real fault evolution data from the fielded systems would be more desirable, generating data using a high fidelity model and integrating it with the knowledge gathered from the partial data obtained from the real systems is by far the most practical approach for prognostics algorithm development, validation, and verification. In this  presentation we discuss some key elements that must be kept in mind while generating datasets suitable for prognostics. Furthermore, with the help of an example it has been shown how a dynamical system model can be supported with suitable degradation models available from respective domain knowledge to create suitable data.  The example is discussed next. **APPLICATION DOxxxxxx**Tracking and xxxxxxing the progressionof damage in aircraft turbo machinery has been an active area of study within the Condition xxxxxx xxxxxx (CBM) community. A general approach has been to correlate flow and effciency losses to degradation signtures in various components of the engine. Once such mapping is available, the next task is to estimate this loss of flow and eficiency inferring information from measurable sensor outputs, which ultimtely is used to assess the level of degradation in the system. **SYSTEM xxxxxxEL: C-MAPSS**The C-MAPSS (Commercial xxxxxx Aero Propulsion xxxxxx Simulation) is a tool, recently released, for simulating a realistic large commercial turbofan engine. C-MAPSS (Commercial xxxxxx Aero-Propulsion xxxxxx Simulation) that simulates a realistic large (~90,000lb) commercial turbofan engine. It allows the user to choose and design operational profiles, controllers, environmental conditions, thrust levels, etc. to simualte a scenario of interest. An extensive list of output variables is available that simulate sensor channels. Most importantly, it allows user to tune eficiency and flow parameters to simulate specific fault modes. They are required to generate a two dimensional map ([xxxxxxure 2](xxxx)) between these parameters and the degradation indicator of interest. Industry typically uses operability margins of main engine rotating components namely e.g. xxxxxx, LPC, HPT, LPT, and xxxxxx ([xxxxxxure 3](xxxx)) **DEGRADATION xxxxxxELING**The simulations were run to generate data for various flight profiles an engine might go through to accumulate degradation during its life-span. This scenario models engine performance degradation due to wear and tear based on the usage pattern of the engines and not necessarily due to any particular fault mode. Therefore, sudden degradation during a flight is rather unlikely. This allowed taking one measurement snapshot per flight to characterize the engine health during or right after that flight. Specific components of degradation simulation modeled are:**- Initial Wear:**  Initial wear can occur due to manufacturing inefficiencies and are commonly observed in real systems. xxxxxxhough it is not considered abnormal, it can make a difference in useful operational life of a component. the degree of wear was modeled based on information available from domain literature.     **- Noise:** Of various sources, the main sources of noise while assessing the true state of system’s health are manufacturing and assembly variations, process noise (due to factors not taken in to account while modeling the process), and measurement noise to name a few important ones. These noise sources introduce their respective contributions at different stages of the process and a combined effect is observed in the sensor measurements at the end. Noise perturbations were injected at different stages based on information from the literature in noise modeling. (please see attached document for details)     **- Damage Propagation xxxxxx:** [Common models](xxxxxx) used across different application domains include the Arrhenius model, the Coffin-Manson mechanical crack growth model, and the Eyring model (for more than three stresses or when the above models are not satisfactory). Several variations of these models have been adopted for specific applications; however, common to all degradation models is the exponential behavior of the fault evolution. Further, some evidence available from the domain literature prompted the use of a generalized exponential degradation model. The generic nature of the model used in simulations ignores micro-level processes but retains macro-level degradation characteristics that are considered important for prognostics algorithm development independent of any specific application domain.      [tex] h(t) = 1 - d_i - Ae^{B(t)}/th_w [/tex] where    [tex]d_i [/tex] is initial wear    [tex]th_w [/tex] is the upper wear threshold    [tex]B(t)[/tex]  adds a non-stationary characterstic to degradation pattern    [tex]A[/tex] is a scaling constant **HEALTH INDEX**As degradation prameters evolve C-MAPSS simulates a degrading system. The extent of degradation at any instant can be assessed by determinng how various health indcators are approaching their threshold margins. Typically stall margins for rotating components of the engine (fan, turbine, and compressor) and exhaust gas temperature are monitored to determine the state of health. As degradation increases one or many of these parameters approach critical limits. Following the same methodology a Health Index (HI) is computed as the simulation proceeds.The health index can be used to model different phenomena within a subsystem. Specifically, for aircraft engine modules like the compressor and turbine sections, the health is described both by efficiency (e) and flow (f). Trajectories for flow and efficiency vary for different fault modes and are modeled as separate health related indices as shown below:         [tex]e(t) = 1 - d_e - e^{a_e(t)^{b_e(t)}} [/tex]         [tex]f(t) = 1 - d_f - e^{a_f(t)^{b_f(t)}} [/tex] , and        the terms e(t) and f(t) are then combined to form the overall health H(t), i.e.         [tex]H(t) = g(e(t),f(t)) [/tex]    where, the function [tex]g[/tex]  is the minimum of all operative margins considered (here for fan, xxxxxx, HPT, and EGT).       [tex]g(e(t),f(t)) = min(m_{fan}, m_{xxxxxx}, m_{HPT}, m_{EGT})[/tex]where the margins[tex]m[/tex]s are the functions of efficiency and flow parameters. If system degradation is plotted on flow-efficiency axes, various margins indicating the deterioration can be depicted as shown in [xxxxxxure 4](xxxx). A threshold boundary separates the failure region for respective margins. xxxxxx on the direction of the failure evolution trajectory (simulated by changing e and f parameters) a threshold may or may not be crossed. Therefore, the overall health index is determined by the margin that approaches the corresponding limit first. More details about HI calculation can be found in the attached paper. **PHM DATA CHALLENGE ([details](xxxxxx))**xxxxxx generated in this effort was used for PHM xxxxxx Challenge at the 1st International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management ([PHM08](xxxxxxphm/)). Six different flight conditions were simulated that comprised of a range of values for three operational conditions: altitude (0-42K ft.), xxxxxx number (0-0.84), and TRA (20-100).The objective was to generate train, test, and validation data sets for development of data-driven prognostics. To that end, a reasonably large number of trajectories were created from C-MAPSS. To avoid over-fitting to the test data, the validation set was withheld and published later, without feedback of the score until after the competition had closed. Three winning entries are being featured in a special session at the conference. Please refer to conference proceedings to learn more about how different approaches can be used to predict RUL of the aircraft engine. **CONCLUSION**   This poster discusses the data generation process using C-MAPPS, validity and usefulness of such data, and potential advantages in developing and maturing prognostic algorithms. Overall, this effort shows how in general industry expert knowledge can be used in tandem with high fidelity system models to reduce data availability gaps in the prognostics area.	16252

Gene expression profiling of PBL in response to ionising radiation and modeled microgravity	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation (IR) can be extremely harmful for human cells since an improper DNA-damage response (DDR) to IR can contribute to carcinogenesis initiation. Perturbations in DDR pathway can originate from alteration in the functionality of the microxxxxxx-mediated gene regulation being microxxxxxxs (mixxxxxxs) small noncoding xxxxxx that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. In this study we gained insight into the role of mixxxxxxs in the regulation of DDR to IR under microgravity a condition of weightlessness experienced by astronauts during space missions which could have a synergistic action on cells increasing the risk of radiation exposure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed mixxxxxx expression profile of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) incubated for 4 and 24 h in normal gravity (1 g) and in modeled microgravity (MMG) during the repair time after irradiation with 0.2 and 2Gy of gamma-rays. Our results show that MMG alters mixxxxxx expression signature of irradiated PBL by decreasing the number of radio-responsive mixxxxxxs. Moreover let-7i* miR-7 miR-7-1* miR-27a miR-144 miR-200a miR-598 miR-650 are deregulated by the combined action of radiation and MMG. xxxxxxted analyses of mixxxxxx and mxxxxxx expression profiles carried out on PBL of the same donors identified significant mixxxxxx-mxxxxxx xxxxxxcorrelations of DDR pathway. xxxxxx analysis reports that the biological category of xxxxxx to DNA damage is enriched when PBL are incubated in 1 g but not in MMG. Moreover some xxxxxxcorrelated genes of p53-pathway show a different expression level between 1 g and MMG. Functional validation assays using luciferase reporter constructs confirmed mixxxxxx-mxxxxxx interactions derived from target prediction analyses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: On the whole by integrating the transcriptome and microRxxxxxx we provide evidence that modeled microgravity can affects the DNA-damage response to IR in human PBL. Overall Design: xxxxxx expression signature was defined in PBL irradiated with gamma-rays (xxxxxx) and incubated in modeled microgravity (mmg) and in parallel ground conditions (1g) for 24h. Five independent experiments were performed for each donor to address which mxxxxxxs were regulated on IR stress. The level of each transcript was represented as Log2.	16254
A Heat Switch for Space Applications, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Various planned xxxxxx missions require heat switches for active thermal control. As an example cryocoolers, including redundant coolers are incorporated on select missions. The redundant coolers operate when deteriorating or defunct coolers are deactivated. xxxxxxver, integration of redundant coolers may cause substantial parasitic heat loads unless the cold regions are thermally connected to the active cryocooler only. The overall system efficiency will depend in part on the efficacy of the intervening heat switches. We propose to develop a highly effective, innovative prototype heat switch that combines two recently developed technologies. First, it employs a highly conductive thermal contact at a low applied force. xxxxxxondly, the heat switch employs an innovative bi-stable actuator. The actuator requires little energy to switch between states and can achieve motion on the order of millimeters. This available motion exceeds the tens to hundreds of microns needed to engage the contact, enabling complete separation, and thus, excellent thermal isolation in the off state. Combining the inherently high on- and low off-conductance of the contacts with the bi-stable actuator positioning provides for a highly effective, innovative heat switch, potentially enabling significant performance enhancement of xxxxxx missions.	16255

EDL Sensor Suite, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxical Air xxxxxx xxxxxxs (OADS) L.L.C. proposes a LIDAR based remote measurement sensor suite capable of satisfying a significant number of the desired sensing requirements in a compact, lightweight, and extremely power efficient form factor.  OADS all-fiber optic LIDAR and xxxxxx xxxxxx (LDV) technology is capable of measuring precise height above ground, ground speed, ground drift, range-gated relative winds, ambient temperature, as well as ambient pressure through the entire entry and descent phase of the spacecraft.  Unlike other LIDAR solutions that would require imaging around or through the aeroshell, OADS patented LDV solutions can directly measure a range map of the terrain while simultaneously providing surface relative velocity information for navigation near the ground.   OAD LDV solutions include a remote wind sensor capable of measuring wind information at multiple distances ahead of the spacecraft during the entry and descent phases.  Once descent is complete, the sensor can be used on the ground to collect local environmental data (including surface winds) as advance information for the fetch rover, the planetary ascent vehicle, and for future missions.	16259

High energy density additives for Hybrid Fuel Rockets to Improve Performance and Enhance Safety	2012-01-01	2018-07-19	We propose a conceptual study of prototype strained hydrocarbon molecules as high energy density additives for hybrid rocket fuels to boost the performance of these rockets without compromising safety and reliability. Use of these additives could extend the range of applications for which hybrid rockets become an attractive alternative to conventional solid or liquid fuel rockets. The objectives of the study were to confirm and quantify the high enthalpy of these strained molecules and to assess improvement in rocket performance that would be expected if these additives were blended with conventional fuels. We confirmed the chemical properties (including enthalpy) of these additives. xxxxxxver, the predicted improvement in rocket performance was too small to make this a useful strategy for boosting hybrid rocket performance.Hybrid rockets use a solid fuel with a liquid or gaseous oxidizer. They have advantages over solid fuel rockets for certain space applications because the solid fuel component is more stable than combined solid fuel and oxidizer, and advantages over liquid fuel rockets because the fuel does not require cryogenic storage or pumping and the burn rate can be controlled by regulating the flow of oxidizer. Ideal fuels should a fast regression rate, high density and good mechanical stability (so it will not break apart during burning). A current project at ARC is evaluating hybrid rockets comprised of solid paraffin fuel and cryogenic nitrous oxide and LOX oxidizer and has shown that higher regression rates are needed. xxxxxxed cyclic hydrocarbons have positive enthalpy and can be blended with paraffins to make fuels for hybrid rockets, but to be effective the resulting solid must have physical and mechanical characteristics at least comparable to the pure paraffin fuels. The stable hydrocarbon molecules with the highest strain energy are comprised of triangular rings of carbon atoms (cyclopropane), but these are gases at normal temperatures and pressures. Recently, chemists have synthesized molecules (called ivyanes, shown in xxxxxxure 1) containing multiple cyclopropane rings bonded together. We propose investigating blends of ivyanes and paraffins to determine their thermochemical and physical properties. We will first carry out simulations to predict enthalpy, density and stability of these blends using first principles chemistry and physics methods. Previously, first principles calculations by two of us (Jaffe and xxxxxx, xxxxxx. 2010, 75, 4387) demonstrated thermochemical properties can be determined to an accuracy of 2 kJ/mol for hydrocarbon molecules containing 10-20 carbon atoms. In the second phase, the density, melting temperature and heat of sublimation of solid ivyanes and the blends will be determined from molecular dynamics simulations.	16262

SCONES: Secure Content-Oriented Networking for Exploring Space, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	We envision a secure content-oriented internetwork as a natural generalization of the cache-and-forward architecture inherent in delay-tolerant networks. Using our approach, users can specify their interests or publish content and expect infrastructure to securely match the supply and demand without loss of confidentiality.  When doing so, users of a content-oriented network need not concern themselves about the location of the content.  Our work addresses the following question:  Can nodes in the space network make content-oriented forwarding, caching, and retrieval decisions based on encrypted metadata and encrypted interests (publish/subscribe advertisements) without decrypting them?  We believe that recent developments in cryptography in the ares of secure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption make this possible.  We propose to develop fast pragmatic algorithms that can be implemented within the context of IETF Delay-Tolerant xxxxxx and CCSDS Asynchronous Messaging Service protocols that are being evaluated by xxxxxx to support future xxxxxx exploration missions.	16265
Miniature Intelligent Wireless Fire Detector System, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	"The objective of this project is to develop a wireless intelligent dual-band photodetector system for advanced fire detection/recognition, combining UV/IR xxxxxx nitride material photodiode structures controlled by FPGA portable circuitry, with a neural network identification capability. xxxxxxl range, detector speed, spatial resolution become critical for fast fire detection as well as for avoiding costly false alarms. Current detectors are bulky, have low mechanical and temperature strength, and cannot be easily integrated into networks. Miniature, chip-based dual-color high-temperature visible- or even solar-blind optical sensor system would allow for fast and false alarm-free fire detection and recognition, thus providing a fast and reliable response in separated UV and IR bands with high spatial resolution, and \"smart\", artificial neural networks based signal analysis Moreover, development of such sensors will promote fabrication of multi-pixel dual-band UV/IR focal plane arrays with a visible- or solar-blind imaging capability.  This project will also consider integration the optical sensor system with existing state of the art smoke sensors for detection of smoldering (flameless) fires as well. One of the approaches for such integration is based on placing the remote high sensitivity dual-band UV/IR focal plane arrays integrated smoke detectors in areas that are prone to possible fires, such as aircraft or spacecraft engines and power circuits. These devices will then communicate with one central control system that analyses the nature and type of flame and sound an alarm accordingly. The second approach is to integrate the smoke and the high sensitivity dual-band UV/IR focal plane array detector into a unit controlled by one system, and then place them in a close proximity of possible fire sources."	16266

Advanced Capacitors for High-Power Applications, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	As the consumer and industrial requirements for compact, high-power-density, electrical power systems grow substantially over the next decade; there will be a significant need for novel electrode/electrolyte materials for high-power/energy-density capacitors.  To meet the strong market demand for miniaturization and higher capacitance/voltage values in a given case size, new and advanced technologies must be developed and implemented. This proposal addresses the development of an all-solid, high-energy-density, high-power-density, high-voltage capacitor, with substantially reduced Equivalent Series xxxxxx (ESR) and cost. The proposed capacitor combines the advantages of operating voltage associated with certain metal-oxide electrolytic capacitors with some special features of metal-oxide pseudocapacitor material. Compared to the standard solid electrolytic capacitor, the proposed capacitor design will have a higher capacitance and lower resistance, yielding a low-cost, low-ESR device with a simplified packaging process. During xxxxxx I prototype capacitor units will be fabricated and characterized to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. These units will be evaluated and compared to standard capacitors to evaluate the overall benefit of the hybrid capacitors and success in demonstrating concept feasibility.	16268

The results and uncertainties for both procedures are included in this dataset.	16269
Development of High Contrast Lenslets for Integral Field Spectroscopy	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	A key goal of xxxxxx&rsquo;s Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) is to discover xxxxxxlike exoplanets and to determine their spectra for spectral signatures of life. Toward that goal there is on-going development of several competing architectures for how to suppress the starlight and achieve the high contrast necessary to directly image an xxxxxxlike planet in the habitable zone around a nearby star, including coronagraphs, external occulters, and nulling interferometers operating at optical wavelengths.Regardless of the starlight suppression technology chosen, any future planet imaging mission must have a highly capable science instrument able to perform both imaging and spectroscopy in order to detect and characterize the target planets. &nbsp;The ideal instrument for making these measurements is an integral field spectrograph (IFS), an instrument that obtains a spectrum at every spatial element in the field of view.&nbsp;&nbsp;The current state of the art for these instruments does not yet achieve the challenging performance requirements needed for imaging of xxxxxxlike exoplanets due to a variety of challenging systematics. In particular, current lenslet designs introduce too high a level of crosstalk between adjacent spectra to operate at very high contrasts.In space, an IFS science camera will be used to investigate the properties of exoplanets while monitoring and diagnosing wavefront errors introduced by the telescope optical assembly.This research will develop a critical technology needed to build a prototype IFS to advance coronagraphy and extreme wavefront sensing and control algorithms in xxxxxx&rsquo;s High Contrast Imaging xxxxxx (HCIT).&nbsp; Once built, this laboratory IFS will be used as a facility class instrument within the HCIT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work builds upon awards from the FY12 IRAD program and the Nancy Grace Roman xxxxxx Fellowship program.As part of those programs,&nbsp;xxxxxx xxxxxx&nbsp;designed the Prototype Imaging xxxxxxgraph for xxxxxxgraphic Exoplanet Studies (PISCES) integral field spectrograph to be integrated into the JPL HCIT.&nbsp; xxxxxxver, during this the design phase, it became apparent that even though lenslet-based integral field spectrographs exist on the ground, high contrast lenslet arrays are still at a low xxxxxx.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work will&nbsp;design, model, fabricate, and performance assess a specialized lenslet array in order to meet the requirements of a high contrast imaging mission.	16270

Cavitation Peening of Aerospace Bearings, Phase II	2018-02-01	2018-07-19	High-value bearings are a critical part of the safety, reliability, cost and performance of modern aircraft. A typical passenger jet will have 100 to 175 high-valve bearings costing from $2,500 to $50,000 each for a total aircraft cost of $300,000 to $600,000.  All gas turbine engine bearings are inspected at overhaul and typically 30-40% of there are rejected. For each engine overhaul, bearing replacement costs on average $100,000.  Any process that increases bearing performance and reliability will have a commensurate effect on aircraft safety, reliability, performance and operating cost. In xxxxxx I, Ormond demonstrated a novel surface enhancement process, cavitation peening, imparting deep, high magnitude residual stresses that are predicted to significantly enhance bearing life, reliability and performance.  Preliminary fatigue results generated in xxxxxx I look promising and analytical results indicate a fatigue life improvement of over 100% may be possible. Cavitation peening uses ultra-high pressure water jets to generate intense clouds of cavitation bubbles that collapse on the work piece generating shock waves that cold work the material. No particles are use, the process produces no waste and adds no weight to the part and is very inexpensive. The new technology is currently being evaluated by Boeing, xxxxxx, Bell and Rolls-Royce for aerospace applications and is proving particularly effective for gears. The company is also working with major bearing manufacturers Timken and SKF to investigate the value of the technology for bearing applications. The proposed xxxxxx work would refine the process, address readiness level issues and generate the fatigue data that is critical to wide spread acceptance of the cavitation peening technology.	16272
Model-Based Diagnosis and Prognosis of a Water Recycling System	2013-07-23	2018-07-19	A water recycling system (WRS) deployed at xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx’s xxxxxx (an energy efficient office building that integrates some novel technologies developed for space applications) will serve as a testbed for long duration testing of next generation spacecraft water recycling systems for future human spaceflight missions. This system cleans graywater (waste water collected from sinks and showers) and recycles it into clean water. Like all engineered systems, the WRS is prone to standard degradation due to regular use, as well as other faults. xxxxxx and prognostic applications will be deployed on the WRS to ensure its safe, efficient, and correct operation. The diagnostic and prognostic results can be used to enable condition-based maintenance to avoid unplanned out- ages, and perhaps extend the useful life of the WRS. xxxxxx involves detecting when a fault occurs, isolating the root cause of the fault, and identifying the extent of damage. Prognosis involves predicting when the system will reach its end of life irrespective of whether an abnormal condition is present or not. In this paper, first, we develop a physics model of both nominal and faulty system behavior of the WRxxxxxxn, we apply an integrated model-based diagnosis and prognosis framework to the simulation model of the WRS for several different fault scenarios to detect, isolate, and identify faults, and predict the end of life in each fault scenario, and present the experimental results.	16273
IHW COMET HALLEY REDUCED SPECTROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	xxxxxx International xxxxxx Watch (IHW) has created a xxxxxx Archive. The collection of data spans the full wavelength range as submitted by scientists to the IHW. The observations belong to one of the following xxxxxxs: Amateur, Astrometry, xxxxxx Studies, Large-Scale Phenomena, Meteor Studies, Near-Nucleus Studies, Photometry and Polarimetry, Radio Studies, and xxxxxxscopy and xxxxxxphotometry. The data collected by these nine disciplines were augmented by xxxxxx measurements. The data were submitted to IHW, but the evaluation and selection for the Archive has been the primary responsibility of the xxxxxx Specialist xxxxxxs for each network in cooperation with the xxxxxx Center. The xxxxxxscopy and xxxxxxphotometry xxxxxx collected 2732 files of data which were classified as 'reduced', which means that at least wavelength is calibrated and in some cases flux as well. Some data on xxxxxx targets for the spectroscopic observations can be grouped according to 'laboratory' calibration, dark, bias, flatfield, sky, and photometric standards. In the first category, a large number of 'arcs' and 'lamps' were used as follows: HE-NE, TH-AR, NE-AR, CU-AR, CU-NE, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, Quartz, and xxxxxx. For the 'sky' observers used the twilight, moonlight, and blank sky. The most common 'photometric' standards were stars, but observers also included other comets (Hartley-Goode), asteroids (xxxxxx), reflection nebulae (R8), and emission nebulae (NGC1982, NGC7000). A list of these stellar calibration targets follows: HD 140283, HD 184711, HD89688, HD102870, HD120086, HD13974, HD219188, HD 25680, HD 19445, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, SAO 1280, HZ15, CD-22 7696, GD 190, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, G19113213, G 99-37, L745-46A, Feige 15, Feige 56, xxxxxxdolt 98, xxxxxxdolt 92, xxxxxx Beuren, RHO ORION, CHI 1 ORION, 29 PI LEO.

Adaptive Intelligent Ventilation Noise Control, Phase II	2008-12-01	2018-07-19	To address the xxxxxx need for quiet on-orbit crew quarters (CQ), xxxxxxical xxxxxxics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new xxxxxxive Intelligent xxxxxx Noise Control (AIVNC) system to reduce acoustic noise inside the CQ and work spaces. AIVNC is based on a new multimodal, skin-like active noise controller that will be easy to retrofit and will not interfere with air flow or generate secondary noise. AIVNC cancels ventilation noise by producing high fidelity, broadband counter-acoustic energy by means of very thin, flat multifrequency active patches under the control of an intelligent adapting module (IAM) based on a spontaneous adapting acoustic model.  In xxxxxx I POC demonstrated AIVNC with in-duct streamlined MAPs based on two piezoelectric materials, reproducing high-quality sound at up to 90 dB from 300 to 10000 Hz with very low distortion; a compact driving MAP amplifier; two IAM algorithms predicting ventilation noise one step ahead to cancel it, reducing noise by up to 27 dB rms with real xxxxxx ventilation noise provided by xxxxxx. In xxxxxx POC will advance/optimize AIVNC components to build a fully functional AIVNC prototype to reduce CQ noise by >30 dB, satisfying NC 40 requirements for xxxxxx crew quarters.	16275
Networked Communications and Speech System for Airspace System Assessments, Phase II	2015-06-01	2018-07-19	Extensive human-in-the-loop testing of xxxxxx concepts and technologies is typically required in a controlled lab environment before they can be integrated for evaluation in the field. The experiments tend to require the participation of a large number of subject-matter experts (SMEs) including air traffic controllers (ATC) and (pseudo-)pilots, which makes the experiments costly and the logistics with so many participants make them difficult to plan. These experiments often are designed only to collect data from either ATC or the pilots, but not both; the counterpart is needed only to provide realism in communication between them. The proposed research will develop a xxxxxx (SESIA) to replace the non-essential human subjects in these experiments. SESIA can interact with the SMEs through voice communication, and interface with the simulation platform to perform the intended control. It has the benefit of reduced cost associated with the experiments and increased convenience in their planning, thus allowing the opportunities to schedule additional testing. In cases where a pseudo-pilot would normally represent multiple flights and communicate to the ATC with the same voice for all flights, SESIA will actually increase the realism of the experiments by allow different voices to be synthesized to simulate different pilots.	16276
On The Performance Comparison of Gradient Type Joint-Process Est	2010-09-22	2018-07-19	In adaptive signal processing, joint process estimation playsan important role in various estimation problems. It is wellknown that a joint process estimator consists of two struc-tures, namely the orthogonalizer and the regression filter. Inliterature, orthogonalization step is performed either by or-thogonal transformations or by linear predictors. While theorthogonal transformations do not preserve entropy; thepredictors, such as the lattice, do preserve it. xxxxxxver, thesteady-state performance of such linear predictors is not asgood as those of the orthogonal transformations. xxxxxxticefilters do not perform perfect orthogonalization when theyoperate as gradient-based adaptive predictors. In this work,adaptive escalator predictor is proposed to be used as theorthogonalizer of the joint process estimator. The proposedmethod preserves the entropy and achieves perfect orthogo-nalization at all times. Moreover it has good steady-stateperformance compared to those structures utilizing gradientadaptive lattice filters.	16277
Payload Development for International Space Station (ISS) Experiment	2014-03-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxxdynamic xxxxxx (EDS) technology (an active dust mitigation/dust transport system to enable planetary exploration) was selected as one of the core experiments for the Materials xxxxxx X (MxxxxxxE-X) project. MxxxxxxE-X is an xxxxxx external platform designed to advance the xxxxxx of materials and devices for future space exploration. The purpose of the EDS MxxxxxxE-X experiment is to demonstrate operation of the EDS while exposed to the space environment (vacuum, full spectrum of solar radiation, solar wind flux, and cosmic rays). In the spring of 2013, the MxxxxxxE-X project was suspended while xxxxxx restructured the project's management approach. Soon after, we were selected as one of the experiments for the xxxxxx Test Program-xxxxxx 5 (STP-H5), a xxxxxx program for a xxxxxx Department of Defense xxxxxx experiment. STP-H5 is also an xxxxxx external platform to advance the xxxxxx of devices and materials. The EDS payload started to be modified to fit STPH-5 requirements. Experiment integration costs for STPH-5 are high and funding for participation of the EDS payload could not be obtained. The EDS Experiment pulled out of STP-H5 in November of 2013. We are now offereing the EDS as Government Suppied Equipment to the three partners in the xxxxxx CATALYST project. The Pacific International xxxxxx Exploration xxxxxxs (PISCES) has selectred the EDS as a payload for their lunar flight experiment and is working with the CATALYST partners to participate in their mission.	16278

Hierarchical Orbital Observatory Deployable Shroud (HOODS), Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Large deployable telescopes such as xxxxxx 9.2m and 16.8m segmented ATLAST systems require commensurately large deployable sunshades for thermal control and to prevent stray light from contaminating the desired science images. Existing deployable structures technologies are too heavy and expensive to provide advanced observation platforms with the supporting systems they require to function properly.xxxxxx and Bonded xxxxxx (ABS), xxxxxx. will team with QinetiQ xxxxxx xxxxxx (QNA) to provide xxxxxx with a versatile, self-deploying xxxxxxical Barrel Assembly (OBA) and shroud that can be applied to a wide range of telescope scales and configurations. The HOODS system consists of a strain energy self-deploying composite truss structure and the insulation and light baffle material that protects the sensitive optical components.The phase I program will define an OBA architecture compatible with the ATLAST overall system deployment and operational approach. The ABS team will build a representative section of deployable truss structure and test it in a laboratory environment. The test results will be used to extrapolate the full system performance. xxxxxx will expand on the xxxxxx I results to develop a scaled full system HOODS system prototype.	16280
Next Generation Advanced Binder Chemistries for High Performance, Environmentally DurableThermal Control Material Systems, Phase II	2006-11-01	2018-07-19	This innovative xxxxxx xxxxxx proposal will develop next generation products for Thermal Control Material xxxxxxs (TCMS) an adhesives based on the next generation nano-cluster chemistry based new binder systems, through the systematic investigations to tailor required unique performance properties with reliability and durability.

The proposed efforts will generate needed validation data to generate the confidence in the developed products and will carry out needed optimization of the proposed products.  It will also provide needed input to xxxxxx opportunities to the mission officials from JIMO, xxxxxx and to the various officials of DoD and NRO on the issues, where the next generation materials can make a significant difference.	16281
Adaptive Electric Propulsion for ISRU Missions, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxxdeless Lorentz Force xxxxxx (ELF-160A) has the ability to efficiently ionize and electromagnetically accelerate a variety of propellants over a broad range of specific impulses from 1,000-6,000 seconds. The ELF-160A thruster creates a high-density, magnetized plasmoid known as a Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) employing a Rotating xxxxxxic Field (RMF). The RMF driven azimuthal currents, coupled with the enhanced axial magnetic field gradient produced by the FRC inside the flux preserving conical thruster, produce a large axial JxBr force that accelerates the plasmoid to high velocity.The ELF-160A is completely electrodeless, the propellant is magnetically isolated from the thruster body, quasi-neutral, and there is zero contact between high temperature propellant and the thruster. xxxxxxd with a high ionization efficiency and rapid formation and ejection sequence, the ELF can operate on any gaseous propellant, and do so with a very long lifetime and with low thruster specific mass. The AFOSR-funded 200 kW ELF thruster was designed and testing using xxxxxx, pure xxxxxx, and xxxxxx as its primary propellants and demonstrated no life limiting or erosion issues. The xxxxxx developed 1kW class xxxxxxxxxxxxic Plasmoid xxxxxx (EMPT) demonstrated steady operation on a variety of propellant with over 100 Hrs of operation.The focus of this proposal is to take the results from the ELF and EMPT programs and develop a new 30 kW-class thruster that is capable of long duration operation on any gaseous propellant. xxxxxx I will develop the new systems required to transition this technology to a 30 kW, thermally stable, high temperature thruster and PPU system.	16282
Lunar Sulfur Capture System, Phase II	2011-01-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxture xxxxxx (LSCS) is an innovative method to capture greater than 90 percent of sulfur gases evolved during thermal treatment of lunar soils. LSCS sorbents are based on lunar soil iron compounds that trap sulfur contained in hot in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) product gases. Small amounts of polishing sorbents are used as needed to reduce equilibrium sulfur concentrations to the ppm or sub-ppm level. The LSCS is an effective technology for protecting in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) hardware from damage caused by the corrosive effects of hydrogen sulfide (xxxxxx) and other sulfur-containing gases. Saturated sorbents can be regenerated for reuse, and desorbed sulfur can be converted to elemental sulfur. xxxxxx process steps include bulk xxxxxx capture on lunar soil, further capture of xxxxxx on polishing sorbent, regeneration of soil sorbent for re-use, recovery of high-purity xxxxxx, and conversion of xxxxxx to elemental sulfur. The LSCS reduces the risk of using xxxxxxbased sorbents for primary sulfur capture by ensuring a ready supply of sorbent in the event of poor regeneration performance or process upset. The LSCS primary sulfur sorbent can be used as a non-regenerable sorbent if necessary without significant consequence to the ISRU process.	16283

GALILEO NIMS SPECTRAL IMAGE CUBES: JUPITER OPERATIONS	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	The natural form of imaging spectrometer data is the spectral image cube. It is normally in band sequential format, but has a dual nature. It is a series of 'images' of the target, each in a different wavelength, in ascending order. It is also a set of spectra, each at a particular line and sample, over the target area. Each spectrum describes a small portion of the area. When transformed into cubes, the data may be analyzed spatially, an image at a time, or spectrally, a spectrum at a time, or in more complex spatial-spectral fashion.	16285

Luminit Optical Tank-level Sensing System, Phase I	2012-02-01	2018-07-19	To address the xxxxxx need for innovative methods to measure liquid propellant tank volume and tank fluid level with improved accuracy, repeatability, and minimal tank entries for maintenance and calibration, xxxxxx, LLC, proposes to develop a new non-contact xxxxxx xxxxxxical xxxxxxk-level Sensing system (xxxxxx), based on the optical measurement of a small spotlight shone on the surface of the liquid.  This approach incorporates commercial off-the-shelf components and xxxxxx opto-mechanical design, which enables us to meet xxxxxx requirements for a novel liquid level sensor for low-density fluids such as liquid hydrogen, and offers the possibility of remote operation, compact size.  In xxxxxx I, xxxxxx will demonstrate the feasibility of accurate measurement of a low-density fluid by building and testing a proof-of-concept prototype, which will reduce development risk in xxxxxx.  In xxxxxx, xxxxxx plans to build a functional prototype for cryogenic liquid level measurements.  The demonstrated results will offer xxxxxx a replacement for the multiple float switches currently in use. xxxxxx is expected to be at xxxxxx 2 by the end of xxxxxx I, with the results of this project paving the way to reach xxxxxx 6 by the end of xxxxxx.	16290
Automated Flight Safety Inference Engine (AFSIE) System, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop an innovative Autonomous xxxxxx Safety Inference Engine (xxxxxxIE) system to autonomously and reliably terminate the flight of an errant launch vehicle. This proposed phase 1 research is innovative in that it combines proven xxxxxx-developed xxxxxx algorithms, real-time hazard assessment algorithms and hazard envelopes generated from Joint xxxxxxanced xxxxxx Safety xxxxxx Real Time (JARSS RT)  and an on-board vehicle simulator into a refined onboard software inference engine that monitors navigation states, mission flight rules and onboard anomaly instrumentation.  An autonomous flight safety system must be able to reliably perform accurate and autonomous navigation so as to determine the vehicle position, velocity and attitude states in real time. Reliability requirements for xxxxxx are high due to stringent loss-of-life constraints, often leading to redundant navigation sensors with attendant cost impacts. Our innovative solution proposes to satisfy xxxxxx accuracy and reliability requirements by exploiting the low-cost COTS sensor and processor architectures that are currently being baselined for the Common xxxxxxxxLauncher xxxxxx xxxxxx (Cxxxxxx) study and a xxxxxx launch vehicle avionics design. This dual use hardware implementation will greatly reduce the recurring costs for the production of an autonomous flight safety system.   This has significant implications for reducing the costs for launch vehicles, particularly xxxxxx and xxxxxx xxxxxx Launch Vehicles (NMSLV), where range safety costs currently consume a burdensome percentage of the launch cost.  Under this proposed phase 1 effort, we will 1) identify the range requirements and develop a plan for range safety for approval of the system, 2) identify reliable low-cost COTS hardware that satisfies the range accuracy and reliability requirements and, 3) develop an end to end simulation to demonstrate the xxxxxxIE Concept of Operations.	16291

An Investigation of Mechanisms in Bonding and Failure of Thermal Spray Coatings	2019-08-01	2018-07-19	The proposed project is an investigation of the mechanisms in bonding and failure of thermal spray coatings. The objectives for this project are as follows: establish an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for bonding, including metallurgical bonding and mechanical interlocking, and understand the mechanisms that dominate during coating failure. Understanding of bonding mechanisms will allow for optimization of the coating process to increase the strength of coatings as well as production of new combinations of coatings and substrates. Understanding the failure mechanisms of coatings allows one to tailor microstructures and optimize pre and post treatments to optimize coating performance. This investigation will be conducted through several steps. First is characterizing coating/substrate systems' stress state and dislocation densities using nanoindentation, electron backscatter and diffraction. xxxxxxond is by inducing coating failure by several methods: surface indentation, interface indentation, and tensile testing. Characterizing the failed states and then comparing with initial states will provide insight into the aforementioned mechanisms. Finally, a cohesive zone finite element model will be utilized to model these behaviors and predict failure under different starting states. This project holds great significance to xxxxxx because of the large requirements for specially engineered materials. Though the investigation is not explicitly creating a new kind of coating, it holds significance to the application of all coatings, including established and as yet undeveloped coatings.	16297

Modeling, Calibration and Control for Extreme-Precision MEMS Deformable Mirrors, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx AO will develop electromechanical models and actuator calibration methods to enable open-loop control of MEMS deformable mirrors (DMs) with unprecedented precision. xxxxxx budget analysis will establish feasibility of open-loop operation with nanometer-scale positioning accuracy and sub-nanometer resolution and stability. xxxxxxhough a number of MEMS based DMs have been demonstrated for adaptive optics applications, little work has been carried out to characterize their wavefront correction ability to precisions required by xxxxxx space telescope missions. This proposal directly addresses this issue for a class of electrostatically actuated DMs with extremely high optical quality and low voltage-to-stroke ratios. High-precision, large actuator count DMs are critical for high-contrast astrophysical imagers, including the Terrestrial xxxxxxet Finder program. Existing non-MEMS DMs that approach xxxxxx requirements feature high actuation voltages, low actuator densities and uncertain scalability beyond a few thousand actuators. MEMS DMs offer natural scalability, but do not yet meet the stringent precision and stability requirements for space telescopes applications. Better understanding of the electromechanical behavior, positioning error sources and calibration methods for these devices is essential to understand and improve performance, bringing MEMS DMs to mission readiness.	16302

3D High Density mmWave Interconnects, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Nuvotronics has developed and optimized the PolyStrataTM process for the fabrication of intricate microwave and millimeter-wave devices.  These devices have primarily been rectangular coaxial transmission lines, although rectangular waveguide and other structures have also been demonstrated.  Intricate devices have been demonstrated with insertion loss 5 to 10 times lower than traditional planar circuits; isolation better than 60dB for lines that share separating walls; multiple levels of densely-packed coaxial circuits; and low-parasitic attachment to active devices and traditional circuit boards.

Lightweight Light Sail Propulsion	2013-06-01	2018-07-19	The areal density of solar sails and laser sails is large due to the heavy support structure made of Mylar, xxxxxx or CP-1. Replacing this support structure with graphene essentially eliminates this mass resulting in a 87% weight savings compared to traditional solar sails, given that graphene is one-atom thick. This weight savings allows for more payload mass, greater acceleration or a combination of the two.  This project will investigate if graphene can be used as the solar sail support structure and if significant improvements in areal density can be achieved.  The objective of the project is to show feasibility of fabricating light sails by coating a thin layer of metal on a graphene support structure to obtain low area density sails.  xxxxxx is a single atom thick layer of carbon which is invisible to the naked eye. It often comes on a metal substrate such as nickel or copper.  The graphene will be characterized by using xxxxxx to determine the quality and coverage of the surface.  Our approach will use the substrate as a support structure by covering the metal on the edges so the middle section is etched away when it is suspended in the etchant, leaving a free graphene layer suspended in air.  This graphene will then be coated with a thin layer of metal by sputter coating a 100 or 50 nm thick layer.  Another approach will be to first sputter coat the metal and them etch away the nickel or copper substrate.  The edges of the substrate will be covered by tape and the middle section will be etched away.  Low areal density solar sails could enable interstellar probes, which investigate exo-planets for life and human habitability.  The nanosystems, which would be the by-product of the solar sails, could enable not only many benefits for space technology but also could help spur forward the nanotechnology revolution, bringing forward many economic benefits.  Future work will consist of developing low areal density sails with high-reflectivity and high-temperature optimized to enable the highest possible acceleration both for solar and laser sails. Both methods were attempted and the second method enabled us to fabricate the sail.  Some of the challenges found in the process was the surface tension in the etchant which tended to pull on the graphene causing it to break away from the substrate and float on the surface.  xxxxxx typically has many cracks and imperfections which we believe enabled the material to separate away coupled with the chemical process.  After modifying the approach, we were able to make some sail samples which we tested using xxxxxx.  The metal sail layer does shield out the xxxxxx signature of the graphene so verification of the graphene was not completely possible since the signature was shielded out, but some evidence was apparent.  An attempt was made to use AFM to verify that the graphene layer exists and supports the metal layer, but technical issues with the xxxxxx force microscopy (AFM) prevented us from obtaining results.  xxxxxx-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) was used to quantify the optical transmissivity at various wavelengths, which was very low at about 2%.  The optical reflectometer  was not operational due to a recent failure in the system, so no true values on reflectivity were obtained.  Once this equipment is operational, testing will be conducted on the reflectance of the material.  The work is significant because it lays the groundwork for interstellar precursor missions for human exploration.	16305

A Real-Time Quantitative Condition Alerting and Analysis Support System for Aircraft Maintenance, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	"Financial constraints and the need for improved operational efficiency are requiring airlines to emphasize \"on-condition\" maintenance over scheduled maintenance where possible.  xxxxxxver, many of the specific conditions and events of interest to airline maintenance are not being monitored by automatic systems.  Some of these events are detected through a subjective determination by the aircrew.  This subjective determination can result in both maintenance being performed unnecessarily and maintenance not being performed when needed.  AeroTech will develop a multi-tier, Quantitative Condition Alerting and xxxxxx Support (Q-CAAS) system for aircraft that will in real-time, automatically downlink to maintenance personnel, reports on the occurrence of specific conditions and events (e.g. loads exceedance).  The reports will be displayed on a web based, ground station network.  The system will also track individual aircraft's exposure to particular in-flight conditions allowing airline personnel to tailor maintenance programs to individual aircraft.  By providing quantifiable data in real-time, operational decisions can be made to minimize the impact and maximize the benefits of on-condition maintenance.  The Q-CAAS system will be comprised only of software that can be implemented on most current fleet aircraft, keeping costs low, minimizing the time to market, and therefore maximizing the likelihood of industry adoption."	16312

Sensitivity-Based Simulation Software for Optimization of Turbine Blade Cooling Strategies, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	In recent years, there has been a tendency to use ever-higher gas turbine inlet temperatures, resulting in ever-higher heat loads necessitating efficient cooling. Internal cooling designs have evolved from the use of simple curved ducts in early designs to very complex geometries. Similar complexities govern film cooling as well, leading to complex fluid-structure interactions and turbulence physics. These complexities make it impossible to obtain optimal cooling designs by intuition alone. In this project we propose to develop optimization software for the design and optimization of turbine blade cooling strategies. The objectives of xxxxxx I are to (i) demonstrate the feasibility of accurate single-point physical modeling of internal and film cooling geometries using our CFD solver TETHYS, (ii) demonstrate the feasibility of sensitivity computation and uncertainty quantification using  TETHYS, (iii) apply these sensitivity and uncertainty quantification approaches to turbine blade cooling and to demonstrate their advantage over single-point CFD simulations, and (iv) develop and demonstrate multivariate optimization of a chosen turbine blade cooling problem. xxxxxx will extend our methodology to geometry optimization, the improvement of physical models and numerical schemes, parallel processing on shared and distributed memory platforms and multicore architectures, as well as application to more complex optimization problems.	16327

LUNAR TERRAIN AND ALBEDO RECONSTRUCTION FROM APOLLO IMAGERY	2010-10-13	2018-07-19	LUNAR TERRAIN AND ALBEDO RECONSTRUCTION FROM xxxxxxIMAGERYARA V NEFIAN*, TAEMIN KIM**, MICHAEL BROXTON**, AND ZACH MORATTO**Abstract. xxxxxxrating accurate three dimensional planetary models and albedo maps is becomingincreasingly more important as xxxxxx plans more robotics missions to the xxxxxx in the comingyears. This paper describes a novel approach for separation of topography and albedo mapsfrom orbital xxxxxx images. Our method uses an optimal xxxxxxian correlator to refine the stereodisparity map and generate a set of accurate digital elevation models (DEM). The albedo mapsare obtained using a multi-image formation model that relies on the derived DEMs and the xxxxxx-xxxxxx reflectance model. The method is demonstrated on a set of high resolution scannedimages from the xxxxxx era missions.	16329

Retroreflector Array for Test Environments (RATE), Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxearch Support xxxxxxents, xxxxxx. (RSI) proposes to develop the Retroreflector Array for Test Environments (RATE), an innovative technology that will non-intrusively measure pressure on aerodynamic surfaces in xxxxxx ground test facilities with high sensitivity and bandwidth.  The signal from RATE units will change locally due to pressure changes.  Pressure sensitive paints, in comparison, have serious drawbacks: they must applied to a rigid surface, are specific to the flow species, and do not retroreflect.  Because RATE will be independent of the flow species, and applied as a very thin, flexible, adhesive material, it will be able to measure the aerodynamic pressure while minimizing changes in the flow field.  The xxxxxx I RATE program will involve design, fabrication, and test of various candidate designs in order to select the most promising approach for xxxxxx.  RSI will use its experience in microfabricated structures and pressure sensors to employ a highly innovative technology in order to non-intrusively measure aerodynamic pressure in xxxxxx ground test facilities.  The result will be a product that will address a critical xxxxxx instrumentation need.	16331

This requires robotic explorers capable of operation and survivability in high-temperature/high-pressure environment to service the needs of the future in situ exploration of xxxxxx as well as atmospheric probes for giant planets. This program will design a xxxxxx probe thermal management system capable of sustaining operation for 20 hours or more. To support the design, new thermal management technologies will be evaluated and considered for use the harsh xxxxxxian environment.	16333
Spacecraft Fire Safety Demonstration	2020-12-01	2018-07-19	The objective of the xxxxxx Fire Safety Demonstration project is to develop and conduct large-scale fire safety experiments on xxxxxx resupply vehicle after it leaves the xxxxxx and before it re-enters the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Three xxxxxx Fire Experiment (xxxxxx) flight units were developed and have flown on three sequential flights of xxxxxx ATK&#39;s Cygnus re-supply vehicle. xxxxxx-I was launched on OA-6 in xxxxxxh 2016, xxxxxx-II on OA-5 in October 2016, and xxxxxx-xxxxxx on OA-7 in xxxxxxh 2017.&nbsp; The xxxxxx-I, II, and xxxxxx experiments were all operated successfully in xxxxxxe 2016, November 2016, and xxxxxxe 2017, respectively. Three more xxxxxx experiments, xxxxxx-IV-VI, are now being developed to continue to investigate material flammability risks that will be faced by the crew on xxxxxx&#39;s long duration exploration missions, especially at reduced pressure and higher oxygen concentrations. These experiments will also obtain data on large-scale spacecraft fire detection, monitoring, and post-fire cleanup&nbsp;as well as obtain valuable data to allow spacecraft designers and engineers to predict the development of fire scenarios in exploration vehicles and habitats. The SFS Demo Project is managed by xxxxxx xxxxxx (GRC) who also developed the design and fabricated the hardware. xxxxxx from xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxflight Center and the xxxxxx xxxxxx Test Facility were also instrumental in fabricating and testing the xxxxxx hardware. The xxxxxx team is augmented by an international topical team assembled by the European xxxxxx Agency (ESA). Each member of this team brings expertise and funding from their respective space and research agencies for their activities. The experiment hardware for xxxxxx-I-VI is approximately 53 cm x 90 cm x 133 cm and consists of a flow duct, containing the sample material to be burned, fans, and flow straightener, and an avionics bay, containing the power management system, control computer, signal conditioning card, and cameras. xxxxxx-I and xxxxxx had a single large sample (0.4 m x 0.9 m) made of a composite fabric (75% cotton/25% fiberglass by mass) that has been studied in previous low-gravity experiments although using much smaller samples. This sample burned completely during the tests and yielded information about the fate (flame size and spread rate) of a large-scale fire in low-gravity. xxxxxx-II had nine samples (xxxxxx wide x 30-cm long) of various materials that were selected to investigate the low-gravity xxxxxximum xxxxxx Concentration (MOC) flammability limits in long-term low gravity. These samples emulate the configuration used in xxxxxx-STD-6001 Test 1, the flammability test conducted in normal gravity to determine if a flame will spread upward over the sample or if it will self-extinguish. A material that self-extinguishes is considered as being safe for use in spacecraft from the standpoint of flammability. To conduct the xxxxxx experiments, the xxxxxx hardware is loaded in the Cygnus Pressurized Cargo xxxxxx by xxxxxx ATK and launched from xxxxxx. Once at xxxxxx, xxxxxx&nbsp;remains unpowered on Cygnus while supplies for the xxxxxx are off-loaded by the crew. Once supplies are off-loaded and replaced with trash, Cygnus departs. When the vehicle reaches a safe distance from the xxxxxx,&nbsp;xxxxxx will be powered on by a team of xxxxxx ATK and xxxxxx engineers working from xxxxxx ATK&#39;s xxxxxx Control Center in xxxxxx, VA. After conducting system checks, Cygnus will be put into free drift and the experiment initiated. xxxxxx-I, II, and xxxxxx ran autonomously for about 2-1/2 hours. With the expanded objectives of xxxxxx-IV-VI, the experiment will require about 8 hours to be completed. When the experiment is complete, Cygnus continues to orbit the earth while the data is downlinked to various ground stations. When downlink is complete, Cygnus will then begin its reentry into the Earth&#39;s atmosphere where it will burn-up over the Pacific Ocean. The design for the xxxxxx-IV-VI experiments is complete and the units are being fabricated to be&nbsp;followed by extensive ground testing to verify operation. xxxxxx-IV is scheduled to be launched in October 2019, with xxxxxx-V and VI following in February and May of 2020.	16334
Exposure of zebrafish larvae to relative microgravity between 5-6 days post-fertilization	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	The general objective of the study was to determine modulation of gene expression by environmental factors with a special emphasis on bone formation. For this reason the specific period of treatment was chosen between 5-6 days post-fertilization (dpf) when bone formation and calcification are taking place. This experiment was designed as a new type of gravitational experiment which we like to call relative microgravity referring to the fact that the larvae first grow in hyper gravity for 5 days and are then returned to 1g normal gravity for 1 day. xxxxxxfish embryos were placed on a xxxxxx at 3 hpf brought to a gravitational force of 3 g until 5 dpf. xxxxxxence embryos were kept in parallel at 1g (xxxxxx). At 5dpf one batch was left at 3g (3g) one batch was returned to 1g (3g>1g) while a third batch was returned to 1g but left on the axis of the centrifuge (Axe; 3g>Axe). The experiment was repeated 4 times each time with 4 batches of 60 larvae.	16335

ROSETTA-ORBITER CHECK GIADA 2 CR2 CRUISE2 V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	This volume contains Experiment xxxxxx acquired by xxxxxx during 'Cruise 2' phase. More in detail it refers to the data provided during the following in-flight tests: 'Passive xxxxxx xxxxxx n. 1' (PC1) held on 02/03-10-2005; 'Passive xxxxxx xxxxxx n. 2' (PC2) held on 05/06-03-2006. It also contains documentation which describes the xxxxxx experiment. The data reported in this data set have been converted from ADC counts to engineering values. The quality of the Housekeeping and xxxxxx data is good. xxxxxxentific data are due to noise, as no grain event is expected during this mission phase. These data must be only considered to evaluate xxxxxx behaviour and not as real scientific data. xxxxxx reported by GDS and IS are due to noise as no dust event is expected during this mission phase. MBS frequency changes, once normalised for frequency vs. temperature dependence, if present, are due to deposition of contaminants existing in the S/C environment. Housekeeping and xxxxxx data from all xxxxxx sub-systems are useful to evaluate instrument health and behaviour when compared with similar data acquired during other mission phases.	16337
High Efficiency Direct Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System, Phase II	2017-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx has a defined need for energy dense and highly efficient energy storage and power delivery systems for future space missions.  Compared to other fuel cell technologies, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) based systems are better suited to meeting xxxxxx efficiency targets while operating directly on methane and oxygen reactants.  SOFC power systems for lunar landers and other exploration vehicles are an ideal application for this technology, as well as for power generation on the moon or on xxxxxx.  NexTech Materials has established SOFC technology that offers high power density with direct internal fuel reforming and high single-pass fuel utilization, making it uniquely suited for achieving xxxxxx performance and efficiency requirements.  In xxxxxx I of this project, NexTech designed a methane/oxygen SOFC system and established a process model, designed the stack and hot box for this system, and completed testing to validate that the target efficiency of 70 percent was achievable.  In xxxxxx of this project, NexTech will specify and source all system components, build a three-dimensional CAD model of the methane/oxygen SOFC system, build and test 1-kW scale stacks of the xxxxxx I design, demonstrate 70 percent electrical efficiency in a stack with only methane and oxygen reactant feeds, and evaluate long term durability and thermal cycling capability of the stack.	16338

Venus Interior Probe Using In-situ Power and Propulsion (VIP-INSPR), Phase II	2019-03-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx, despite being our closest neighboring planet, is under-explored due to its hostile environment. The atmosphere is composed primarily of xxxxxx, with a 92 bar pressure and 467°C temperature at the surface. The temperature decreases at higher altitudes, approaching conditions similar to that of xxxxxx surface at 65km. Due to more moderate conditions above 50 km, balloon missions have survived as long as 46 h at an altitude of 54 km. xxxxxxver, due to the opacity of the xxxxxx atmosphere, orbital/balloon observations at such altitudes are not capable of characterizing the surface. The recent decadal survey for xxxxxx (2013-2022) and VEXAG study (2014) emphasized the need to gather basic information on the crust, mantle, core, atmosphere/exosphere and bulk composition of xxxxxx through in situ investigations, using low-altitude aerial platforms or land probes. The hostile conditions prevalent at low altitudes and on the surface of xxxxxx have limited the low-altitude aerial or surface missions to a few hours (xxxxxxn Venera landers <2 h), due mainly to the lack of adequate thermal resilience of electronics and power sources. Since photovoltaic and nuclear power sources are currently inapplicable at low altitudes, there is a crucial need for new long-lasting power technology concepts to enable extended low-altitude aerial missions.We propose to develop a novel xxxxxx Interior xxxxxx Using In-situ xxxxxx and Propulsion (VIP-INSPR) architecture for sustained xxxxxx atmospheric exploration. The probe utilizes H2 and O2, harvested through electrolysis of sulfuric acid/water to supplement fuel carried from Earth, in order to supply a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) for power generation at low altitudes, and to supplement H2 as a buoyancy gas for the ascent/descent of a balloon. The major components include: i) A high temperature reversible SOFC, ii) Chemical hydride for H2 storage, iii) A H2 buoyancy-based altitude control system, and iv) A solar array, to generate power in the upper atmosphere. A solar array will power the probe at high altitude and the SOFC will provide power at low altitudes using H2 and O2 carried from Earth. Both H2 and O2 will be regenerated through electrolysis of the water produced in the fuel cell (a closed–system) at high altitudes. Additionally, these reactants will be replenished by electrolyzing either xxxxxxO4 or xxxxxx harvested from the xxxxxx atmosphere at high altitudes to compensate for the loss of H2 from the balloon and/or water from the fuel cell. This novel architecture enables generation of fuel from in-situ resources at high altitudes, power at low altitudes, and transport gas for the balloon. In contrast to earlier xxxxxx probes, our xxxxxx probe is designed to survive the range of hostile environments on xxxxxx without the need for thermal management. Cycling between high and low altitudes (e.g., 65k to 15km), the probe can be utilized as a long duration low-altitude aerial platform for xxxxxx exploration. This would enable new scientific studies on the xxxxxx inner atmosphere and surface geology using advanced analytical and imaging techniques.The component technologies used here, i.e., metal hydrides, SOFC and a high-temperature solar array, have terrestrial relevance and will enable a new mission paradigm for xxxxxx exploration. In xxxxxx-1, we formulated the requirements of the component technologies and identified the materials based on thermal stability and performance. We have established an appropriate protocol for the lowaltitude and high-altitude transitions of the probe and developed a preliminary design for a 150kg balloon. In xxxxxx, we will continue this development, focusing on key aspects relevant to a broader range of missions, identifying and advancing enabling technologies and developing a technology road map for incorporation in future xxxxxx missions. We expect maturation of this concept at the end of the project to xxxxxx 3.	16340
Miniature Sample Collection and Delivery System using Gas-Entrained Powder Transport, Phase I	2008-08-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop a miniature system for acquisition and delivery of solid samples to landed planetary instruments. This system would entrain powder produced by drilling in atmospheric gas. The powder / gas mixture would be transported to a sample chamber, where the powder would sedimented out. The key innovations of this system are:- The sample collector doubles as a sample holder for delivery to on-board instrumentation. This reduces the risk of cross-contamination.- The small size and power requirements of the complete system would make powdered sample collection available to smaller planetary missions.	16341
Novel Fabrication of Nano Device for Single DNA/Protein Detection, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	The health of the astronauts during space flight is critical to the success of xxxxxx?s space program.  xxxxxxs are exposed to tremendous environmental challenges, such as cosmic radiation, microgravity and confined space.  Their immune systems are easily compromised.  To study these effects, biomarkers such as nucleic acids and protein are measured to determine how the body reacts and adjusts to the stresses.  Current detection methods rely on traditional molecular techniques that are time-consuming and require skillful operators.  Also, the equipment needed is bulky and require high-power consumption.  Therefore, many measurements are not conducted near real time but are completed after the samples are frozen and returned to earth.  This leads to uncertainty on the reliability of the data.  In order to overcome these problems, Lynntech proposes a novel method to fabrication a nano-electronic biochip that potentially can provide single DNA/protein detection in near real time.  The proposed biochip will be more sensitive, smaller, more reliable, lower cost, and easier to operate for xxxxxx?s mission than the most commonly used optical methods.  The ultimate goal is to develop a small real-time nucleic acid and protein detection biochip capable of conducting measurements for long duration space missions.	16342

Novel, Nanotechnology Based CMC composites for Hot Structures, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	Very extensive R&D efforts over the past several decades resulted in several classes of high temperature composites offering potential for future hypersonic vehicles hot structures.  Of particular interest is a hybrid carbon/xxxxxx matrix composite utilizing carbon fiber.  This class of composite, which utilizes Phenolic prepreg to form the initial composite structure, lends itself to the fabrication of large very complex structures.  Typically, these composites are densified via PIP processing.  xxxxxxver, there are deficiencies in this material system.  The nature of PIP processing results in an appreciable amount of open porosity, requiring a CVD xxxxxx external coating for oxidation protection.  The application of CVD xxxxxx to large structures is quite limited due to cost factors.   Also, since the composites are fabricated using 2D fabric, the transverse mechanical properties are typically low.   This proposal offers a highly innovative approach to alleviate the above mentioned shortcomings.  First, it utilizes nanotechnology at the composite molding stage, enabling enhanced in plane and transverse mechanical properties.  xxxxxxondly, it offers a highly unique, non CVD external coating technology.  It enables the fabrication of large, complex parts with greatly reduced manufacturing cost when compared with conventional CVD xxxxxx.	16344

Rapid Hydrogen and Methane Sensors for Wireless Leak Detection, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Under xxxxxx STTR NNK07EA39C, ASR&D developed passive surface acoustic wave (SAW) based hydrogen sensors that utilize Pd nanocluster films on self-assembled siloxane monolayers to provide rapid, reversible room temperature responses to hydrogen exposure.  Under xxxxxx xxxxxx NNX09CE49P ASR&D demonstrated wireless interrogation of SAW RFID sensor-tags.  In this project, we propose to combine the results of these two technology development programs to produce wireless, uniquely identifiable SAW-based hydrogen sensors, and to evaluate the sensor response time to low levels of hydrogen exposure (down to 1 ppm).  ASR&D will also implement a SAW-based in-situ Pd deposition monitor for enhanced film reproducibility.  ASR&D's previous hydrogen work was based on xxxxxxne xxxxxxs work with similar films that demonstrated hydrogen sensing from 25 ppm to over 2% hydrogen, with response times of milliseconds, complete reversibility, and no baseline drift at room temperature.  ASR&D demonstrated the ability to measure changes in such films using a SAW sensor, however our ability to test at low hydrogen concentrations and at rates exceeding 1 sample/sec were limited by our experimental test equipment.  In the proposed effort, we will utilize an Environics gas dilution system to generate calibrated gas concentrations (for hydrogen and methane) down to 1 ppm, and we will utilize the electronic interrogation system being developed for our RFID work to measure the sensors.  This system is capable of measuring sensor responses with a good S/N in 1 msec (or less), overcoming the prior limitations of our testbench equipment.  In addition to the hydrogen sensor work, working with Temple xxxxxxersity, we propose to evaluate the technical feasibility of producing SAW-based methane sensors using a similar SAW sensor device, but incorporating methane selective supramolecular cryptophane films.  xxxxxx sensors will be xxxxxx4 at completion of the proposed effort, and methane sensors will be xxxxxx 3.	16346

Physics-Based Conceptual Design Flying Qualities Analysis using OpenVSP and VSPAero, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx?s OpenVSP tool suite provides a common parametrically driven geometry model formany different analyses for aircraft and is primarily used in the conceptual design phase. The current 3.5.1 release currently contains significant gaps when assessing handling qualities for a particular configuration forcing the engineer to rely on historical methods with limited applicability to advanced technology design concepts with unconventional configurations.  In the proposed effort, ESAero will develop an integrated workflow within the OpenVSP suite for quantitative assessment of handling qualities enabling the engineer to explore new design spaces with unconventional configurations.  Along with this workflow a set of pre-requisite tasks to improve the system modeling capabilities will be completed as well.  These efforts include: improving flight control surface modeling, improved mass properties representation for generic components, a new aerodynamic trim solver, a new vehicle dynamics model calculation, and a new parameter sweep capability to tie geometry to quantitative physics base handling qualities.  These efforts will also lay the ground work for follow on studies of high lift aerodynamics and closed loop flight control.  The proposed efforts are designed to complement the existing and active OpenVSP and VSPxxxxxx development efforts.	16348

Solid State Energy Conversion for Deep Space Power	2018-01-01	2018-07-19	Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) devices employed in static radioisotope generators show great promise for highly efficient, reliable, and resilient power generation for deep space missions. Long-wavelength TPVs would require lower-temperature heat sources, leading to reduced thermal stress on equipment and a better harvesting of the thermal source spectrum. xxxxxxver, these devices demand new materials with smaller bandgaps, materials that cannot be grown due to miscibility gaps or have yet to be grown without debilitating crystalline defects. To increase the potential for TPV technologies, my research focuses on the epitaxial growth of xxxxxx-V semiconducting compounds composed of bismuth for long-wavelength TPV applications, allowing for a greater ubiquity to heat harvesting and power generation systems. I will use both analytical and empirical tools to enable the success of my endeavor: modeling both global and local strain using Silvaco TCAD to understand the physics of the growth process, as well as fabricating samples by molecular beam epitaxy to compare theory with experiment. Ultimately, I will build and test a full TPV generator implemented with a graphite heat source to analyze our devices' potential efficiency in static radioisotope power sources. Long-wavelength, low-temperature TPVs hold the power to revolutionize electricity generation in a wide variety of fields by providing a clean, long-lasting, and efficient method of producing power.	16350

Self-Regulating Capillary Flow Networks for Electrospray Micropropulsion Devices	2021-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxances in miniaturization of electronics and MEMS devices enable microsatellites and xxxxxx to perform tasks that previously required massive satellites. Low launch costs of these microsatellites will make existing applications cheaper and revolutionize access to space, leading to an explosion of diversity in orbital systems. But a reliable micropropulsion system is needed to allow xxxxxx to perform the same orbital maneuvers as traditional satellites, and even be used for swarming and deep-space missions.One promising technology is electrospray micropropulsion. Traditional large-scale electrospray propulsion induces an electric field with a negative electrode above the surface of a conductive propellant, causing emission of ions or droplets. It has been tested successfully in space on the xxxxxx xxxxxxfinder mission. xxxxxxspray micropropulsion miniaturizes this technology; the thrusters are so small and light that you could easily fit five or six in the palm of your hand. A leading design is external-flow microfluidic electrospray propulsion (MEP).Emission technology is advancing steadily, but a key roadblock is the development of a propellant management device (PMD) to regulate flow from storage to the emitters. The laws of fluid dynamics prevent large-scale PMDs with their pumps, valves, and pipes from working at the micro scale. xxxxxxment of effective micro PMDs is the final technological step required for the electrospray micropropulsion. We propose a novel self-healing microfluidic PMD, and the results of our research will be easily adaptable to other microfluidic projects such as lab-on-a-chip devices for extraplanetary or medical uses, focus beam spectrometers, electron microscopes, and milling devices. An earlier approach to micro PMDs relied on internal wicking, precluding fine control of the design or self-regulatory flow characteristics. Our proposed PMD will consistently and robustly feed propellant to the emitter, automatically adjust for varying emitter conditions, self-heal and resist perturbations, and avoid clogging. This can be accomplished by using external wicking instead of internal flow.xxxxxxhough internal and external capillary wicking are both related to surface tension, they are fundamentally different processes. Internal wicking (flow through a narrow pipe) is well understood. The enclosure forces the flux to be constant in space, so the fluid dynamics are governed by a single parameter (the distance the fluid has wicked) and local flow control is impossible.External wicking (capillary flow with a free surface, e.g. in a groove) is not well understood, but its complexity increases the possibilities for flow control. The existence of a free surface allows flux and local pressure to vary dynamically. And external groove flow is automatically self-healing: fluid avoids regions with too much propellant and flows to underfilled regions, making it a natural fit for PMDs.External flow is also controllable. Unlike internal flow, the free surface can couple both to the geometry of the substrate and external electromagnetic fields; hence flow can be precisely controlled at every point from start to end. This potential for extremely fine fluid control is not trivial; the highly nonlinear partial differential equations governing the dynamics are very difficult to solve. But with thorough analysis and numerical modeling, the power of free surface control can be unlocked.We have proposed designing an external-flow PMD specifically for the MEP. But rather than stop at designing a single PMD for a particular application, we also propose developing a comprehensive analytical and computational toolkit for self-regulating external flow networks. This toolkit will contain analogues of electronic components (resistors, capacitors, etc.) so that fluid management systems for various situations can quickly and easily be developed by considering analogous electronic circuitry.	16352
On laser sensor image fringe detection and mitigation in real-time processing based on firmware supported Hilbert-Huang Transform for 2-Dimensions	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	In physics, interference is a phenomenon in which two waves superimpose to form a new complex wave and fringes are observed wherever the two or more waves overlap. Fringe analysis has a wide range of applications in physical and engineering measurements interpretation and its state-of-the-art static processing is using linearity-assumed xxxxxx Transform that is inadequate due to fringe non-linear and non-stationary nature. This breakthrough technology for optical testbed verification experiments and fringe analysis, as well as phase unwrapping of spaceflight grade optical components and systems, is based on firmware supported dynamic near real-time xxxxxx for 2-dimensions (HHT2-Fringe). The image of a laser source through quartz substrate of the filter wheel or enclosure on the CCD detector is prone to unwanted interference fringes due to the impurities of quartz material. xxxxxxlying antireflection coatings on both sides of the substrate could substantially reduce these fringes but does not remove them completely. xxxxxxernatively, the interference fringes analogous to xxxxxx pattern could be removed statically using image processing after the in-situ measurement or dynamically while an experiment is in process. It&rsquo;s highly beneficial to eliminate these patterns dynamically using a near-real time processing. The benefit is due itself to the dynamic and nonlinear nature of these fringes where the beam source location could change at any angle. xxxxxxver, the static fringe analysis is using linearity-based xxxxxx Transforms and the dynamic fringe analysis techniques are in embryonic state.One innovative approach to detect and remove the unwanted fringes dynamically is by applying the combination of the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD2) and xxxxxx (HSA2) for 2-dimensions and specifically researching and developing the HHT2 into fringe detection and mitigation engineering tool HHT2-Fringe. The EMD2 and HSA2 comprise xxxxxx for 2-dimensions or HHT2 that was recently accomplished within the xxxxxx internal research and development program (IRAD). The HHT2 is designed specifically for analyzing data from nonlinear and non-stationary processes in 2-dimensions.	16353
Biomining of regolith simulants for biological in situ resource utilization, Phase I	2013-02-01	2018-07-19	The goal of this proposed research is to advance the development of biological in situ resource utilization for xxxxxx space exploration programs.  We plan to build a foundation to use synthetic biology to engineer microorganisms to extract metals from naturally occurring extraterrestrial regolith. We propose to create a novel growth medium designed to mimic the lunar regolith ice discovered at the south pole of the moon by the LCROSS mission.  We will develop a bioleaching column for this simulant to purify metals for consumable production in space.  We will characterize known biomining organisms to leach this simulant.  Finally we will study the biochemical processes taking place in the leaching of the regolith to be able to improve the metabolism of these organisms in the future.In addition, will produce a database of organisms involved in biomining on Earth and the geologies and substrates that they have been found on.  This database can be used as a tool to find undersampled mine sites that may contain novel organisms suitable for biomining in space.We then plan to develop a conceptual bioreactor which is designed to extract metals from regolith in space.  We will perform a trade study of the mass, productivity, cost and energy requirements of such a bioreactor.xxxxxxer phases of the research will involve characterization of the important enzymes involved in biomining in key organisms, adding to the limited existing knowledge of these pathways and leading to creation of a synthetic biological system for efficiently engineering them, which we will use to optimize these organisms for extracting relevant substrates in relevant space-settlement-like conditions. This further research will also include growth on xxxxxx-like simulant regoliths, as well as improvement of the bioreactor model in a series of increasingly durable and realistic prototypes that will undergo both physical and functional testing.	16354

Prediction of Unsteady Transonic Aerodynamics, Phase I	2011-08-01	2018-07-19	An accurate prediction of aero-elastic effects depends on an accurate prediction of the unsteady aerodynamic forces. Perhaps the most difficult speed regime is transonic where the motion of the shock wave and its interaction with the boundary layer are dominant factors. In spite of over 40 years research into the computation of unsteady transonic aerodynamics there still appear to be areas where available technology is inadequate. A research axiom is that if a particular viewpoint fails to resolve an issue then the problem should be viewed differently. The research proposed here is to re-examine some issues in unsteady transonic aerodynamics using some recent theoretical developments. All aspects of unsteady transonic flow, including limit cycles and control strategies will be considered.	16357
1015 PTT Segment MEMS DM Development, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology has the potential to create deformable mirrors (DM) with more than 10^4 actuators with size, weight, and power specifications that are far lower than conventional piezoelectric and electrostrictive DMs. xxxxxxver, considerable development is necessary to take state-of-the-art MEMS DMs and make them flight-like for wavefront control in coronagraphs for exoplanet detection. This xxxxxx I research proposal will begin development of a 1015-segment MEMS DM. It will result in a completed CAD layout of the DM, a conceptual package design, a conceptual electrical probe card design, and the fabrication of a key layer in the actuator process to demonstrate high-resolution field-stitched photolithography. The ultimate goal is to develop flight-like hardware based on xxxxxx AO's proven hybrid MEMS DM technology. The increased spatial resolution afforded by the development here will enable picometer resolution DMs required to reach 10^10 contrast levels necessary for direct detection of xxxxxxsized terrestrial planets.	16358

High-Power Density SOFCs for Aviation Applications, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	As solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) approach commercialization, interest in broader applications of this technology is mounting.  While the first commercialized systems are being designed to provide 3-5 kW in stationary and automotive auxiliary power unit (APU) applications, aerospace and military users are considering integrating SOFCs into larger, airborne systems with considerable commercial payback.  SOFCs are aligned to displace inefficient, noisy, and polluting technologies such as diesel generators that will provide both economic and environmental motivation to prospective users.  NexTech Materials will develop a solid oxide fuel cells that demonstrate high power density, targeting 2W/cm2, a level of performance that will enable the compact, lightweight systems required for aerospace applications to become a reality.  Such high power density SOFCs will provide the bridge from stationary residential power systems to airborne auxiliary power units.  The fuel cells that result from these applications will lead the way to efficient and clean aircraft.  This xxxxxx I work will focus on processing and evaluating highly conductive electrolyte and electrode materials and the incorporation of these materials into high power density, SOFC cells suitable for commercial stack fabrication in xxxxxx.	16360

Optical Real-Time Space Radiation Monitor, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	Real-time dosimetry is needed to provide immediate feedback, so astronauts can minimize their exposure to ionizing radiation during periods of high solar activity.   xxxxxxical radiation monitors provide continuous detection of e- and n.  Radiation induced changes in the optical properties of each sensor's active material are interpreted via software to estimate the dose from each type of particle. Compared to traditional scintillation detectors, Luna's radiation monitors are more compact and better able to identify particle types.  Luna's unique sensor design and detection capabilities enable estimation of the energy and direction of the most energetic particles.  xxxxxxanced optical radiation monitors are also less prone to the radiation induced degradation that plagues diode dosimeters.	16362
Real-time Estimation of UAS Performance Using Efficient Sampling of Functional Models, Phase I	2012-08-01	2018-07-19	Numerica proposes to developed advanced algorithms for constructing a UAS vehicle model from ATC surveillance data in real-time. Using functional descriptions of aircraft performance and computationally efficient sampling techniques, UAS model parameters are estimated, and aircraft maneuvers that best improve these estimates are determined.	16363
Low-Stress Iridium Coatings for Thin-Shell X-Ray Telescopes, Phase II	2011-12-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop and commercialize a new type of low-stress iridium (Ir) X-ray mirror coating technology that can be used for the construction of high-resolution X-ray telescopes comprising thin-shell mirror substrates, such as the xxxxxx Mirror Array (FMA) currently being developed for the IXO mission.  The urgent need for low-stress Ir coating technology is driven by the current limitations on telescope angular resolution resulting from substrate distortions caused by conventional reflective Ir coatings that typically have very high stress.  In particular, we have measured film stresses in excess of 4 GPa in the case of Ir films deposited by conventional magnetron sputtering.  It is thought that the distortions in the thin glass mirror shells (such as those proposed for the IXO FMA) resulting from such extremely large coating stresses presently make the largest contribution to the telescope imaging error budget, of order 10 arcsec or more.  Consequently, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to meet the imaging requirements of IXO, or other high-resolution X-ray missions in the future that use thin-shell mirror technology, unless high-quality Ir coatings having significantly lower stresses can be developed.  The development of such coatings is precisely the aim of our proposal.  Specifically, building on our successful xxxxxx I effort, we propose to complete the development of low-stress Ir/Cr bilayers, and also investigate the use of Ir/Ti bilayers. We also propose to investigate the properties single-layer Ir films, as well as Ir/Cr and Ir/Ti bilayers, prepared by reactive sputtering with nitrogen.  Finally, we plan to transfer the low-stress Ir coating technology to our large, production-class sputtering system so that we can coat GSFC-supplied thin-shell mirror substrates and conclusively demonstrate reduced stress-driven substrate distortions.	16364
Regolith Derived Heat Shield for a Planetary Body Entry and Descent System with In-Situ Fabrication	2012-09-01	2018-07-19	High-mass planetary surface access is one of xxxxxx xxxxxx involving entry, descent and landing (EDL). During the entry and descent phase, frictional interaction with the planetary atmosphere causes a heat build-up to occur on the spacecraft which will rapidly destroy it if a heat shield is not used. xxxxxxver, the heat shield incurs a mass penalty because it must be launched from Earth with the spacecraft, thus consuming a lot of precious propellant. This project proposes to fabricate entry heat shields from the regolith of moons and asteroids. This in situ heat shield fabrication can save tons of mass (and millions of dollars in cost) that has to be transported from Earth.	16365
Novel Materials that Enhance Efficiency and Radiation Resistance of Solar Cells, Phase II	2011-03-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxs rely on arrays of solar cells to generate electrical power. It is an on-going challenge to maximize electrical power available to spacecraft while reducing overall stowage volume and mass of solar array, which requires developing more efficient solar cells with higher specific power density. The objective of this xxxxxx project is to develop a generic approach, based on novel functional nano-materials, to significantly increasing the solar cell efficiency (~10%), specific power density, radiation resistance and lifetime, without adding much cost or weight to the existing solar cells. The feasibility to synthesis such nano-materials has been explored and demonstrated in xxxxxx Without optimizing, preliminary test on commercial solar cells show an efficiency gain approaching 5% after applying such nano-materials. Such nano-materials will be further improved for energy efficiency and environmental durability in xxxxxx, to reach the objective of at least 10% gain in energy efficiency on majority of commercial solar cells.	16366

This will provide an initial understanding of the first generation of materials which can then be used for proof-of-concept additive manufacturing as well as to guide the development of further materials.	16367
Space-Ready Advanced Imaging System, Phase II	2009-12-01	2018-07-19	In this xxxxxx effort xxxxxx will increase the state-of-the-art for video/image systems.  This will include digital image compression algorithms as well as system level integration, encompassing the image sensor all the way to compressed imagery data transport.  To accomplish these goals xxxxxx will design a complete FPGA-based video compression system. The novel aspect of this design lies in the dynamically reconfigurable hardware IP cores that will interface to an embedded processor. Similar to a software defined radio (SDR) system where separate RF waveforms are loaded at runtime, xxxxxx aims to reload separate image compression encoders.  This enables the use of several different image/video compression standards, all on the same hardware platform.  The dynamically reconfiguring architecture of this system enables a single image sensor and hardware platform to handle the two most common space video camera applications, while still maintaining low power consumption in a highly integrated package.  First, H.264 for high framerate, real-time video for situational awareness and surveillance.  xxxxxxond, lossless JPEG200 encoding for scientific and research post-processing.  xxxxxxver, due to limited funds for this xxxxxx design, we will most likely work with a purchased H.264 IP core along with a standard JPEG compression core, which xxxxxx developed on the xxxxxx I of this program.  Providing the capability to reconfigure for both motion video and still image compression will provide near-term utility and demonstrate feasibility for xxxxxx development.  xxxxxx will target the solution to a custom fully radiation hardened hardware platform.  Potential radiation hardened components include a xxxxxx FPGA, xxxxxx PROM, xxxxxx SRAM memory, Aeroflex voltage regulators, and a xxxxxx CMOS image sensor paired with space-ready optics.	16368
A Queuing Model-Based System for Triggering Traffic Flow Management Algorithms, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Next generation air traffic management systems are expected use multiple software tools and quantitative methods for managing traffic flow in xxxxxx. xxxxxx and other aerospace research centers are involved in developing advanced numerical algorithms for strategic traffic flow management. These algorithms can be invoked at fixed time intervals, or can be employed whenever adverse traffic flow conditions occur. In order to avoid spurious responses, the control algorithms should be used only when actual traffic flow problems are likely to arise, and not in response to normal flow variations. Queuing models describe the aggregate stochastic behavior of the national airspace, and can provide not only mean flow characteristics, but also the expected variations. This proposal advances the development of a queuing model-based methodology for triggering traffic flow management algorithms. The approach , based on the measured state of the national airspace system. The approach exploits recently-developed queuing models of the NAS, together with recent advances in estimation theory. xxxxxx I research will demonstrate the feasibility of developing the traffic flow management triggering system using a simulation model of the national airspace system. xxxxxx research will integrate this methodology with xxxxxx traffic flow management algorithms, and assess the overall system performance n the ACES environment. xxxxxx and software developed under the xxxxxx project will be delivered to xxxxxx at the end of xxxxxx work.	16369

Damage Adaptive Guidance for Piloted Upset Recovery, Phase II	2017-05-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx (LOC) has been a longstanding contributor to fatal aviation accidents.  Inappropriate pilot action for healthy aircraft, control failures, and vehicle impairment are frequent contributors to LOC accidents. These accidents could be reduced if an on-board system was available to immediately guide the pilot to a safe flight condition (including cases of control failure or vehicle impairment). Barron Associates previously developed and demonstrated (in pilot-in-the-loop simulations) a system for finding appropriate control input sequences for upset recovery, and for cueing pilots to follow these sequences.The proposed work adds several innovative capabilities to the existing architecture and includes flight test verification of the efficacy.  One of the most significant current enhancements is the addition of adaptation to address off-nominal vehicle responses.  Off-nominal vehicle responses can occur for a number of reasons including adverse onboard conditions (e.g., actuator failures, engine failures, or airframe damage) and external hazards, especially icing.  The addition of adaptation capabilities enables the system to provide appropriate upset recovery guidance in cases of off-nominal vehicle response. The recovery guidance system is also specifically designed to be robust to variations in pilot dynamic behavior as well as to provide robustness to pilot deviations from the recommended recovery strategies.	16371

Passive water removal is incorporated into each cell of the power plant stack. Only pressure differential is required to manage within the cell and to remove and discharge liquid product water from the power plant. The APWR system eliminates the gas circulator, centrifugal separator, heat exchanger (condenser) and controls that comprise the water management system in the conventional aqueous electrolyte fuel cell power plants now in service It also can simplify the reactant supply system by elimination of fuel and oxidant humidifiers. No rotating or active components or gas circulation are required in the APWR system. APWR is based on PEM technology proven in industrial and automotive applications but not applied to space power plants.	16373

DEP xxxxxx of the future have demands for Energy xxxxxx xxxxxxs with large counts of cells put in series and parallel to achieve needed voltage and energy levels.  The X57 xxxxxx xxxxxxtery comprises of over 6000 cells. As the pack goes through repeated charge/discharge cycles, as well as environmental cycles, each individual cell begins to lose its capacity.  Cell to cell capacity variation causes the entire pack to limited by the weakest cell. Traditional Passive Balancing topologies are limited in their ability to address cell mismatch on the discharge cycle.  xxxxxx balancing allows a dynamic measurement & control system to discharge cells at variable rates. With a more robust measurement & control architecture, xxxxxx topologies have the ability to integrate more advanced algorithms. These algorithms include predictive health monitoring, life based management, physics based cell modelling.  xxxxxx can last longer, avoid thermal runaway, and avoid maintenance.  xxxxxx is proposing development of an active BMS concept, with associated algorithms to achieve a 40% life improvement on the X57 pack.	16375

Low Permeation Envelope Material Development for Titan Aerobot, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	Aerobot vehicles for missions on xxxxxx require envelope materials that are strong, light and durable. Unlike terrestrial balloon materials, these must be able to withstand flexing at temperatures of 90K without developing pinhole leaks. To meet this requirement, it is proposed to use xxxxxx experience in lightweight laminated sailcloth and ultra light film lamination to create a material for this application. This will be a laminated combination of multiple thin films and fabric. Test capabilities will be created and correlated to those already done at xxxxxx-JPL. xxxxxxrature search and sample testing will determine the appropriate film, adhesive, fibers, and fabric weave. Further testing will determine the minimum manageable film thickness and the minimum amount of adhesive needed to meet the mission requirements. Laminations of multiple layers of thin film will be tested to determine the benefit of this schedule compared to single layer equivalent films. Small quantities of the most promising film and fabric laminate designs will be produced on a narrow width laminator that duplicates the process used to produce full sized products and tested for flex durability.	16378

Comparison of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Methods	2010-09-22	2018-07-19	Several different unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms have been applied to xxxxxx (xxxxxx) data to serve the purpose of developing a comprehensive suite of xxxxxxted xxxxxxs Health Management (ISHM) tools. As the theoretical bases for these methods vary considerably, it is reasonable to conjecture that the resulting anomalies detected by them may differ quite significantly as well. As such, it would be useful to apply a common metric with which to compare the results. xxxxxxver, for such a quantitative analysis to be statistically significant, a sufficient number of examples of both nominally categorized and anomalous data must be available. Due to the lack of sufficient examples of anomalous data, use of any statistics that rely upon a statistically significant sample of anomalous data is infeasible. Therefore, the main focus of this paper will be to compare actual examples of anomalies detected by the algorithms via the sensors in which they appear, as well the times at which they appear. We find that there is enough overlap in detection of the anomalies among all of the different algorithms tested in order for them to corroborate the severity of these anomalies. In certain cases, the severity of these anomalies is supported by their categorization as failures by experts, with realistic physical explanations. For those anomalies that can not be corroborated by at least one other method, this overlap says less about the severity of the anomaly, and more about their technical nuances, which will also be discussed.	16380

Having a fast-transient design is critical when operating a digital ASIC or FPGA that typically require a large amount of decoupling capacitance (lots of area on the board) to be able to respond to dynamic load change within their core. The main characteristics of this design are: 1 to 5 V input voltage, 0.8 - 4.5 V regulated output voltage, fully integrated, load current scalable power train, high efficiency (peak efficiency at 94%) digital hysteretic converter. The main deliverable of this research will be a single chip, all digitally hysteretic controlled solution, where a fully integrated all digital xxxxxx point-of-load regulator with programmable hysteresis window will deliver a load current of 0.1A to 2A. Due to its fully integrated solution, the controller design will be 2.5x2.5 mm2 on a 0.13um 18um CMOS process.

TEPC Microdosimeter for LEO and Beyond, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	A new generation of Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counters (TEPCs) for micro-dosimetric measurements will be designed, incorporating recent advances in the electronics industry and a new detector configuration. The unit is projected to be 2.5x4.5x1 in, weigh less than 8 oz, and consume less than 100 mW of power.   A detector configuration of thirteen half-inch spheres arranged in a 2-D array will be used - twelve connected together to form an equivalent spherical 1.74-inch diameter detector for measuring low fluence environments, and the thirteenth detector connected independently allowing measurements during high fluence periods when the larger detector would saturate (such as during solar particle events). The new electronics  will continuously convert the detector data at 1 Mhz. Digital methods will allow both the setting of any threshold and the determination of event peaks, and allow more sophisticated signal processing to be used to reduce noise and eliminate micro-phonics. In addition, a bi-processing method of analyzing the detector signals will allow determination of dose by both integration method and peak method which can then be analyzed to provide accurate total dose readings for the events from the threshold to below 0.05 keV/micron. The spectra below several kev/micron is important as it can contain up to 40% of the total dose.The detector filled with pure propane will simulate a 2 micron site size. Two spectra will be stored each minute, and total integrated dose, dose above threshold, dose equivalent dead-time will be provided every second. The spectra will have 2048 channels at 1 keV/micron for each channel, to a maximum of 2047 keV/micron. The threshold for peak detection and analysis can be set anywhere from 0.4 to 20 keV/micron. The unit will be capable of measurement ranging from less than 100 nGy/hr to over 100 mGy/hr.	16386

The main goal for this program is development of techniques that enable fault tolerant control based on diagnostic features from the coil winding and power transistors. During xxxxxx I, Impact achieved substantial and promising results in three main technical areas that provide opportunities to maturing tools that enable PHM and reconfiguration techniques. The technical areas include: xxxxxx Performance, Motor/xxxxxx Performance, and xxxxxx. During xxxxxx, a significant effort will be employed to further develop the automated ringing feature extraction feature, leakage current sensing capabilities, and reconfiguration techniques for continued motor operation. These efforts will lead to development of prototype sensors for IGBT aging detection and current leakage detection as a health indicator of aging effects in power drives.  Moreover, Impact will demonstrate reconfigurable control techniques for fault accommodations in EM applications. The long term implications of a successful completion of this program will provide reliability and health management tools for mission and safety critical applications for xxxxxx, commercial, and military enterprises.	16388

Spatially Coherent Optical Velocimeter Array for Rapid Guided-wave NDE, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The pace and progress of new sensor technology development continues to lag far behind the broad ranging potential offered by guided wave NDE. In response to xxxxxx solicitation H13.01 for xxxxxxanced NDE xxxxxx for Complex Built-up xxxxxx, xxxxxxanced xxxxxxs and Technologies xxxxxx., propose a collaborative program which seeks to combine an advanced sensor technology for rapid wide-area capture of ultrasound wave-field data with recent advances in NDE guided wave signal processing. This proposal describes how xxxxxx (SCOVA), combined with chirped ultrasound excitation and narrow tone-band decomposition provide deep data sets for application of new spatio-temporal and spatio-spectral analyses to address a broad range of NDE functions pertinent to xxxxxx spaceflight structures. In form and function, SCOVA offers a sensor geared towards practical deployment of guided wave NDE. The ability of SCOVA to capture swept ultrasound data at hundreds of points simultaneously, offers a major advancement in the practical application of guided wave NDE targeting multiple defect modalities in current and future complex spaceflight structures.	16390
Certification of the COTS Engine and Naturalistic Flight Deck Systems for the Next Generation of Small Aircraft, Phase II	2008-05-01	2018-07-19	We intend to perform a 'Demonstration' xxxxxx of a COTS automotive engine, including and focusing on what is likely to be one of the most challenging aspects of the FAA Engine xxxxxx, the FAA approval of a COTS automotive Engine Control xxxxxx (ECU). The COTS automotive based ECU is the most technically challenging system due, not only to the design and manufacturing processes employed in the mass production of the ECU, but because of the 'criticality' of the ECU in the functions it performs on the COTS engine, and the 'criticality' of the ECU when it is integrated within the aircraft system, for the safety of flight.In addition the COTS automotive ECU contains complex electronic hardware and software, and employs mass production processes, with advanced manufacturing technologies and packaging techniques, which are not currently employed in the production of commercial aviation flight critical digital electronic systems today.We are confident that the approach taken for the 'Demonstration' xxxxxx of the COTS engine, and the COTS ECU, can then be 'leveraged' into achieving FAA approval of not only all other aspects of the propulsion system, but also into the aircraft flight control systems, including the flight deck electronics, displays, communication and navigation systems.	16391
High Power Narrow Linewidth 1.26 Micron Ho-Doped Fiber Amplifier, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	This proposal is for the development of an innovative, high power, and extremely reliable 1.26-micron Ho-doped fluoride fiber amplifier. The proposed fiber amplifier consists of a Ho-doped fluoride fiber pre-amplifier and power amplifier.  xxxxxx at 1187 nm will be used as a resonant pump laser source for Ho3+-doped fiber laser.  High gain per unit length at 1.26 micron can be achieved in Ho-doped fluoride glass fiber due to the strong pump absorption at 1187 nm and strong emission at 1.2 micron transition.  The proposed Ho-doped fiber amplifier will be implemented into a MOPA system with a 1.26 micron single frequency Ho-doped fiber laser.  This type of fiber based seed laser is needed for remote sensing of O  and O -N  for measuring atmospheric pressure.  Concurrent on-board O2 measurements using lines at 1.26 ìm to allow for the best relative compensation for aerosol scattering along the line-of-sight of the xxxxxx and O2 measurements. The particular O2 band was chosen so that the surface and atmospheric scattering characteristics from aerosols and thin clouds would be nearly the same as for the measurement of xxxxxx at 1.57 ìm.  It's part of program to provide space-based active measurements of xxxxxx for xxxxxx Sensing of xxxxxx Emissions over xxxxxxs, xxxxxxs, and xxxxxx (ASCENDS) Mission.	16392
Hybrid Guidance System for Relative Navigation, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	Future xxxxxx architectures and missions will involve many distributed platforms that must work together. This in turn requires guidance, navigation and control (xxxxxx) technology such as systems that determine spacecraft relative range and attitude. The proposed Hybrid xxxxxx xxxxxx (HGS) will be such a system, providing increased relative navigation accuracy and robustness while reducing mass, volume, and power consumption by a factor of 2 to 4. The HGS's key innovation is integration of three proven and developed sensor technologies (laser-based retro-image pattern matching, laser range-finding, and correlation) into a low-power package. We will develop non-linear navigation estimation algorithms to fuse the sensor outputs together as well as to integrate the system output with other on-board navigation systems. The state estimate generation using three different techniques will increase the system's robustness through the ability to reject faulty measurements from one component of the system. xxxxxx I of the xxxxxx will verify feasibility of the HGS design and the navigation algorithms and will culminate in a realistic mission simulation of vehicles using the HGS as part of an integrated xxxxxx system. The results of this simulation will serve as an excellent springboard to xxxxxx HGS prototype hardware and embedded software development.	16393
Materials for Damping Ambient Acoustic and Vibration Signals, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	Long-term exposure to even relatively low levels of acoustic and vibration signals has been shown to be potentially harmful to humans. A new class of piezoelectric materials is proposed to provide acoustic and vibration damping for increased crew comfort and protection for long-duration space flight. The effectiveness for piezoelectric materials to damp the kinetic energy of mechanical stimuli such as vibration, impact or acoustic signals has been previously demonstrated by the applicant and others. The proposed piezoelectric materials can be incorporated into crew clothing, seating and bedding; linings for floor, wall and/or ceilings; and integrated into composite panels for use as structural members in vehicle construction. Due to the novel nature of the materials, xxxxxx I will focus primarily on production and characterization of mechanical and piezoelectric properties for sample materials. While issues such as off-gassing and flammability are not considered problematic for the proposed materials, these will also be evaluated during xxxxxx	16394

Flexible Production of Geometrically Complex Superalloy Components, Phase II	2014-06-01	2018-07-19	In order to design and manufacture complex, one-of-a-kind to limited quantity rocket propulsion system components, while shortening the development cycle time and reducing the associated costs, an innovative method must be developed that expands upon current manufacturing technologies. A flexible manufacturing system that can handle the production of such parts in short time periods is desirable.

Considering the need for design flexibility as well as shorter development cycles, reduced costs, and minimized variance in making one-of-a-kind components, an innovative manufacturing technology will be demonstrated in this work to fabricate geometrically complex superalloy components	16396
Advanced Radiative Emitters for Radioisotope Thermophotovoltaic Power Systems, Phase I	2010-01-01	2018-07-19	Radioisotope xxxxxx xxxxxxs (xxxxxx) are critical for future flagship exploration missions in space and on planetary surfaces.  Small improvements in the xxxxxx performance, weight, size, and/or reliability can have a dramatic effect on the scientific capability of the vehicle and the overall mission costs.  Radioisotope Thermophotovoltaic (RTPV) energy converters are a particular type of xxxxxx that directly convert the heat produced by a xxxxxxral xxxxxx (GPHS) to electrical power using a specialized xxxxxx (PV) cell.  A key element in an RTPV system is the radiative emitter that converts GPHS thermal energy to radiative energy that illuminates the PV cell.  In this project, Creare and the xxxxxx Institute of xxxxxx (MIT) propose to develop an advanced, 2-D, photonic crystal radiative emitter that is optimized for RTPV systems.  The emitter will provide high emittance in the bandgap of the PV cell with low emittance elsewhere that, when coupled with advanced PV cell filter technology, will provide high system efficiency.  In xxxxxx I, we will design the emitter and fabricate test samples, which will be fully characterized for high-temperature emittance and durability.  We will also assess the impact of this new emitter on the overall RTPV system design and performance.	16397

Novel Real-Time Flight Envelope Monitoring System, Phase II	2012-12-01	2018-07-19	The proposed innovation is an aircraft flight envelope monitoring system that will provide real-time in-cockpit estimations of aircraft flight envelope boundaries.  The adaptable system will provide information on current and predicted aircraft performance and controllability, alerting the pilot to any aerodynamic degradation of the aircraft control surfaces.  This includes heavy rain, in-flight icing encounters, environmental contamination of surfaces, and structural damage such as bird strikes or battle damage.  The real-time monitoring system measures the unsteady control surface hinge moment from all aircraft aerodynamic controls.  Control surface hinge moments are sensitive to the aerodynamics of the section, including separation.  These data are processed and information on the current and predicted future state of aircraft performance and control (including asymmetric cases) is made available to the pilot or flight management system.  xxxxxx I results have shown that the hinge moment sensor concept is a viable technology for the monitoring and prediction of airfoil stall.  The hinge moment monitoring system was able to provide reliable stall warning and prediction across an incredibly wide range of simulated aerodynamic hazards.  The proposed aircraft flight envelope monitoring system is an integral part of an overall integrated vehicle health management system.	16400
MESSAGE 2 space experiment with Rhodospirillum rubrum S1H	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	R. rubrum xxxxxx inoculated on solid agar rich media was sent to the xxxxxx in October 2003 (MESxxxxxx-part 2 experiment). After 10 days flight R. rubrum cultures returned back to Earth. These cultures were then subjected to both transcriptomic and proteomic analysis and compared with the corresponding ground control. Whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray and high throughput proteomics which offer the possibility to survey respectively the global transcriptional and translational response of an organism were used to test the effect of space flight. Moreover in an effort to identify a specific stress response of R. rubrum to space flight ground simulation of space ionizing radiation and space gravity were performed under identical culture setup and growth conditions encountered during the actual space journey. This study is unique in combining the results from an actual space experiment with the corresponding space ionizing radiation and modeled microgravity ground simulations which lead to a more solid dissection of the different factors contribution acting in space flight conditions. Total xxxxxx was extracted from R. rubrum xxxxxx grown after 10 days in space flight or after 10 days in simulated ionizing radiation or simulated microgravity. Each microarray slide contained 3 technical repeats.	16401

Low Cost/Low Noise Variable Pitch Ducted Fan, Phase I	2006-01-01	2018-07-19	ACI proposes a design for a Propulsor (Low Cost/Low Noise Variable PitchDucted xxxxxx) that has wide application in all sectors of Aviation.Propulsor hardware of this low cost design can be integrated with abroad range of aircraft engines (e.g. existing piston engines,automotive derivative piston engines, new design turbine engines) foruse in new design aircraft.   The proposed Propulsor design willincorporate known acoustic design features that support low noiseaircraft operation.  These features include the use of duct acousticliners, attenuating harmonic stator vane and rotor blade configurations,and duct designs that direct/condition the exhaust air stream tominimize noise heard by individuals on the ground during aircrafttakeoff, landing, and fly-over.   The proposed Propulsor design makespossible the fabrication of low cost and low weight variable pitch fanblades and rotors.  The new composite blade/retention design avoids theneed for heavy and expensive ball bearings and other complex hub pitchchange mechanism components.	16403
Augmented Reality Telepresence for Robotic Exploration	2019-08-01	2018-07-19	State of the art virtual reality requires low latency, on the order of single-digit milliseconds to present a scene to an operator using immersive tracking devices. In conventional teleoperation, the operator's movements are used to directly control a remote camera, requiring a fast response time to avoid simulator sickness, an approach not feasible for interplanetary robotic control with limited bandwidth, high latency communications. The proposed work develops a hybrid architecture to present a model of a coarse virtual world to an operator, while the real imagery slowly refines the presentation as bandwidth allows. An online physics engine allows an actuation command in the virtual world to be faithfully executed in the real world without direct operator feedback. The end goal is a smooth, visually realistic operator interface that allows for remote operation of an exploration vehicle in a blended world scene of virtual and actual data.	16404
A portable source of lattice-trapped and ultracold strontium (PLUS), Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	We propose to design and demonstrate a portable source of lattice-trapped, ultracold strontium (PLUS). The device uses simplified and robust techniques for loading the traps, and directly leverages hardware already developed by AOxxxxxx. The simplified architecture for PLUS makes it amenable to future space qualification. When paired with a sufficiently stable local oscillator, PLUS can be operated as an optical lattice clock. xxxxxxernatively, the lattice-trapped atoms could serve as a starting point for producing quantum degenerate Sr gases for use in future sensor technologies or fundamental science studies. In the latter case, possibilities span explorations of artificial gauge fields to quantum information processing. In xxxxxx I, AOxxxxxx will optimize the expected device performance through extensive modeling, trade-space analysis, and technology validation of the highest risk hardware. The design will cover the physics package and control system at the level of CAD models, ready for procurement that will begin during xxxxxx. We will also model device applications and generate a parts list and cost estimate for the construction of a prototype during xxxxxx.	16405

Flexible and Safe Control of Mobile Surface Systems, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	The primary innovation of this work is a novel Petri net based approach for safe and flexible control of highly capable mobile surface systems, such as long-duration science rovers, crew surface systems, multi-robot and human-robot teams.  The traditional approach of time-based sequence of commands will not be adequate for commanding and coordinating those surface systems because it does not support concurrent tasks and team coordination.  Those surface systems will best be supported by a state-based control architecture that explicitly models the states and their interactions.  Petri net is a mature and flexible formalism for representing such a state-based control architecture.  This research will develop novel Petri net based techniques to enable 1) explicit modeling and control of concurrent tasks, team coordination, and mode switching, and 2) dynamic reconfiguration of a Petri net during its execution to support onboard planning and human/robot interactions.  The result of the proposed effort will be a Petri net based executive that can be integrated into a robot planning and control system for flexible and safe control of mobile surface systems.  In addition, a graphical tool will also be developed to enable operators to visualize, edit, and analyze the Petri nets.	16407
Compact UV Laser, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	In response to the development of components to advance the maturity of science instruments focused on the detection of evidence of life in the xxxxxx, xxxxxx proposes to develop a compact, robust, efficient, and radiation hardened UV laser capable of detecting organic molecules by means of the laser desorption technique. When slightly modified, the laser can be used to advance the development of instruments suitable for deployment on in-situ planetary and lunar missions such as xxxxxx and xxxxxx to analyze mineral composition of rock samples by performing imaging/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-Induced-Breakdown spectroscopies. The advantage in using these techniques for planetary science is the ability to rapidly collect a wealth of chemical information, by directing a laser beam on target of interest.In xxxxxx I, xxxxxx proposes the development of an ultra-compact, passively Q-switched laser, < 10 cm3 in volume that will produce 0.1-0.3 mJ energy, < 2 ns, 266-nm pulses at 5 kHz repetition rates. This laser will be designed to survive shock, vibration, thermal cycling, and radiation.In order to make a very compact laser, xxxxxx will use diode pumped solid state laser technology to produce 1-2 mJ of energy at 1064 nm using a Cr4+:YAG saturable absorber as the passive Q-switch to eliminate the need for a high voltage supply which is required for actively Q-switched lasers. The output of the laser will be frequency converted in two stages to produce 266 nm via nonlinear crystals specifically selected to survive a high radiation environment.  Compact electronics will also be designed from radiation hardened components.   In xxxxxx program, specially designed optical components will be procured to make the laser very compact and alignment insensitive; for example, bonded nonlinear crystals to minimize wavelength walk-off and maximize nonlinear conversion efficiency. The laser will be subjected to representative environmental condition to bring the xxxxxx to 6.	16408
DAWN GRAND MAP VESTA NEUTRON                                                 ABSORPTION V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	A global map of a unitless               compositional parameter, delta-C_perpendicular (DCP), and propagated    1-sigma uncertainties is provided.  DCP varies linearly with the        macroscopic thermal neutron absorption cross section of xxxxxx's         regolith.  An equation for converting tabulated DCP values to           absorption units is provided in this document. DCP was determined from  thermal and epithermal neutron counting rates measured by the xxxxxx      xxxxxx mission's xxxxxx and xxxxxx (GRaND) while in low      altitude mapping orbit, about 210 km from xxxxxx's surface.  The         measurements are representative of xxxxxx's bulk regolith composition    to depths of a few decimeters with a spatial resolution of about        300-km full-width-at-half-maximum of arc length on the surface.  The    methods used to determine neutron absorption are described by           PRETTYMANETAL2013.	16409

Automated Task Monitoring, Feedback and Training for Critical Missions	2015-10-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxs and astronauts on xxxxxx missions must frequently follow lengthy and complex sets of directions to perform the tasks required of them. Missing or not properly executing even a single step of the directions for these tasks is often costly and can be life threatening. Consider the following scenarios.xxxxxx 1: An astronaut forgets a step of a safety-critical procedure, such as when donning a spacesuit for an extravehicular activity. Because of the lack of a reminder, this error goes unnoticed. The astronaut is forced to re-enter the station early and is consequently unable to perform the days experiments.xxxxxx 2: When on space missions, astronauts frequently must perform maintenance, monitoring, or repair tasks which occur outside of their space vehicle. These tasks are often extremely complex; consequently, the astronauts usually must be guided in their work by a ground control personnel. Several issues arise from communication delays and the requirement of being in constant communication with ground control.xxxxxx 3: The amount of training each astronaut undergoes to prepare for a mission is extensive. The massive amount of information that astronauts must absorb coupled with the long duration of their training means that they simply cannot recall everything they have learned. xxxxxxs may need to schedule time to contact trainers on Earth, as there may not be a system for training and task review for all tasks while on a mission.The issues described previously can be alleviated with a system comprised of two components. The basis of the system is a method for tracking the current status of a task of an astronaut. Operating concurrently with this task-tracking system is a context-specific feedback component. In scenario 1, this feedback component would alert the astronaut to differences between the current task state and the expected task state to prevent dangerous safety errors while donning the suit. In scenario 2, this feedback component would similarly perform error detection during the maintenance task, but it would also be able to provide instructions for the next steps in the task in a manner that minimizes the error rate. Lastly, in scenario 3, this component would guide the astronaut through the task while providing error checking, but it would group and phrase its instructions in a manner which maximizes recall.The outcome of this research will be a set of principles to computationally represent tasks, heuristics for how to monitor task progress and visually detect errors, and specific feedback and instructional strategies designed to either minimize errors or maximize recall. These principles, heuristics, and strategies will be evaluated in lab studies in the context of xxxxxx missions. This research will draw from a variety of fields including machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, cognitive psychology, and human-computer interaction, and it will directly contribute to reducing resource use and improving safety on xxxxxx missions.The proposed research has potential benefits for two xxxxxx groups: the human-systems integration division (crew training) and the intelligent systems division (planning and scheduling). The project addresses the problem of heavy reliance on visual displays and described in STR 4.4.1 (xxxxxx-Modal Human-xxxxxxs Interaction) by using speech as a primary input and output modality. It also addresses issues described in STR 11.2.3 (Human-xxxxxx Performance xxxxxx) by alleviating the need for ground control contact during maintenance tasks and by offering innovative modes of human-automation interaction.	16411
Performance Enhancement of Deicing Systems with the Use of an Anti-ice Nano-coating, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	The proposed program addresses xxxxxx need for a new generation of icing mitigation technology for manned and unmanned vehicles, particularly related to icing on airframe of flight into supercooled liquid water clouds and regions of high ice crystal density. The state of the art active deicing method on leading edges involves either an electrical, pneumatic or vibration induced debonding of accumulated ice. With the advent of icephobic nanocoatings, there have been attempts to develop a durable passive xxxxxxice coating. xxxxxxver, success to date has been limited. The state of the art can be advanced if xxxxxxice coatings can be made more durable, and are made to function synergistically with active de-icing techniques. The advantages are reduced power consumption, improved service life of mechanical components, lighter electronics and extra protection in case of failure of active device. xxxxxx in collaboration with a manufacturer of low power ice protection systems for commercial and military aircraft, we propose in xxxxxx I to demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating a durable xxxxxxice coating with an active deicing device. The proposed program builds upon NEI's core competency of introducing desirable functionalities into engineered coatings. The xxxxxxice/deicing performance will be tested at our collaborator's icing wind tunnel. The objective of the xxxxxx program will be to further refine the coating composition and coating deposition process, as well as the configuration of the baseline active deicing device so as to deliver a working prototype of an integrated ice protection system that combines a passive xxxxxxice coating and an active deicing device.	16412
Wideband Radio Frequency Interference Detection for Microwave Radiometer Subsystem	2018-01-01	2018-07-19	"Anthropogenic Radio-Frequency Interference (RFI) is threatening the quality and utility of multi-frequency passive microwave radiometry. The xxxxxx xxxxxx (GMI) on the xxxxxx Precipitation Measurement (xxxxxx) mission launched on February 27, 2014 is already seeing RFI in the 10.7 and 18.7 GHz channels. It is important to understand that these frequency bands are strictly protected for science data measurement; yet, it is still corrupted by RFI. Indeed, this issue has led to the development of the first spaceborne digital RFI mitigation radiometer operating at 1.4 GHz for the xxxxxx Moisture xxxxxx and Passive (SMAP) mission. We leverage our experience on SMAP to develop innovative technology for wider-bandwidth higher-frequency radiometers.The objective of this proposal is to develop a wideband (200-1000 MHz) digital detector subsystem and to demonstrate innovative RFI detection and removal techniques for microwave radiometers. The techniques proposed, complex valued kurtosis detector and independent component analysis (ICA), have the potential to improve the RFI detection rate in high frequency bandwidth. We are responding to a national imperative to develop RFI mitigation technology for future spaceflight radiometers. \"xxxxxx Management for the Twenty-first Century\" recommends the continued development of so-called non-cooperative mitigation technologies. The xxxxxx xxxxxx roadmap for xxxxxx Components and xxxxxxs seeks “Demonstration of RFI mitigation approaches, and algorithms for future RFI environments to 40 GHz and beyond.” These two xxxxxxional xxxxxxearch Council reports emphasize the importance of RFI mitigation technology for sustaining a reliable national passive microwave remote sensing capability."	16413
Lightweight Inflatable Structural Airlock (LISA), Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxovative light-weight airlock technologies are required to integrate with any deep space and surface platform hosting xxxxxx (EVA). The CFD xxxxxxearch Corporation (CFDRC) team proposes an inflatable airlock structure that employs unique fabric architecture capable of delivering the lowest mass and greatest versatility of any competing design. The proposed fabric inflatable airlock design features a completely integrated air beam inter-wall to passively generate the wall stiffness required for airlock depressurization&#151;without the mass and bulk of aluminum pressure hulls or complexity of multi-structure adaptations of competing inflatable habitat architectures. The design is a modification of Thin Red xxxxxx xxxxxx's (xxxxxxA) patented xxxxxx High Performance Pressure xxxxxx (UHPV), the only fabric pressure vessel design with fully determinate load paths which allows for true mass optimization. This unique architecture utilizes a matrix of braided fiber tendons to contain the structure's global pressure loads. The underlying woven fabric and gas barrier envelopes are thereby only exposed to minimal local shell loads where they bulge outwards between adjacent tendons. xxxxxx in pure tension in the absence of load coupling, the tendon array architecture has been shown to be statically determinate and auto-stabilizing under extreme deflection. The proposed fabric inflatable airlock stows compactly for transport to the habitat further reducing logistic costs.	16414
Bodies in Space - Online Education for Secondary School Students, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx application proposes to develop, evaluate, and implement an Internet-based educational outreach site focusing on the varied biological effects of microgravity.  We will develop a website, xxxx, to host the curriculum and courses on the Internet.

The curriculum will be further revised by microgravity researchers, educational design specialists, and teaching physicians.  Learning theories that encourage skills and knowledge transfer, such as cognitive flexibility theory, will provide the foundation of the curriculum. xxxxxxs will be learner-oriented and support the development of decision-making skills through interactive scenarios.  Conveying the excitement of space research, xxxx will focus on relaying information in a manner that will enhance the meaningfulness of the investigations.  The website shall provide enhanced remote access allowing secondary school students the ability to access, learn, and participate in science activities.

A 10 K Multistage Cryocooler with Very Low Vibration, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxanced space-borne instruments require cooling at temperatures of 10 K and below.  These coolers will be used for as upper-stage cryocoolers for sub-xxxxxx cryocoolers and instruments or the primary cooler for electro-optical instruments.  xxxxxx loads for these detectors will range from 0.25 W to 1.0 W at the primary load site, with additional loads at higher temperatures for other subsystems.  Due to jitter requirements, a cryocooler with very low vibration is required.  In addition, a multistage cooler, capable of providing refrigeration at more than one temperature simultaneously, can provide the greatest system efficiency and lowest mass.  xxxxxxmachine-based xxxxxx cryocoolers are ideal candidates for these applications because they are highly efficient, lightweight, vibration-free, multistage compatible, and have long maintenance-free lifetimes.  Creare has developed state-of-the-art components needed to create turbo-xxxxxx cryocoolers for these missions.  During the current program, we propose to develop and demonstrate a two-stage cryocooler that provides refrigeration at 10 K, with additional cooling at 60 to 70 K.  On the xxxxxx I project, we will optimize the performance of an existing cryocooler for a particular xxxxxx mission class and measure its performance.  During the xxxxxx project, we plan to build an advanced cold-stage turboalternator, integrate it with the cryocooler and measure its performance at cold load temperatures as low as 10 K.  We will use the test results to develop a design for a fully optimized, flight cryocooler.	16416
Compact 2 Micron Seed Laser, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	This proposal is for the development of new compact, high power andextremely reliable 2 micron seed laser using newly developed Tm3+ dopedgermanate glass fibers, which exhibit high quantum efficiency. This typeof fiber based seed laser is needed for constructing high energy pulsed2 micron Ho-doped crystal lasers for LIDAR applications. We propose touse highly Tm3+ doped germanate glass fibers with high gain per unitlength to form a short linear cavity to generate single frequency fiberlaser operation. Germanate glass exhibits lower phonon energy comparedto silica glass, increasing the quantum efficiency of 3F4 level of Tm3+ions. Importantly, Tm3+ can be highly doped into germanate glasses,which results in so called cross-relaxation, dramatically improving thegain per unit length and the quantum efficiency. The single frequencyfiber laser will be used to construct seed lasers by integrating withcontrolling electronics.	16417

Altitude Compensating Nozzles	2016-10-01	2018-07-19	An xxxxxx xxxxxx (ACN) enables the nozzle flow to adjust with the ambient pressure as it decreases with altitude so that the plume is never significantly over or under-expanded. The performance of ACNs can be near optimal over most of the flight. Hence, mission integrated performance with an ACN could be higher than with a Conventional Bell (CB) nozzle. The purpose is to advance the xxxxxx of ACNs through static ground tests, and ultimately by demonstrating this technology through flight test. The primary near-term objective is to advance xxxxxx (DB) nozzle technology, and ultimately the team has plans to advance the xxxxxx of other ACN conceptual designs (e.g. aerospike, clustered aerospike, etc.).	16419
WRANGLER: Capture and De-Spin of Asteroids and Space Debris	2015-03-01	2018-07-19	WRANGLER will accomplish these functions by combining two innovative technologies that have been developed by TUI: the GRASP deployable net capture device, and the SpinCASTER tether deployer/winch mechanism. Successful testing of both technologies in a microgravity environment has established these technology components at mid-xxxxxx maturity. The leverage offered by using a tether to extract angular momentum from a rotating space object enables a very small nanosatellite system to de-spin a very massive asteroid or large spacecraft. The WRANGLER system is suitable for an incremental development program that will validate the technology through an affordable test flight in which a nanosatellite launched on a rideshare opportunity would capture and de-spin the upper state used to launch it.	16420
JSC Simulations of ADR Technologies	2013-10-01	2018-07-19	Leveraging efforts begun in FY12, this project has developed a unique hardware-in-the-loop dynamic testing environment for use in a proposed xxxxxx Debris Removal Vehicle (ADRV) spacecraft development activity.  This test-bed provides xxxxxx with a dynamic testing environment that allows an increase of roughly two orders of magnitude in relative motion over existing dynamic test facilities for testing a broad range of new sensors and software pertaining to spacecraft rendezvous, proximity operations, and capture. Particular emphasis is placed upon characterization of uncooperative objects, such as orbital debris, although this equipment could be used for a variety of other rendezvous and capture simulations.  It provides an initial operating capability using fully autonomous JSC-developed air bearing hardware, with sensors and GNC, to support this testing, in cooperation with partners from xxxxxx A&M xxxxxxersity, the Air Force xxxxxxoratory (AFRL), and the xxxxxx Corporation.  Provides a hardware-in-the-loop demonstration at JSC of two-body proximity operations using air bearing sleds emulating the ADRV and debris target represented by a xxxxxx 1 upper stage nozzle on loan from the xxxxxxF.xxxxxx debris in xxxxxx (LEO) is an international problem that threatens the success of all future xxxxxx (LEO) space and exploration activities.  xxxxxxearch indicated that removing large debris objects is the best means to reduce the overall hazard from orbital debris, since large debris is the creation engine for smaller, more numerous, fractionation objects. xxxxxx on an analysis of alternatives of various remediation methods, this project has implemented a testing environment consistent with the chosen approach, a tug-based method to actively capture and deorbit the debris.  xxxxxxver, this type of mission must consider that large debris bodies are derelict and without active controls, hence unable to hold a consistent attitude.  Worse yet, they are often tumbling at rates of up to 3 revolutions per minute, a rate dramatically higher than prior rendezvous and proximity operations state-of-the-art.  Therefore, methods to test approach and capture methods, as well as sensor and guidance navigation and control concepts, were needed in order to retire the principle risks with this type of mission.  First in three degrees of freedom, and initially at lower rates, the developed testing environment will be used to mature the operational techniques as well as the sensor technologies necessary for this mission to be successful.  As maturity is accumulated, relative rates will be increased, and although out of the initial scope of the project, additional degrees of freedom, up to five and six DOF, will later be incorporated. 	16421

This comprehensive characterization categorizes and provides the necessary parameters regarding these celestial sources that make them beneficial for spacecraft navigation.  xxxxxx upon past research work, specific information about each unique X-ray source must be attained in order for the source to yield its optimum capabilities.  We will identify the appropriate parameters for characterizing aperiodic or transient sources for their use in navigation.   Additionally, the existing X-ray source catalogue will be updated and enhanced.  xxxxxx will focus on implementing these source models in detailed XNAV simulations and potentially creating flight software versions of these models.	16422

Model Predictive Control of an Underdamped, Pneumatically Actuated, Soft Robot with Flexible Links for Unmodeled Environments	2017-09-01	2018-07-19	Soft robots (made of compliant or soft materials) are often perceived as less capable when compared to traditional rigid robots. xxxxxxver, the proposed work will show that we can have compliant robots that are effective when operating in uncertain conditions while still having precise, high performance control for manipulation and mobility. In order to dramatically improve control for soft robots, we will initially develop optimal control methods on a 14 degree of freedom, pneumatically actuated, fabric-based, light-weight, mechanically robust robot torso and arms.  This system is underactuated and underdamped, and we expect that advances in control for this platform will translate directly to systems with similar dynamics. Furthermore, the resilience of this platform to unmodeled collisions will enable us, as part of our proposed research, to develop algorithms for collaboratively working with other soft robots or people in harsh environments such as space. The platform on which we are developing our algorithms is light-weight, relatively inexpensive, and can be compactly stored for transportation. The result of our proposed work will be a set of control algorithms that will improve the overall performance and relevance of soft robots for future xxxxxx missions.	16424

Designer Fluid for use in a Single Loop Variable Heat Rejection Thermal Control System, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	The efficient thermal control of vehicles is essential to the success of every single xxxxxx mission. All vehicles have very tight requirements for the thermal control systems while simultaneously placing incredibly stringent demands upon them. These demands are getting even more intense given the shift towards variable heat rejection, which is essential in missions reaching beyond the lower earth orbit. Specifically, the thermal control fluid must maintain excellent thermal properties for heat rejection under peak conditions while at the same time remain liquid at extremely low temperatures down to -90 xxxxxx. Currently used fluids either do not meet the low temperature requirement (glycol/water mixture) or do not have thermal properties conducive to a compact, efficient system (Galden). xxxxxxstream has identified several promising next generation thermal fluids using computation chemical techniques. In the xxxxxx I, xxxxxxstream will experimentally evaluate the thermal properties of promising single chemicals and chemical mixtures. These data will be used to determine the overall benefit to a thermal control system in terms of thermal performance and pumping power. In xxxxxx, xxxxxxstream will perform more long term durability, compatibility and performance studies in a simulated test-loop representative of conditions encountered on xxxxxx spacecraft.	16432
Compact Kinetic Mechanisms for Petroleum-Derived and Alternative Aviation Fuels, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	"To be useful for computational combustor design and analysis using tools like the xxxxxxional Combustion Code (NCC), low-dimensional chemical kinetic mechanisms for modeling of real fuel combustion chemistry must be sufficiently compact so that they can be utilized in multi-dimensional, multi-physics, reacting computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Despite advances in CFD-appropriate kinetic mechanism reduction for kerosene-range fuels, significant combustion property variation among current and prospective certified fuels remains a challenge for meaningful CFD-advised design of high pressure, low-emissions combustors. The proposed project will leverage xxxxxx's ongoing work in aviation fuel surrogate formulation and modeling as well as kinetic mechanism development for emissions and high pressure combustion to produce and demonstrate a meta-model framework for automated generation of fuel-flexible compact chemical kinetic mechanisms appropriate for 3-D combustion CFD codes. xxxxxx I will demonstrate the novel meta-model approach by providing compact kinetic mechanisms for both a \"typical\" xxxxxx/JP-8 (POSF-4658), as well as a synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) derived from natural gas (POSF 4734). xxxxxx of this proposed work would generalize the xxxxxx I results to span the combustion property parameter space relevant to both conventional and next-generation alternative aviation fuels.  The commercial product foreseen from this xxxxxx program is a stand-alone, novice-friendly real fuel kinetic mechanism generator software package that can interface with commercially-available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes.  Potential customers may include the companies supplying ANSYS, CFD-ACE+, or COMSOL, as well as industrial users with proprietary in-house codes.  xxxxxx to yield compact real fuel kinetic models has similar broad appeal for computational simulations in  automotive, aerospace (both defense and civilian), and marine propulsion industries."	16433

Passively-Coded Embedded Wideband Microwave Sensors for Material Characterization and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)	2019-08-01	2018-07-19	"Materials and structures are constantly subject to fatigue and degradation, and monitoring and maintaining civil, space, and aerospace infrastructure is an ongoing critical issue facing our society today. As new materials, such as complex multilayer composites, come into wider use, the need to monitor them is also rapidly growing. xxxxxx exploration adds to this need by offering extreme conditions and increased risk associated with material failure. The proposed research seeks to tackle this problem by developing passively-coded miniature embedded wideband microwave sensors, exploring their applicability, and investigating the utility of a novel and unique methodology for inspecting materials and complex structures. Each sensor will consist of a miniaturized wideband antenna specifically designed to have a number of resonances in its reflection property. By using the reflection properties of the antenna, regions in frequency of resonance and reflection can be associated with 0s and 1s to create a specific \"code\" for that antenna. This code shifts (in frequency) or alters based on the properties and degradation of the material in which the antenna is embedded. These sensors could be embedded in materials and structures such as concrete, a composite fuselage, or an astronaut's planetary habitat, and by being passive, the sensors will not need to be energized (i.e., wired in or provided with a power source). In the case of a planetary habitat, an astronaut could easily inspect their home for damage using a simple transceiver, and perform repairs or preventative maintenance if necessary. This practice would increase the astronaut's safety and minimize the risk of structure failure while they explore and are faced with the unforgiving environment of space. Because this technology is of such a low xxxxxx nature, its full application range cannot be conceptualized at this point. xxxxxxver, with their low cost nature and versatility, these sensors have the potential to be integrated into many space structures and materials as well as everyday civil and aerospace structures like bridges, parking garages, and planes. Additionally, the sensor data could be used to refine manufacturing processes. This research will be pursued as part of an electrical engineering MS degree at xxxxxx S&T under the guidance of Dr. xxxxxx and the tools needed to engage in this research will be primarily provided through the xxxxxxlied xxxxxx and Nondestructive xxxxxx xxxxxx (amntl) on campus."	16437

Wearable Health Monitoring Systems, Phase II	2010-02-01	2018-07-19	The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of producing a wearable health monitoring system for the human body that is functional, comfortable, bendable in 3 dimensions, durable, water-proof, washable, and light-weight. This new technology area of wearable health systems, sometimes referred to as smart-clothing, promises to allow for a secondary human nervous system that connects various different electronic devices positioned on or around the human body. As the shrinking in size and weight of electronic circuits has progressed, it is now possible for the modern human astronaut to carry increasing numbers of different electronic devices and sensors such as thermometers, gas monitors, microphones, altimeters, digital processors, digital memory, and push-button controls. These devices allow the astronaut to access data about their current environment and health status, and communicate with other astronauts and/or databases to send and receive information of value. As the variation in the number of devices and sensors that can be deployed increases greatly, a new technology is required to allow the seamless integration of these devices with the human astronaut so that the devices can be electrically powered, operated, re-charged, and communicate with each other over a digital pathway.	16441

Lunar Materials Handling System, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx Materials xxxxxx xxxxxx (Lxxxxxx) is a method for transfer of bulk materials and products into and out of process equipment in support of lunar and xxxxxx in situ resource utilization (ISRU). The Lxxxxxx conveys solids to the ISRU vessel, provides a gas-tight pressure/vacuum seal, and minimizes wear related to abrasive particles. xxxxxx and xxxxxx ISRU scenarios require that equipment be operated over many cycles with minimal consumption of expendables and with minimal leakage in order to maintain high overall process leverage. ISRU processes can be demonstrated in the laboratory to establish basic feasibility with respect to reagent leverage. Reagent leverage is defined as the mass of commodity produced divided by the mass of reagents consumed. xxxxxxver, the process leverage component related to equipment wear and loss of gasses, reagents, or product through seals and valves is more difficult to establish from laboratory testing. The Lxxxxxx increases equipment life and minimizes process losses, thereby increasing overall leverage and reducing uncertainties in ISRU process evaluation. The Lxxxxxx is based on a seal arrangement by which lunar regolith can be introduced into and removed from reaction chambers operating under a wide range of batch operating conditions.	16443

Integrated Composite Rocket Nozzle Extension, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	"ORBITEC proposes to develop and demonstrate an xxxxxxted Composite xxxxxx Nozzle Extension (ICRNE) for use in rocket thrust chambers. The ICRNE will utilize an innovative bonding approach to join a high-temperature composite nozzle extension to a regeneratively cooled metallic nozzle. The ICRNE technology will allow high-temperature composite materials to be directly integrated into a regeneratively-cooled nozzle section or thrust chamber made out of high-strength metallic alloys, thereby eliminating the heavy bolted flange joint that is currently used to attach high-temperature nozzle extensions. The resulting weight reduction will increase the thrust-to-weight ratio of the rocket engine. The ICRNE will also eliminate the need for multiple seals in the bolted flange joints, thus increasing reliability. The focus of the proposed xxxxxx effort will be to demonstrate the ICRNE technology by manufacturing and evaluating test specimens. A prototype ICRNE will also be designed and analyzed.

Protecting cardiomyocytes from mixed fields of radiation by BIO 300, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	The cumulative dose of radiation exposure to our astronauts remains one of the limiting roadblocks to longer duration missions in space.  Humanetics Corporation (Humanetics) is developing a novel radioprotectant, BIO 300, for use in both clinical radiotherapy and as a radiation countermeasure. BIO 300 is a safe, shelf-stable pharmaceutical which has been shown to mitigate both the acute and delayed effects of radiation exposure. BIO 300 is in advanced stages of clinical development, and is currently being evaluated as a radioprotectant of healthy lung tissue during radiotherapy treatment for non-small cell lung cancer in a xxxxxx I/II trial.  One component of developing radioprotectants for space is understanding if the therapy can protect against broad-spectrums of ionizing radiation, rather than just man-made xxxxxxs.  Thus, the objective of this proposal is to examine BIO 300's radioprotective capabilities against mission-relevant doses of neutron/gamma mixed-fields of radiation.  Another component of the work proposed here, is to utilize a novel cellular platform of terminally differentiated human cardiomyocytes to investigate degenerative consequences of radiation exposure in a functional human tissue model. Together, these studies will validate the utility of BIO 300 as a countermeasure for extraterrestrial radiation exposures.	16449
Scramjet Combustion Stability Behavior Modeling, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	A recent breakthrough in combustion stability analysis (UCDS) offers the means to accurately predict the combustion stability of a scramjet.  This capability is very important due to the extreme scramjet operational environment, which makes cut-and-try development approaches impractical.  With UCDS, it is now possible to accurately predict the scramjet pressure oscillation amplitudes, along with critical parameters, including the unsteady wall heat flux. The UCDS tools were recently applied to the xxxxxx I thrust oscillation issue in support of xxxxxx Thrust Oscillation Focus xxxxxx (TOFT).  This effort included the analysis of the xxxxxx four segment solid rocket motor (RSRM) to validate the capabilities of UCDS.  After analyzing the new five segment (RSRMV) motor being developed for xxxxxx I, GTL used the UCDS insight to identify a relatively minor motor modification that will eliminate the organized motor oscillations.With this validation of the capabilities and effectiveness of UCDS, GTL proposes to extend the application of UCDS by applying it to examine the stability characteristics of a representative scramjet.  In addition to predicting the amplitudes of the scramjet pressure oscillations, a UCDS sensitivity analysis will be used to identify critical design parameters and establish development guidelines.	16450

Blocking Filters with Enhanced Throughput for X-Ray Microcalorimetry, Phase II	2011-03-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx will fly x-ray microcalorimeters on several mission payloads scheduled within the next 5 years: xxxxxx and improved IR/xxxxxx blocking filters are urgently needed to realize the full potential and throughput of these missions. The innovation proposed, high transmission polyimide support mesh, will replace the nickel mesh used in previous blocking filter designs. Polyimide's composition affords high transparency to x-rays, especially above 3 keV. xxxxxx prototypes demonstrated 11-15% higher transmission than comparable nickel mesh across the UV-xxxxxx-NIR range. With development of the xxxxxx process in xxxxxx 2, the mesh will be optimized for strength, transmission, integration with filter materials, and filter lifetime; it will include deicing capability as required. Lithographic production means adaptability to meet future mission-specific filter performance requirements. The xxxxxx 2 project will achieve a flight readiness level of 5-6 for blocking filters using the new mesh. xxxxxx results show that with successful process development, the proposed high transmission polyimide mesh will significantly improve mission throughput and effective area for microcalorimeter payloads on proposed xxxxxx missions such as xxxxxx and xxxxxx in the near term as well as Constellation-X.	16454
High energy single frequency Yb:YAG crystalline fiber waveguide master oscillator power amplifier, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	The overall objective is to demonstrate the concept of xxxxxx crystalline fiber MOPA laser and investigation the technical feasibility toward 50 mJ single frequency MOPA system in the xxxxxx research. xxxxxx crystalline fiber waveguides are made from true rare-earth doped YAG crystals with Adhesive-Free Bond (AFB&#174;) technology. Compared with silica or phosphate glasses, the YAG crystalline fiber waveguides have the following advantages: (i) YAG crystal has at least one order of magnitude lower xxxxxx scattering (SBS) gain coefficient than silica or phosphate glasses (10-15 to 10-12 vs 10-11 m/W), which directly leads to the SBS free power being at least one order of magnitude higher than the glass fibers; (ii) YAG crystal has much higher thermal conductivity than glass fibers (10.7 vs 1.38 W/m degree C). Therefore, much shorter fiber length that is only about one tenth of the glass fiber can be used for the same pumping conditions and the SBS threshold can be further increased; (iii) Due to the shortening in the fiber length, straight fiber can be practically used for high power amplification. Therefore, large single mode area (LSMA) can be more easily achieved. Considering the high pulse energy requirement in a future xxxxxxT mission, only large mode area (LMA) xxxxxx fibers with core size >40 mm will be fabricated and investigated in the xxxxxx-I research. The fibers will be double clad to increase the pumping power and efficiency, while maintaining near diffraction limit laser beam quality.	16455
Flow Quality Analysis of Shape Morphing Structures for Hypersonic Ground Testing Applications	2017-08-01	2018-07-19	Background:Shape morphing, high temperature, ceramic structural materials are now becoming available and can revolutionize ground testing by providing dynamic flow capabilities to wind tunnels.  The use of ceramic materials permits the wind tunnels to be run at high temperatures.  Teledyne xxxxxxentific Company is currently developing shape-morphing ceramic hypersonic wind tunnels under an OSD Test & Evaluation/xxxxxx & xxxxxx Program.  The xxxxxxlied xxxxxxics Group at xxxxxx xxxxxxersity will be providing advisory support for computational modeling and technical support for experimental verification of free jet wind tunnel concepts.  The xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxearch Fellowship will fund the student’s research into the modeling and verification of flows that are characteristic of generic shapes associated with these concepts.The key technology of the wind tunnel is a shape-morphing throat made from a woven ceramic material.  The shape-morphing throat allows for the area ratio and thus xxxxxx number to be varied.  The particular design of the throat allows for both symmetric flows (where only the inviscid, variable xxxxxx number core is important) and asymmetric flows (where boundary layer effects and shockwave interactions are important). xxxxxx xxxxxxs:The goal of the proposed research program is to model computationally and verify experimentally the behavior of the flow through the contours and nozzle geometries associated with the shape-morphing ceramic hypersonic wind tunnel.   For example, a shape morphing free jet wind tunnel might employ either a lenticular or quadricorn shaped throat to avoid sliding seals.  Both symmetric and asymmetric flows will be investigated.  In particular, answers to the following questions will be sought:I) How robust is the response of the flow to changes in throat shape or size, the expansion contour and the length of the expansion region?II) What is the quality of the flow structures resulting from changes in throat shape or size?xxxxxx) How well do the models predict the flow properties and are there dynamic instabilities that occur due to pressure variations associated with the cusp shapes involved?IV) Is it possible to generate high quality asymmetric flows from an asymmetric opening? xxxxxxxxxxxxxx:The student will develop theoretical (analytical) and computational (computational fluid dynamics) models of the flow field downstream of the throat for purposes of predicting the flow field’s response to changes in throat shape and size.  The emphasis will be to answer questions I, II, xxxxxx and IV from a modeling standpoint.Using the hypersonic wind tunnel facilities at xxxxxx xxxxxxersity, the student will experimentally validate the theoretical and computational models by measuring the flow field with laser-based quantitative velocimetry techniques.  The goal will be to answer questions I, II, xxxxxx and IV from an experimental standpoint.It would also be highly desirable to test the shape-morphing throat at larger scales and higher enthalpies than possible with xxxxxx xxxxxxersity’s wind tunnels.  This could be accomplished by testing different throat profiles in a wind tunnel such as the Arc-Heated Scramjet Test Facility at xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx.Significance:The proposed research will demonstrate the ability of a shape-morphing ceramic hypersonic wind tunnel to provide high speed, high temperature, variable xxxxxx number, symmetric and asymmetric flow of sufficient quality to test articles.  Such a wind tunnel would allow for testing of combined cycle air breathing propulsion systems through their ramjet to scramjet mode transition.  Furthermore, the wind tunnel would also offer high enthalpy, variable xxxxxx number testing capability for non-scramjet applications such as reentry capsules, delta wings and missiles.  In general, the shape-morphing ceramic wind tunnel is expected to lead to enhanced capability for ground based test centers.	16456

Low-Loss Ferrite Components for NASA Missions, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	Ferrite based isolators and circulators have been successfully demonstrated at microwave, millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave frequencies. These components are nonreciprocal and thus highly useful for controlling standing waves and directing signal flow in frequency multiplier cascades, heterodyne, radar, radiometer, and other systems commonly deployed by xxxxxx. xxxxxxver, at the higher frequencies the performance is degraded in terms of bandwidth and loss which severely limits their usefulness.xxxxxxhough there is a demonstrable need for these components, there are relatively few vendors. Most of the commercially available components were developed more than forty years ago and there has been little effort at modernization. Recent advances reported in the literature suggest that the loss in Faraday rotation isolators can be significantly reduced. Using modern electromagnetic simulation tools, we propose to design millimeter-wave and sub-millimeter-wave ferrite components that exhibit significantly reduced loss, and improved power handling and bandwidth.Initial work on the development of a W-band isolator is underway. Ferrite cores have been manufactured and the impedance matching structures have been designed. We plan to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach within the six month timeframe of the xxxxxx xxxxxx I program. We have also successfully modeled Y-junction circulators that accurately predict performance similar to those available in the commercial market and are now working on several approaches to increase the bandwidth of these devices. A preliminary design operating at 160 GHz has been completed. In the xxxxxx I program, the design will be refined, built and tested. Beyond xxxxxx I, our goal is to develop a full line of ferrite components operating from 75 GHz to over 320 GHz with significantly improved performance over the current state-of-the-art.	16460

High Throughput Hall Thruster for Small Spacecraft, Phase II	2017-07-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx is developing a high throughput nominal xxxxxx.  This device is well sized for spacecraft ranging in size from several tens of kilograms to several hundred kilograms.  It could be fueled by either xenon or iodine.  The latter yields performance like xenon, but stores at low pressure and high density, make it especially attractive for volume limited spacecraft.  The available specific impulse will be 1400-1600-s. The target thruster efficiency is 45%.  At 100-W and 1500-s, the thrust will be 6.1 mN.  The lifetime of the thruster may exceed 10,000 hours, yielding a throughput of greater than 14.9 kg. In xxxxxx I, the thruster was designed. Design considerations included efficiency, specific impulse, temperature, lifetime, mass, volume, and cost.  Careful attention to the magnetic field resulted in a \"magnetically shielded\" shape, which should minimize or entirely eliminate ion wall losses.  xxxxxx with a nominal 200-W thruster showed the feasibility and desirability of both permanent magnets and a diamond discharge channel.  Permanent magnets save mass, volume, and power.  Diamond reduces ion sputtering by 50% with respect to conventional materials.In xxxxxx, the 100-W thruster and a compact cathode to accompany it will be manufactured, tested, and improved.  Performance, lifetime, and plume properties will be evaluated.  xxxxxx will include both xenon and iodine.  Year 2 development will focus on maximizing throughput.  xxxxxxted testing will include a compact, low cost, power processing unit. The technology will reach xxxxxx 5.The program is responsive to xxxxxx topic S3.03, Propulsion xxxxxxs. Both the \"Electric Propulsion\" and \"xxxxxx-Propulsion\" sub-topics are relevant.  The proposal also addresses several of xxxxxx xxxxxx, including Efficient In-xxxxxx Transportation, xxxxxx xxxxxx Mitigation, and Economical xxxxxx Access."	16462

High SBS-Threshold Er/Yb Co-Doped Phosphate Glass Fiber Amplifiers for High Power, Sub-us Pulsed, Narrow Linewidth, All Fiber-Based Laser Transmitter, Phase II	2012-01-01	2018-07-19	In xxxxxx I, NP Photonics has achieved 1.2 kW peak power for 105 ns fiber laser pulses, and successfully demonstrated the feasibility to produce monolithic high SBS threshold narrow linewidth fiber amplifiers for all fiber-based laser transmitters ideally suited to xxxxxx active remote sensing spectroscopy. In xxxxxx, NP Photonics proposes to develop prototypes or products of the high SBS-threshold, xxxxxx (SM), polarization maintaining (PM), high power amplifiers operating with sub-microsecond pulses and transform-limited linewidth. This is based on the successful demonstrations in xxxxxx I by using NP's proprietary patented large core SM PM highly Er/Yb co-doped phosphate glass fibers. Furthermore, in order to push the SBS threshold to the 100s kW level and to demonstrate even higher SBS threshold and improved conversion efficiency for 100-500 ns transform-limited fiber laser pulses, a new large core SM PM photonic crystal phosphate fiber 100/400 will be designed and fabricated in xxxxxx. It will be used to build the 3rd power amplifier stage in order to offer prototype/product services by achieving 10s kW peak power and 5-mJ pulse energy free of SBS effects. This will more fully enable xxxxxx active remote sensing with fiber laser pulses at 765 nm by using NP's Single Mode phosphate fiber amplifiers.	16466
Wide Bandgap Semiconductor Based Solid State Smart Circuit Protection, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxanced solid state power component technology is necessary for future hybrid aircraft systems with increased power demands. There is a need for adequate circuit protection in these high powered electrical systems to achieve safety, reliability, and ultimately airworthiness. xxxxxx State xxxxxx Controller (SSPC) modules already exist for aircraft applications but they were developed for the lower power levels seen in existing aircraft branch circuits. Hybrid-Electric aircraft have electrical power levels that are one or two orders of magnitude higher than existing aircraft and the presently existing SSPCs are simply not appropriate for use in these vehicles. SSPCs at the power levels required for a GA aircraft propulsion motor hardly exist; and SSPCs at the power levels required by small electric UAVs are too heavy and bulky. The LaunchPoint SSPC unit will incorporate all of the capabilities of existing SSPCs but with a few distinctions. LaunchPoint's SSPC will utilize xxxxxx Carbide and Gallium Nitride semiconductors to create SSPCs that are not only significantly smaller but can operate at much higher power levels. In addition to utilizing a different MOSFET element, the LaunchPoint SSPC would incorporate a microcontroller that would perform high bandwidth monitoring of current and voltage waveforms and derive low bandwidth metrics that can be reported back to the system Hybrid xxxxxx Controller. These metrics could include transient peak currents and voltages, RMS currents and voltages, and frequency content. In addition to these metrics, LaunchPoint would like to evaluate the feasibility of using the smart SSPC to detect imminent insulation failures resulting from coronal discharge, a particularly troubling problem associated with high altitude flight. This could be accomplished by real time analysis of partial discharge currents and other characteristic phenomena. These advancements represent a novel contribution to electric aircraft propulsion systems.	16467

Friction-Sensing Reflector Array Patches (FRAP), Phase II	2011-02-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxearch Support xxxxxxents, xxxxxx. (RSI) proposes to develop the Friction-Sensing Reflector Array Patches (FRAP), a technology that will measure the shear stress distribution on aerodynamic surfaces in ground test facilities with high resolution, sensitivity, and bandwidth.  Unlike the oil-film interference method, FRAP patches will not be thinned as a function of time during a test.  No knowledge of the streamlines of the flow will be needed in order to calculate the local stress distribution; this will avoid the tracers needed with the oil-film interference approach.  Flexible patches of FRAP arrays, inexpensive due to simple, mass-production-compatible microfabrication techniques, will be interrogated using a light source and camera. FRAP will be independent of the flow species and applied as a very thin, flexible, adhesive material.  xxxxxx goals will be to improve the design and fabrication of the sensors, fully calibrate taking into account competing effects such as normal forces and temperature, demonstrate feasibility in a wide range of test environments from subsonic to heated and cold supersonic, and provide prototype units to xxxxxx.  The result will be a product that will address a critical xxxxxx instrumentation need.	16469
Solar-Powered, Micron-Gap Thermophotovoltaics for MEO Applications, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	The proposed innovation is an Inxxxxxx-based, radiation-tolerant, micron-gap thermophotovoltaic (MTPV) technology.  The use of a micron wide gap between the radiation source and the photovoltaic substantially increases the efficiency of the thermophotovoltaic.  This work will be accomplished by combining xxxxxxLink's state-of-the-art Inxxxxxx-based epitaxial lift-off solar cell structure on an InP substrate, and MTPV, LLC's leading-edge, micron-gap thermophotovoltaic device technology.  The relevance of this innovation is that it addresses xxxxxx ongoing need for high-efficiency, lightweight, compact sources power for space vehicles.  TPV is an attractive and technically feasible candidate for space power supplies, but its relatively poor efficiency performance has meant that it has not seen widespread use in space applications.  xxxxxxver, MTPV technology, by bringing the emitter into the near field of the photovoltaic, couples an order of magnitude more power across the nano-scale vacuum gap than can be absorbed from the far-field spectrum and does so while maintaining the benefits of conventional TPV.  xxxxxxLink's ELO growth technology promises to further increase coupled power relative to the current germanium TPV cells while simultaneously reducing substrate costs.  Thus, xxxxxxLink ELO and MTPV technology can offer both high efficiency and reasonable cost TPV systems for the first time.	16470

Disruption Tolerant Networking	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	Traditionally, space communication systems have relied on dedicated point-to-point or single-hop relay links.&nbsp; Such links are not always available, often have long time delays, and are limited in number.&nbsp; A networked communication architecture is desired to support future space missions, as networked communications significantly increase the operational flexibility and robustness of missions, as well as enable mission classes otherwise untenable. xxxxxxver, the terrestrial Internet protocols do not work well in highly disrupted and delayed environments, and new protocols are needed.The goal of the AES Disruption Tolerant xxxxxx (DTN) project is to develop and deploy a protocol suite that extends the terrestrial Internet capabilities into highly stressed data communication environments where the conventional Internet protocols do not work well.&nbsp; The DTN protocol suite is also being internationally standardized and will enable a xxxxxxar xxxxxx Internet (SSI) architecture to support future space missions.Disruption Tolerant xxxxxx (DTN) is a protocol suite that extends the terrestrial Internet capabilities into highly stressed data communication environments where the conventional Internet does not work well. These environments are typically subject to frequent disruptions, unidirectional links, possibly long delays, and high error rates.The DTN protocol suite can run over the existing Internet Protocol (IP) suite or it can operate by itself as a full Internetworking protocol. DTN provides assured delivery of data using an automatic store-and-forward mechanism.&nbsp; The DTN suite also contains network management, security, routing, and quality-of-service mechanisms.DTN is being standardized by the Consultative Committee for xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxs (CCSDS) and the Internet xxxxxxing Task Force (IETF) and all of the DTN protocols will be open international standards, supported by open-source software.&nbsp; Several DTN implementations exist and are publically available, including xxxxxx&rsquo;s Interplanetary Overlay xxxxxx (ION) implementation (xxxxxx).	16473

An Event-based Distributed Diagnosis Framework using Structural Model Decomposition	2014-08-11	2018-07-19	Complex engineering systems require efficient on-line fault diagnosis methodologies to improve safety and reduce maintenance costs. Traditionally, diagnosis approaches are centralized, but these solutions do not scale well. Also, centralized diagnosis solutions are difficult to implement on increasingly prevalent distributed, networked embedded systems. This paper presents a distributed diagnosis framework for physical systems with continuous behavior. Using xxxxxx, a structural model decomposition method from the Artificial Intelligence model-based diagnosis (DX) community, we develop a distributed diagnoser design algorithm to build local event-based diagnosers. These diagnosers are constructed based on global diagnosability analysis of the system, enabling them to generate local diagnosis results that are globally correct without the use of a centralized coordinator. We also use xxxxxx to design local parameter estimators that are integrated with the local diagnosers to form a comprehensive distributed diagnosis framework. Hence, this is a fully distributed approach to fault detection, isolation, and identification. We evaluate the developed scheme on a four-wheeled rover for different design scenarios to show the advantages of using xxxxxx, and generate on-line diagnosis results in simulation to demonstrate the approach.	16475
ICE SOLAR WIND PLASMA ELECTRON ANALYSER DATA V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	These data were obtained from the LANL plasma experiment on ICE (Principal Investigator: xxxxxx assistance from xxxxxx and xxxxxx). The instrument measures the 2-D electron distribution function in one spacecraft rotation (3 s) once every 24 s, by obtaining 16 evenly spaced energy spectra, each with 15 contiguous levels covering the energy range 8.5 eV to 1140 eV. From these 2-D distributions the density, velocity, and temperature of the electrons are then derived. A 2-D temperature matrix is calculated which is subsequently diagonalized. Then nominally the maximum temperature corresponds to the parallel temperature and the minimum temperature corresponds to the perpendicular temperature. This is done independently of the magnetic field measurements however, the direction of maximum temperature determined in this manner is usually found to be within 15 degrees of the magnetic field direction inferred from the magnetometer measurements. The time resolution is 24 sec from the start of xxxxxx 253 (xxxxxxember 10) until xxxxxx 255 (xxxxxxember 12), 18:38. At that time the bit rate dropped from 1024 to 512 bps, and the nominal time resolution went to 48 sec.	16476

Bio-mimetic Concepts towards Next-Generation Aerospace Technology	2016-01-01	2018-07-19	Harbor Seal whisker samples were obtained from the xxxxxx Zoo for analysis using both microscopes and computed tomography (CT) to obtain an accurate 3D geometry. The geometry was then parameterized in a CAD model based on seven variables which accurately represent the whisker geometry. The new xxxxxx hardware consists of four Intel Xeon 7120A xxxxxx cards which provides access to 244 cores (4.8 teraflops) of computing resources in one office environment workstation. A novel CFD code (XFlow) is utilized which allows for very fast and accurate large eddy simulations (LES), based on the xxxxxxtice-Boltzmann method. The use of modern computing equipment coupled with innovative CFD tools allows for rapid design evaluations on the order of hundreds or even thousands of computed results. In order to automate the search for an optimal geometry, a software integration and optimization tool is used to iterate though many designs to find a set of optimal solutions.The first application of interest demonstrates that this synthetic evolution architecture does find the Harbor Seal whisker geometry to be an optimal solution based on the two objectives of minimizing the RMS vortex induced vibrations (VIV) and minimizing induced drag. The parameterized geometry initially begins as a perfect cylinder, which exhibits very poor RMS VIV and drag characteristics. After several hundred iterations driven by a global optimization routine, the optimized geometry converged to a shape very similar to the Harbor Seal whisker. This automated architecture will be implemented to drive the optimization of bio-inspired airfoils towards increased performance characteristics and lower noise signatures. The disrupted vortex shedding characteristics enhances trailing edge wake dissipation as well as shifting wake frequencies higher past the audible range.&nbsp;	16478

We will also perform a radiation-tolerance assessment and system design, and identify clear upgrade path that minimizes risk to xxxxxx. Finally, we will fabricate/test detector in a neutron/gamma environment and subject the detector to the anticipated environment.	16479
Fast Responding PSP for Rotorcraft Aerodynamic Investigations, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	"The proposed work focuses on implementing fast-response pressure-sensitive paint and xxxxxx Stress Sensitive xxxxxx for measurements of unsteady pressure and skin friction in rotorcraft applications. Significant rotorcraft problems such as dynamic stall, rotor blade loads in forward flight, and blade-vortex interaction all have significant unsteady pressure oscillations that must be resolved in order to understand the underlying physics. Often these unsteady pressures are difficult to resolve in the rotating frame due to difficult installation of pressure transducers, and data is available only at discrete points. Pressure-sensitive paint formulations have been developed to provide surface pressure information in situations such as this, but conventional PSP formulations have slow response times. Conventional skin friction measurements, for example oil flow, do not offer significant frequency response. In order to improve the frequency response characteristics of PSP, sprayed porous paint binders have been developed for measurement of unsteady pressures. Fast-responding xxxxxx Stress Sensitive xxxxxx provide both quantitative skin friction and qualitative flow visualization measurements. These techniques can provide high-spatial-resolution, time-resolved pressure and skin friction information that will provide unparalleled insight into the physical mechanisms driving certain rotorcraft problems. Both of these techniques will be demonstrated in xxxxxx State's unique 6\"x22\" transonic wind tunnel, where an airfoil may be tested for dynamic stall simulation in compressible flow. Successful demonstration of fast-responding PSP and S3F on a dynamic stall test in the 6\"x22\" tunnel will serve as a proof of concept that will allow transition of the technologies into larger-scale wind tunnels at xxxxxx and elsewhere."	16480
Soil Moisture Mapping sUAS, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	The overall technical goal of this xxxxxx is the development of a commercially viable, small xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx (sUAS) with a passive microwave sensor to enable high resolution mapping of soil moisture content. Current remote-sensing methods for sampling soil moisture often fail to provide measurements with adequate spatial and temporal resolution, or any indication of moisture content at typical root depths. This work involves the integration of existing sensor, airframe, and autopilot technologies to construct a novel sensing platform.  The scientific payload will be  a passive microwave sensor in the L-band to map soil moisture content. The airframe utilized is the Tempest, originally designed for sampling tornadic thunderstorms and is a robust, easy to operate design that can takeoff and land on unimproved surfaces. The avionics will be based on the SwiftPilot system which consists of an autopilot board, wireless link for communication, command and control, ground station, and tablet based user interface.  The SwiftPilot system provides a simple, intuitive interface for conducting sUAS missions making it ideal for scientific applications. Tight integration of the sensor with the sUAS avionics and airframe will enable precise flight control for low altitude missions in the range of 15m-30m above ground level (AGL) enabling the sensor to accurately map soil moisture with a resolution approaching 15m. The PI's working knowledge of the regulatory environment surrounding sUAS will be used to inform the development of the system and associated concept of operations. This will facilitate operation in the national airspace following FAA approval. The technical goal of this xxxxxx I proposal is to design the interfaces; mechanical, electrical, and software required for integration of the sUAS. This will include the design of experiments for testing and validating this unique sensing platform in xxxxxx to assess the the performance in the desired scientific missions.	16481

Incorporation of GNSS Multipath to Improve Autonomous Rendezvous, Docking and Proximity Operations in Space	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	Autonomous rendezvous and docking (AR&D) operations depend critically on accurate, real-time knowledge of the relative position and velocity between two space vehicles. Presently, xxxxxx Navigation xxxxxx xxxxxx (GNSS) techniques have evolved to become a source of high-integrity positioning, velocity and time (PVT) information in nearly all regimes of Earth orbit, from LEO to GEO. Unfortunately, GNSS capabilities remain severely limited in close proximity to large space structures due to significant multipath effects and signal blockage. The proposed research will investigate techniques to improve GNSS navigation in the close proximity of large space structures through the incorporation of multipath as a potential source of new range information, rather than an interference to be mitigated. This analysis is made possible by the newly acquired, full-spectrum GNSS measurements collected on xxxxxx (HSM4). This unique data set makes development of these advanced methods for space navigation possible for the first time.The 195 GB of GNSS data from STS-125 will be processed to generate waveforms for all visible satellites. Then a model of the HST-xxxxxx geometry will be constructed, employing the xxxxxx Theory of Diffraction, producing amplitude, delay and phase for each ray path to generate model correlation waveforms. These waveforms will be compared to those extracted from the raw data. The xxxxxxpath Estimating Delay Lock Loop (MEDLL) will be applied to the STS-125 data to separate the contributions from each ray path. A simplified geometry model will then be used to define the relationship between the multipath and line of sight rays. The individual delays from the MEDLL will be used to invert this geometry, estimating the relative position vector and attitude.The results of the proposed research will enable the long-term objectives outlined in the xxxxxx Communication and Navigation xxxxxxs xxxxxx, in particular those in xxxxxx Breakdown Structure (TABS) 5.4; Position, Navigation and xxxxxx (PNT).	16483

Multiple High-Fidelity Modeling Tools for Metal Additive Manufacturing Process Development, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	Despite the rapid commercialization of additive manufacturing technology such as selective laser melting, SLM, there are gaps in process modeling and material property prediction that contribute to slow and costly process qualification and product certification. To address these gaps, CFDRC and our partner Dr. xxxxxx, xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx, will develop multiple computationally efficient, high-fidelity simulation tools for the SLM process.  During xxxxxx I the team will apply adaptive meshing to enable efficient thermomechanical simulations for centimeter size test coupon builds, leverage existing multiphase flow models to analyze particle size effects on material variations, apply phase field models to predict microstructure evolution, and evaluate model predictions against experimental characterization.  During xxxxxx, the modeling tools will be extended to improve computational efficiency and scalability to aerospace component dimensions by further leveraging parallel computing and other acceleration techniques.  The fidelity of the models will be enhanced to better predict distortion, residual stress, microstructure and defects from process conditions; and additional process data will be used to validate the resulting codes.  The resulting toolset will be capable of efficiently predicting these dimensional and microstructural properties of SLM components from process conditions, while addressing important design and build features such as overhanging sections and build supports.  The high-fidelity, physics based nature of the codes will allow straightforward application to new materials, and to guiding development of and verifying analytical physics models for process control.	16489
Highly Accurate Sensor for High-Purity Oxygen Determination, Phase II	2017-03-01	2018-07-19	In this STTR effort, Los Gatos xxxxxxearch (LGR) and the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx (UW) propose to develop a highly-accurate sensor for high-purity oxygen determination.  The analyzer, which is based on LGR's patented Off-Axis ICOS technique, will be capable of rapidly quantifying high-purity oxygen (95 &#150; 100 %) with very high accuracy (better than ? 0.03 %), minimal calibration, and no zero drift.  Moreover, the sensor will require no consumables and be sufficiently compact and robust for deployment aboard xxxxxx (xxxxxx).   In xxxxxx I, LGR and UW successfully demonstrated technical feasibility by fabricating a prototype that quantified high-purity oxygen with a precision of ? 0.017 % and a 24-hour drift of less than 0.05 %.  The analyzer distinguished a 0.1 % change in highly pure oxygen and provided a linear response (R2 = 0.999997) over a wide dynamic range (0 &#150; 100 % oxygen).  The prototype was found to be accurate to 0.07 % by testing it at xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx on oxygen purified by the xxxxxx Separator for EVA xxxxxx (CASEO) project.  Due to the success of this program, LGR released a commercial O2/xxxxxx analyzer for environmental applications.   In xxxxxx, LGR and UW will refine the measurement strategy, miniaturize the hardware, ruggedize the analyzer, and test the resulting instrument.  The measurement strategy will be improved to reduce long-term drift and extended to include other species (xxxxxx, O2 isotopes, N2).  The hardware will be modified to meet the technical requirements for deployment aboard the xxxxxx (e.g. power, size, weight, and environmental specifications).  The prototype will be manufactured and tested to empirically determine its accuracy, precision, linearity, long-term drift, and time response.  Finally, the xxxxxx instrument will be delivered to researchers in xxxxxxfe Support and Habitability xxxxxxs Branch at xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxs for characterization of high-purity oxygen generators.	16490
Demonstration of Interferometric SAR Onboard Processing for Planetary Mapping Missions	2016-10-01	2018-07-19	This task is developing new method for reducing onboard data by using self focusing and fully processing the images within the instrument itself, thereby reducing the burden on the spacecraft and the downlink network by orders of magnitude. This task will enable future planetary mapping missions through a technique called interferometric synthetic aperture radar, using microwave and triangulation to create very high precision maps of extra- terrestrial bodies by orbiting spacecraft. One of the key challenges of any mapping mission is the amount of data generated by the spacecraft, and the difficulty of returning that data to earth. This task will&nbsp; develop new methods to reduce data processing onboard the spacecraft by using self focusing and fully processing the images&nbsp; within the instrument itself, thereby reducing the burden on the spacecraft and the down link network by orders of magnitude.

A Constraint-Based Geospatial Data Integration System for Wildfire Management, Phase II	2008-01-01	2018-07-19	"We propose to implement a constraint-based data integration system for wildfire intelligence, for use during both the pre-planning and event response phases of wildfire fighting.  Our system will automatically integrate online, heterogeneous data sources and hyperspectral imagery.  Current technology tends to focus mostly on the event response phases and supports only limited types of integration, usually between structured databases.  With the emergence of the Internet, there now exists an enormous number of other online information sources that can be combined with local databases and satellite imagery, including xxxxxx xxxxxx (Moderate xxxxxxolution xxxxxx) products, in order to better assist human analysis.  In this xxxxxx proposal, we will implement the constraint-based data integration system for wildfire intelligence that we designed in xxxxxx The system will allow users  to manage large amounts of data from heterogeneous sources using a single interface, to annotate and extend that data (to add a layer of \"knowledge\" on top of the data), as well as to quickly identify data updates.

Radiation responses in peripheral white blood cells of smokers and non-smokers	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	Understanding the possible impact of potential confounding factors is necessary for any approach to radiation biodosimetry. Potential confounding factors have not been fully addressed for gene expression-based biodosimetry approaches such as we are developing. To begin addressing this need we have used an ex vivo irradiated peripheral blood cell model to investigate the potential effect of smoking on the global radiation gene expression response and looked for genes that respond to radiation differently in smokers and non-smokers and also in males and females. The results indicate that only a small number of genes may be significantly confounded by either factor supporting the idea of developing peripheral blood gene expression strategies for radiation biodosimetry. Blood from each of 24 different donors was exposed to four doses of ionizing radiation (0 0.1 0.5 or xxxxxx) and analyzed using single-color microarray hybridization. The donors represented equal numbers of male and female smokers (1 or more packs a day) and non-smokers. There are 95 data sets in the study as the sample from one of the female smokers exposed to xxxxxx was lost.	16498
Advanced Control Method for Hypersonic Vehicles	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	This research effort aims to develop software control algorithms that will correct for roll reversal before it happens. Roll reversal occurs when an aircraft is steered in one direction but rolls the opposite way due to aerodynamic conditions. The problem often compounds as a pilot attempts to correct for the motion by over-steering in the original direction, leading to uncontrollable roll. Unexpected yaw and subsequent roll reversal has caused the loss of high-speed, lifting body&ndash;like vehicles. The team has employed novel predictive software within adaptive controller technology to detect conditions likely to result in aircraft roll reversal and then automate compensating maneuvers to avoid catastrophic loss.Work completed: xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx&rsquo;s retrospective cost model refinement (RCMR) control algorithm has been integrated into a flight simulator and tested with prerecorded, open-source parameter data, which replicates the roll reversal anomaly.Looking ahead: Next steps involve upgrading the RCMR code to account for a six-degree-of-simulation environment (forward/back, up/ down, left/right, pitch, yaw, and roll) with eventual application in a flight test environment.Partners: xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx, other government research agencies, and aerospace firms.Benefits Operates independently: Unlike other standard control systems, this method allows for compensation and control of aircraft roll reversal without a priori knowledge of the dynamics.Improves safety: This technology is expected to prevent crashes that occur due to uncontrolled roll.xxxxxxreases envelope: RCMR would enable planes to travel safely over a larger envelope.xxxxxx Hypersonic jetsxxxxxxing body&ndash;type space vehicles and reentry vehicles	16499

Mechanics of Digital Lattice Materials for Re-configurable Space Structures	2020-08-01	2018-07-19	Because of the challenges associated with the inability to resupply for repair, future deep space exploration missions will require innovative material and structural solutions to achieve lighter, stronger, more reliable, and more multifunctional structures. Digital lattice materials offer a unique approach to achieving these goals, generating from discrete parts lattice solids that behave as continuum materials. Such materials have shown extraordinary strength and stiffness properties at ultralow density, are reconfigurable, and allow customization of material properties based on control of lattice substructure. Despite demonstration of these properties, the failure mechanisms, fracture toughness, and fatigue properties of these materials are not well understood. Characterization of these properties is critical for safe and efficient implementation of these materials in critical load bearing applications. This project seeks to not only characterize the fundamental fracture and fatigue scaling laws associated with digital lattice materials of cuboctahedral structure, but also investigate novel macrostructural toughening mechanisms. In additional, because the potential for reconfigurablity is a primary advantage of these materials in deep space (where material lifecycle is of critical importance), this research will also investigate appropriate characterization of material fracture and fatigue properties for reconfigured digital lattice structures. Experimental investigation will utilize standard fatigue and fracture specimens (3 point bend notched specimen) to compare the behavior of digital lattice materials to other cellular solids. These will also be compared to similar tests that investigate the influence of macroscopic toughening features designed into the lattice on fracture and fatigue performance. Finally, similar tests will be used to verify the ability to predict degraded fracture and fatigue properties associated with reconfigured material that has be pre-cycled. The results of this work will be in direct support of xxxxxx Technological xxxxxx xxxxxx 12 by investigating novel approaches to increasing the toughness (and therefore reliability) of ultra-lightweight structures. Such work is also critical for designing appropriate health monitoring strategies. Finally, ability to predict the degraded properties of reconfigured material is a key enabling technology material recyclability that could revolutionize material and structural life cycles in space applications.	16504
Sealed Planetary Return Canister (SPRC), Phase II	2013-12-01	2018-07-19	Sample return missions have primary importance in future planetary missions. A basic requirement is that samples be returned in pristine, uncontaminated condition, necessitating development of a canister system capable of maintaining cleanliness and seal integrity through a variety of environments. Further development of the Sealed xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx (SPRC), is proposed after a successful xxxxxx program. Besides providing a high integrity seal, the canister incorporates features for robotic manipulation and to allow the sample to be accessed in a controlled manner upon return to Earth. The SPRC seal system addresses the two most significant concerns for planetary samples  seal surfaces contaminated by the sample and high pressure due to the phase change of volatiles. The SPRC incorporates a novel sealing system evolved from the only marginally successful xxxxxx indium knife edge seal approach but with added features to address the difficulties and inconsistencies observed. The indium is contained within a protective barrier to prevent against contamination, and the knife edge is mechanically cleaned during the sealing process. The container body can be configured to accommodate a variety of samples including rock cores, rock fragments, regolith, dust, and frozen soil. Atmospheric samples can also be preserved. The design is readily scalable and adaptable to specific missions. The prototype developed in xxxxxx demonstrated a leakage rate of less than 1e-6 cc-atm/s, meeting the primary science requirement.	16505
Modeling and Control Methods for Supporting Scapulohumeral Rhythm with a Robotic Exoskeleton	2020-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx activities (EVA), which are activities that require a crew member to leave the spacecraft, are a key component of many missions and require a substantial amount of preparation. Unfortunately, previous studies have shown that astronauts that are trained to carry out EVA have a significant incidence rate for shoulder injuries while wearing the protective spacesuit. A large percentage of these injuries occur during training prior to the mission, and a substantial portion of these require surgical intervention. A statistical analysis of the factors that may contribute to shoulder injuries identified that the current version of the Hard Upper Torso (HUT) in the spacesuit is strongly associated with astronauts developing shoulder issues. In order to make improve the design of the spacesuit, engineers need a thorough understanding of how the current HUT affects shoulder motion.This understanding can be obtained by applying musculoskeletal modeling techniques. Musculoskeletal modeling is a type of dynamic simulation that models how the human muscles and bones move to accomplish some task. I will use these types of models to understand how the spacesuit affects astronaut shoulder motion. My proposed research will consist of modeling the human-suit interactions in a one-g environment with an improved musculoskeletal model, simulating how these interactions change when the crew member performing underwater training, and comparing the results from the previous parts with simulations using a redesigned HUT.The musculoskeletal models I will use will be developed in OpenSim, an open-source software that already has a number of models for different parts of the human body. My musculoskeletal model will make improvements to an existing model by adding missing muscles and ligaments for a more complete description of the shoulder physiology. I will measure how the astronauts move with the current spacesuit using an optical motion capture system, and I will add various resistive loads that are associated with the suit's mass and joint stiffness. This model will be expanded on by including fluid forces that occur when astronauts performing EVA training in a submerged environment. These studies will provide information on how astronauts recruit their muscles to perform different tasks, as well as how shoulder posture and muscle forces relate to the likelihood of shoulder injury during EVA training. This information will be used to create hypothetical suit redesigns that can be used in the simulations to compare how shoulder motion differs between different HUT geometries.This research is important to several areas that are related to EVA mobility and astronaut health. First, quantifying the suit resistance, joint loads, and associated shoulder motion are vital to future redesigns of the EMU in order to reduce crew injury rates and increase the suit's mobility. This work will be important for astronaut medicine, as the information on muscle use and joint loads during EVA training can improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment potential shoulder problems. In addition, if future spacesuits incorporate technologies that allow for strength augmentation (such as those found in existing upper body exoskeletons), this information on joint forces and muscle use is necessary to ensure that these devices do not injure crew members.	16506
Radiation Hard Wide Temperature Range Mixed-Signal Components, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Low temperature survivability, high performance and radiation tolerance of electronics in combination is required for xxxxxx surface missions. xxxxxx sub-micron CMOS circuits operate at low power supply voltages and offer a very large scale of integration and compatibility with automated design tools at gigabit/second data rates. Unfortunately, their power consumption significantly increases at higher frequencies and single-ended architectures are associated with switching noise and duty cycle distortion. They are also highly susceptible to radiation effects and not suitable for extreme temperatures. On the other hand, differential current-switching circuits utilizing hetero-junction bipolar transistors (HBTs) overcome all named problems but suffer from high supply voltages and DC currents. Our company proposes to develop a set of high-performance, power-efficient, wide temperature range, radiation-hard mixed-signal components representing modifications of the company's existing commercial products. The designs will be based on the proprietary library of CML current switches utilizing HBTs from a commercial BiCMOS technology and will operate within temperature range from -200oC to +140oC and TID&gt;1xxxxxx. The list of products will include high-speed reprogrammable serializers and deserializers, active delay lines, trans-impedance amplifiers, sample and hold devices, VCSEL drivers, etc. Mission critical ASICs will be analyzed during xxxxxx I and fabricated in xxxxxx.	16507
Vehicle-Level Reasoning Systems:  Integrating System-Wide data to Estimate Instantaneous Health State	2012-01-27	2018-07-19	One of the primary goals of xxxxxxted Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) is to detect, diagnose, predict, and mitigate adverse events during the flight of an aircraft, regardless of the subsystem(s) from which the adverse event arises. To properly address this problem, it is critical to develop technologies that can integrate large, heterogeneous (meaning that they contain both continuous and discrete signals), asynchronous data streams from multiple subsystems in order to detect a potential adverse event, diagnose its cause, predict the effect of that event on the remaining useful life of the vehicle, and then take appropriate steps to mitigate the event if warranted. These data streams may have highly xxxxxx distributions and can also contain discrete signals such as caution and warning messages which exhibit non-stationary and obey arbitrary noise models. At the aircraft level, a Vehicle-xxxxxx Reasoning xxxxxx (VLRS) can be developed to provide aircraft with at least two significant capabilities:  improvement of aircraft safety due to enhanced monitoring and reasoning about the aircraft’s health state, and also potential cost savings through Condition xxxxxx xxxxxx (CBM).  Along with the achieving the benefits of CBM, an important challenge facing aviation safety today is safeguarding against system- and component-level failures and malfunctions. xxxxxx:  xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and xxxxxx, “Vehicle xxxxxx Reasoning xxxxxxs:  Concept and Future Directions,” Society of Automotive xxxxxxs xxxxxxted Vehicle Health Management Book, Ian Jennions, Ed., 2011.	16508

Additively Manufactured Monolithic Catalyst Bed for Green Propellants, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	This proposal aims to develop a low cost, high efficiency catalyst technology to address navigation and maneuver difficulties in xxxxxx return missions. Our approach takes advantage of two recent innovations in the space industry regarding green monopropellants and additive manufacturing (AM). In the proposed project, we are to design and fabricate a monolithic catalyst bed using selective laser melting (SLM) technology and begin to optimize its catalytic performance with new green monopropellants like AF-M315E and LMP-103S.  The overwhelming advances that these two areas have seen in the last few years are making it possible to offer a novel solution to the problems that robotic exploration missions are currently facing. Our proposed solution will enhance thruster life, decrease the risk of catalyst bed failure, and lower the cost of green monopropellant subsystems used in small spacecraft.Our proposed project has two main objectives.  First, we will demonstrate the additive manufacture of a monolithic W-Re catalyst substrate that combines high flow area and high internal surface area, to insure high reactivity and low pressure drop.  Then, we will begin to develop a thorough understanding of the HAN and ADN chemical behavior at a molecular level, in order to precisely tailor the Ir/Pt/Re catalyst material formulation for maximum catalytic reactivity.	16511

In this xxxxxx project, we propose to investigate robust image reconstruction based on novel signal processing techniques in the vein of compressed sensing (CS) to mitigate pixel damage to the point that is imperceptible by the human eye. Specifically, this proposal is a response to the solicitation for radiation-hardened programmable encoding technology as an identified mid-term xxxxxx solution. CS is a recently introduced novel framework that goes against the traditional data acquisition paradigm. CS demonstrates that a sparse, or compressible, signal can be acquired using a low rate acquisition process that projects the signal onto a small set of vectors incoherent with the sparsity basis. This approach is divided into encoder and decoder stages.  We propose performing the encoding in-line with acquisition using a low-SWaP, radiation-tolerant FPGA. The robust reconstruction will occur back on Earth where high-performance GPU-accelerated workstations can be used.  A benefit of our solution is that it does not require a modification to the original imaging system."	16513
Reduced Order Aeroservoelastic Models with Rigid Body Modes, Phase II	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	Complex aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic phenomena can be modeled on complete aircraft configurations generating models with millions of degrees of freedom. xxxxxxing from a freely supported version of the model, a two-step model reduction process is proposed to create aeroelastic models that include rigid body dynamics. In the first step, proper orthogonal decomposition at a set of flight conditions reduces the model order from millions to hundreds of degrees of freedom. In the second step, a linear matrix inequality further reduces the order and creates a linear parameter varying reduced order model. The model includes a trimmed and parameterized description of aeroelastic forces valid over a region of the flight envelop. The same model can be used for rapid simulation and for linear parameter varying flight control design. Feasibility of this two-step process has been demonstrated in the xxxxxx I work and a plan has been developed for a prototype implementation. Specific improvements to the rigid body model, technical risks in the development effort, and a risk reduction plan have been identified. An X-56A vehicle model will be developed and then used to demonstrate the model reduction process and to demonstrate applications including a linear parameter varying flight control system.	16514

Differential Diode Laser Sensor for High-Purity Oxygen, Phase I	2012-02-01	2018-07-19	A compact portable sensor for determining the purity of oxygen concentrations near 100 percent is proposed based on differential absorption of two beams from a diode laser. One beam passes through a cell containing the sample of gas to be analyzed and the second beam passes through a reference cell containing a known concentration of high-purity oxygen. An autobalanced detection system will be used for measuring the difference in photocurrents of the transmitted beams. Common mode noise such as laser intensity noise will be rejected to a high degree. The system should not be subject to drift because it would be possible to lock the laser wavelength to the oxygen line using the reference cell. We estimate that the proposed sensor concept should enable an accuracy of 0.05 percent to be achieved with a cell length of less than 10 cm. The sensor can be made rugged with a small footprint using microelectronics for laser control and signal processing. The proposed effort will test the feasibility of this sensor concept by seeking to demonstrate measurements of the desired accuracy using a breadboard system.	16516

This approach enables the changing of parameter rates on researcher need live through a flight test mission. We will evaluate different approaches of the Publish xxxxxx messaging paradigm to what fits the requirements of our range assets, aircraft embedded systems, and operational considerations.

Standardization of Fault Management Techniques and Activities with TEAMS, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx (FM) is a key enabler of system autonomy critical to reducing overall operations costs of increasingly complex science missions while ensuring their success. xxxxxx has invested significant effort and has developed a draft FM xxxxxxbook to improve FM design, development, xxxxxx and operations processes. While the FM xxxxxxbook provides rules and guidelines, those can be effectively followed for realizing the above mentioned goals with the aid of advanced xxxxxx xxxxxxs xxxxxxing (MBSE) software tools. xxxxxx uses a variety of such tools to conduct its FM activities. xxxxxxver, these tools are varied and disjoint, and often require manual intervention to transfer data from the output of one tool to the input of another. This process is tedious and error-prone and scales poorly for large, complex systems. This prevents SHM engineers from gaining insight into the overall system level design and characteristics that are key to transparency, verifiability and efficiency of implementing and testing FM. To address these challenges QSI-xxxxxx team plans to develop techniques and concomitant software tools to (1) capture diverse and disjoint data products and multi-domain modeling information into TEAMS for standardizing FM xxxxxx and Activities, (2) conduct Architecture Trade Studies focusing on failure detection (abort trigger) effectiveness with corresponding sensor suite selection, and (3) introduce ancillary capabilities in TEAMS to support the main tasks such as assessment of Failure Effect Propagation timing (FEPT). The proposed effort seeks to aid the evaluation and xxxxxx of FM of system(s) in multiple usage scenarios through utilizing existing capabilities and introducing added capabilities to TEAMS for the computation and evolution of relevant FM analyses. The added capabilities include information integration; extending the system modeling capabilities; and assessing the effect of implementing diagnostic decisions on overall functionality of the system.	16528

Achromatic Vector Vortex Waveplates for Coronagraphy, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Diffractive waveplates are optical components made of thin films ofanisotropic materials by modulating their optical axis orientation inthe plane of the waveplate. The family of diffractive waveplates whereinthis modulation is axially symmetric  vector vortex waveplates (VVWs)impart a spiral phase modulation at a light beam propagated through thewaveplate. As a result, the intensity of radiation is sharply decreasedat the axis of the beam by many orders of magnitude, depending on thetopological charge and quality of the VVW. Such transparent phasecomponents can be successfully employed in coronagraphy allowing imagingof exoplanets at diffraction angle limit of their separation from thebright host star using small aperture telescopes, and they will allowincreasing the imaging capability of large telescopes. To achieve thispotential, VVWs shall possess with negligibly small singularity size (~2 micrometer) and be spectrally broadband in a large aperture (~ 25 mm).We propose to prove the feasibility of developing such components basedon azobenzene photoalignment materials, liquid crystal polymers, and theoptical printing technology that employs linear-to-axial polarizationconversion.

Numerical Simulation of Rocket Exhaust Interaction with Lunar Soil, Phase II	2010-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx plume impingement can cause significant damage and contaminate co-landing spacecraft and surrounding habitat structures during lunar landing operations. CFDRC and the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx will develop an innovative simulation system for predicting surface erosion and debris transport caused by lunar surface rocket plume impingement. This simulation system combines 1) a unified continuum-rarefied flow solver capable of simulating plume impingement flow in lunar vacuum, 2) granular solid-fluid interaction simulation models for developing databases for lunar soil erosion and debris particle release mechanism, and 3) particle tracking tools to simulate debris kinetics and dispersion after liberation. During xxxxxx I, the Unified Flow xxxxxxver (UFS) capabilities in simulating hybrid rarefied-continuum plume flow, and the debris dispersion tracking capabilities were demonstrated. The fluid-solid simulation tools realistically simulated jet induced soil grain response characteristics, clearing the path towards establishing working models of erosion and particle release mechanisms. In xxxxxx, the individual modules will be refined, validated and integrated into a coherent simulation system. The solid-fluid interaction physics will be refined for the peculiar lunar soil layer characteristics and consequently soil erosion models will be derived. The erosion models will serve to prescribe debris initial conditions for a debris-tracking module developed and integrated with the flow solver. The simulation capability will be essential for predicting the severity and range of dust and debris transport and for designing lunar settlement layout, dust and debris impact mitigation measures.	16533

Hydrogen-rich Interpenetrating Polymer Networks for Radiation-Shield Structures, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	In xxxxxx-topic H11.01, xxxxxx has identified a need for advanced radiation-shielding materials and structures to protect humans from space radiation during xxxxxx missions.  The radiation species of greatest interest are light ions (particularly protons), heavy ions (such as iron-56) and neutrons.  International xxxxxxentific Technologies, xxxxxx., in conjunction with The College of William and Mary, proposes the development of hydrogen-rich interpenetrating polymer networks as radiation shields. The program Technical xxxxxxs include selection and design of interpenetrating polymer networks for use in radiation shields, synthesis of interpenetrating polymer networks tailored to function as radiation shields as well as structural components, and measurement and test of interpenetrating polymer network materials for radiation-shielding effectiveness and other multifunctional properties.

Bioinspired Broadband Antireflection Coatings at Long Wavelengths for Space Applications	2016-03-01	2018-07-19	The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation observation is the primary tool for determining the global properties, content, and history of the universe. One efficient way to increase the detection sensitivity of future CMB measurement instruments is to use refractive optics due to the improved detection efficiency and the reduced space, weight, and cost. At long wavelengths from far infrared to millimeter, silicon is a superior material for manufacturing refractive optics because of its excellent transmission and low dispersion. xxxxxxver, due to its very high refractive index, silicon optics suffers from a 30% reflection loss per silicon-air interface. We will develop a new broadband antireflection coating technology inspired by the periodic nanostructures found on the cornea of a moth's eye. The resulting coatings can significantly reduce optical reflection from silicon refractive optics over a wide range of long wavelengths and incident angles.	16538
Hydroxyl Tagging Velocimetry for Rocket Plumes, Phase II	2012-04-01	2018-07-19	A non-intrusive method for measuring velocities in a rocket exhaust is proposed in a joint effort by Metroxxxxxx and xxxxxx xxxxxxersity. xxxxxx (HTV) uses an ultraviolet laser to tag a region of the flow with OH molecules, and interrogates them after a short delay with a second laser to obtain velocity from time-of-flight data. The method relies on the dissociation of xxxxxx molecules naturally present in the flow, and thus requires no seeding. Being an all-optical technique, it is not adversely affected by high temperatures or high dynamic pressures. Analyses and experiments conducted during the xxxxxx I effort demonstrated feasibility by showing that OH tag lifetimes in a simulated rocket exhaust environment were sufficiently long to enable accurate determination of tag displacements corresponding to typical rocket exhaust velocities. The method was demonstrated by measuring velocities in the exhaust gases of a laboratory scale burner at temperatures and chemical compositions representative of a H2/O2 rocket exhaust. Design tradeoff studies predicted that at measurement ranges of 20 to 50 feet the accuracies would be from two to five percent. This proposal outlines a plan to develop a prototype HTV instrument and demonstrate it in a rocket engine exhaust.	16539
A Compact, High-Precision Optical Payload Enabling Earth-Sized Exoplanet Detection Using Nanosatellites	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	The objective of the proposed research program is to design, build, test, and fly a compact, high-precision optical payload that is compatible with nanosatellite platforms. xxxxxx (i.e. spacecraft weighing less than approximately 10 kg) hold the promise of low-cost access to space and more rapid development. On the other hand, nanosatellites impose severe mass, volume, and power constraints that make cutting-edge science difficult without additional technology development. Such a technology development is the subject of this proposal, encompassing optical design, integrated simulation, and model-based systems engineering. The proposed payload would fly as part of ExoplanetSat, a 3U CubeSat space telescope designed to detect transiting xxxxxxsize exoplanets bright, xxxxxx-like stars. Specific activities to be performed as part of this program are the development of a composite focal plane array combining CMOS and CCD imaging sensors for guide star tracking and science measurements, respectively; optimizing the sensor for high performance in the absence of active thermal control; developing a custom lens to serve as the optical telescope element; and creating a new tool that facilitates model-based systems engineering (MBSE) for small satellites. This work is significant to xxxxxx in that the proposed technology development will allow low-cost platforms (e.g. xxxxxx) to conduct meaningful science within their strict size, mass, and power constraints.

Innovations in Understanding and Modeling Cryogenic Propellants for Long-Duration Spaceflight	2017-11-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx exploration by humans and robots benefits from optimization of many systems. Design of cryogenic rocket systems, typically using liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen or liquid methane, is crucial to do as well as possible so as to be able to deliver the space vehicle to where the exploration and scientific research can occur. Warming of these chilled propellants shortens mission lifetimes, drives up cost, and, when poorly controlled, prohibits us from even attempting some missions. This research focuses on delivering much-needed improvements to how we model the heat transfer processes, such as warming and the use of chillers, with cryogenic propellants. xxxxxx ground-based experiments along with detailed computer modeling of evaporation, condensation, motion, and heat transfer in the liquid and vapor phases are combined to open up the details of how fast these propellants move heat and mass around the fuel tanks in space by evaporation and condensation.

Controlled Thermal Expansion Alloys	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	There has always been a need for controlled thermal expansion alloys suitable for mounting optics and detectors in spacecraft applications.&nbsp; These alloys help provide the stability required to capture the stunning images we have come to expect from our observatories and satellites such as xxxxxx (HST) and the series of Geostationary Operational Environmental xxxxxxs (xxxxxx), and those we hope to see with the xxxxxx (JWST), Next xxxxxxration X-ray Observatory (NGXO), xxxxxxanced xxxxxx Large-Aperture xxxxxx xxxxxx (ATLAST) and others.&nbsp; Without them, the precision instruments on these spacecraft would produce blurred images and low resolution spectra. &nbsp;In practice, these alloys would be fashioned into support structures for optics or detector baseplates, and their compositions designed to match the dimensional change over a given temperature range to minimize distortion due to thermal mismatch stresses.&nbsp; This effort addressed the need to invent a process to design an alloy that performs to a specific coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) requirement.&nbsp; Of particular interest is the lower CTE range where silicon, as well as many of the glasses we use for optics, are required to perform. This first part of this effort investigated the iron-nickel binary system with varying nickel content over a range of CTE from 0.6ppm/&deg;C to 10.0ppm/&deg;C.&nbsp; xxxxxxure 1 shows a comparison of calculated values of room temperature CTE for binary Fe-f(Ni) alloys based on the two gamma state ferromagnetic model for the face-centered cubic Fe-Ni austenite matrix, with one-hundred year old data from the experimental work of Guillaume.&nbsp; Both the calculation and the early experimental data indicate that the CTE of Fe-Ni binary alloys vary continuously with nickel content in a smooth and predictable manner.The second part of this effort determined experimentally the functional relationship between Ni content and CTE for the binary Fe-Ni system.&nbsp; This was achieved by manufacturing a series of test alloys using high-precision melt metallurgical techniques.&nbsp; The test alloys were heat treated by xxxxxx&rsquo;s (GSFC) Materials xxxxxxing Branch (MEB) and CTE coupons were machined by GSFC&rsquo;s xxxxxxanced xxxxxx Branch.&nbsp; xxxxxx was measured as a function of temperature from 300K to 23K using the MEB interferometer.&nbsp; xxxxxxure 2 shows an example of a secant CTE calculated from these microstrain measurements over the temperature range 10&deg;C to 30&deg;C.	16553

In this effort we provide the precise geometric specifications and margins for a passive capillary fluidic LAD for cryogenic fluid management for in-space transportation. We will provide design tools such that dimensions may be tuned to adapt to changes in requirements, propellants, tank geometry, materials, flight, etc. We will employ the SE-FIT software to determine all a/symmetric global minimizing surfaces and myriad stability limits as functions of acceleration environment magnitude and orientation with special considerations for orbit and coast with drag, gravity gradient, spacecraft mass center, and self-gravitation. We will confirm predictions with experiments performed employing accurately-scaled devices in a drop tower. Our long term commercial interest is the broad deployment of our method to design highly configurable devices for a broad range of commercial aerospace tankage uses.	16555

Due to the actuating mechanism and modular design, SASA will be able to scale to be used in a variety of satellite bus (regular satellites to smallsats).  This study aims to develop different control algorithms and a high fidelity hardware in the loop platform to test the control algorithms for a scaled SASA prototype. The study would conclude with testing and verifying the control response for the prototype, thereby increasing reliability of the SASA platform promoting it to xxxxxx 4. xxxxxx xxxxxx of this project would test the SASA platform in vomit comets and culminate with a test flight on a CubeSat platform to prove flight worthiness (CAPSat).	16556
Universal Docking Interface for Free-Flying Robots, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	Currently, no universal electromechanical engagement interface exists for free-flying robots, limiting their ability to dock, perch, recharge, change tools, manipulate payloads, and assemble in modular structures for intravehicular, extravehicular, and planetary surface operations. xxxxxx (xxxxxx) proposes to develop a xxxxxxersal xxxxxx xxxxxx (UDI) that provides a common electromechanical connection architecture for free-flying robots. The UDI will enhance capabilities to mount and manipulate tools, sensors, payloads; dock for power and data transfer; perch for short- or long-term storage; and create new modular structures for intravehicular, extravehicular, and surface tasks in support of commercial operations and human spaceflight. The UDI will be based on xxxxxx's existing solutions for robotic satellite servicing and planetary rover recharge , modified to meet xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Mission Directorate (STMD) Human Exploration Telerobotics requirements. This reliable plug-and-play docking and manipulation interface will provide an electromechanical quick-connect/disconnect for tools, sensors, and other payloads, as well as enabling truly modular assembly in microgravity. The proposed xxxxxx effort will perform a detailed investigation of tool change, sensor payload interface, manipulation and docking requirements for free-flying robots supporting missions on-orbit, to xxxxxx, the xxxxxx, or NEOs. xxxxxx requirements such as mate/de-mate cycles, stiffness, strength, repeatability, misalignment tolerance, human safety, debris mitigation, and electrical feedthrough characteristics will be derived through contact with potential end users to characterize potential use cases and future mission payloads.	16557
Hybrid Computational Model for High-Altitude Aeroassist Vehicles, Phase II	2008-11-01	2018-07-19	The proposed effort addresses a need for accurate computational models to support aeroassist and entry vehicle system design over a broad range of flight conditions including direct entry and aerocapture trajectories for manned and unmanned earth return and planetary exploration.  These models are critical for assessing aerodynamic characteristics including reaction control systems (RCS) influences and for designing thermal protection systems involving both ablating and non-ablating materials.  A hybrid approach unifying continuum CFD and rarefied xxxxxx flow solvers will be developed that can handle both higher altitude continuum flows, i.e. 60~85km, with embedded rarefied zones such as the base/near-wake region as well as higher altitude rarefied flows with embedded continuum zones such as RCS jet plumes. The proposed model will automatically separate continuum and rarefied regions into distinct computational domains employing a unique methodology demonstrated in xxxxxx I to construct hybrid interface surfaces for complex three-dimensional geometries.  The model will incorporate RCS jet and advanced ablative models and will provide consistent nonequilibrium thermochemical modeling between the CFD and xxxxxx solutions.  This methodology provides a more efficient and accurate tool than provided by continuum CFD or xxxxxx alone and provides the flexibility to address a wide range of vehicle and system designs.	16558
Workflow Based Software Development Environment, Phase II	2006-11-01	2018-07-19	The goal of this proposed research is to investigate and develop a workflow based tool, the Software xxxxxxers Assistant, to facilitate the collaboration between different participants of multiple activities within a Software xxxxxxment xxxxxxess. Distributed development teams are becoming the norm for today?s software projects. These distributed teams are faced with the challenge of keeping software projects on track and keeping all involved developers using a consistent and efficient process. Workflow tools have been used for several years to support activities of distributed organizations such as xxxxxx Program. Workflow tools are efficient at automating very constrained and tightly controlled processes such as xxxxxxe Requests processes. A Software xxxxxxment xxxxxxess, though, requires a more informal type of process automation allowing the project manager more control rather than enforcing tight rules through the workflow engine. Issues to be addressed during this project include researching the effects of multiple factors involved in the successful insertion of this technology within xxxxxx organizations. Engine characteristics required to give flexibility to the software development team will be researched. xxxxxx processes will be captured within the workflow tool to evaluate different needs of process participants, such as Project Management, xxxxxx, Design, Implementation, and xxxxxx.	16559
Surface Optimization Techniques for Deployable Reflectors, Phase II	2012-04-01	2018-07-19	Under this and several other programs, CTD has developed TEMBOREG deployable solid-surface reflectors (TEMBOREG Reflectors) to provide future xxxxxx and  Air Force missions and commercial communications satellites with large RF apertures that can operate at very high operational frequencies (Ka band and above). TEMBOREG Reflectors incorporate non-tensioned graphite composite membranes that are formed using conventional construction techniques and stiffened using CTD's TEMBOREG shape-memory composite panels to allow practical packaging and deployment without complex mechanisms.  The simplicity of the design provides a significant cost advantage when compared to existing deployable reflector technologies, (4-fold cost reduction over mesh antenna and 2-fold reduction in manufacturing time) and the continuous graphite surface enables high frequency antenna operations at Ka band and above.  CTD can stow either a Cassegrainian (center-fed) or Gregorian (offset-fed) 5m TEMBOREG Reflectors in a Falcon 1e launch vehicle. To moderate cost and fabrication time, the TEMBOREG reflector is supported by a deployable backing structure.  In the proposed xxxxxx effort, CTD will further refine innovative backing structure developed in xxxxxx I as well as to develop additional precision capability to enable both the high frequency (Ka band and above), large aperture (5 to 8 meters) performance required for near-term and future xxxxxx programs.	16560

Bystander response to 2.5 Gy of protons in a human 3-dimensional skin model in 16 h after exposure	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	Bystander mechanisms that originate in the areas surrounding a tissue damage presumably play an important role participating in wound healing and tissue remodeling. Thus identification and characterization of bystander mechanisms will help to development of new treatments of patients with a radiation exposure. In the present study we irradiated 3-dimensional tissue model of human epidermis Epi-200 (Mat-Tek xxxxxxland MA) with 2.5 Gy protons. By exposing only a thin strip across the center of the EPI-200 tissue we have been able to measure global gene expression responses in directly irradiated and bystander cells located at 0.125-0.375 0.375-0.625 0.625-875 mm from the irradiation line. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array xxxxxx (NIH) and further gene ontology analysis and network analysis was performed with Panther (xxxxxxlied xxxxxxsystems) and IPA (Ingenuity) accordingly. Significantly responding genes were identified at all distances and included sets common to both direct and bystander responses. xxxxxx discovery rate in bystander samples did not exceed 20% (p=0.001) and was sufficiently low in the samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure (0.06-1.16%). xxxxxx of the fragments cut at the same distance revealed 52 54 and 88 differentially expressed genes. These gene lists overlapped each other had from 3 to 12 genes in common including CLED2 S100A7A. xxxxxx obtained after the whole tissue exposure discovered 949 differentially expressed genes. Moreover the performed gene ontology analysis showed there overrepresentation of TP53 pathway (pathways p=2.04E-02) a common marker of direct irradiation response and also overrepresentation of the following groups of genes: signal transduction (p=4.52E-04) cell communication (p=1.24E-04) and cell cycle in the category of biological processes; DNA helicase activity (p=2.54E-07) receptor binding (p=6.19E-04) calcium ion binding proteins (p=2.57E-03) as the molecular functions. Differentially expresses genes of bystander samples had few categories in common such as cell communication (p=2.36E-03) and signal transduction (p=2.42E-03) among the biological processes and receptor activity (p=4.54E-03) among the molecular functions. Categories specific for the bystander samples included G-protein coupled receptors (p=7.24E-03) and ligand-gated ion channels (p=4.16E-03) suggesting a role of external stimulation and ion trafficking in bystander mechanisms. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model Epi-200 was measured in 16 hours after exposure to 2.5 Gy of protons. Four independent experiments were performed for the samples collected at different distances from the irradiation line (125-375 375-625 and 625-875 micrometers) using three tissue fragments per a data point. Moreover three sets of whole tissue irradited samples were also generated for 0 and 2.5 Gy (6 samples total) and used for comparison of bystander and direct responses.	16563
Towards a Framework for Evaluating and Comparing Diagnosis Algorithms	2010-11-22	2018-07-19	xxxxxx inference involves the detection of anomalous system behavior and the identification of its cause, possibly down to a failed unit or to a parameter of a failed unit. Traditional approaches to solving this problem include expert/rule-based, model-based, and data-driven methods. Each approach (and various techniques within each approach) use different representations of the knowledge required to perform the diagnosis. The sensor data is expected to be combined with these internal representations to produce the diagnosis result. In spite of the availability of various diagnosis technologies, there have been only minimal efforts to develop a standardized software framework to run, evaluate, and compare different diagnosis technologies on the same system. This paper presents a framework that defines a standardized representation of the system knowledge, the sensor data, and the form of the diagnosis results – and provides a run-time architecture that can execute diagnosis algorithms, send sensor data to the algorithms at appropriate time steps from a variety of sources (including the actual physical system), and collect resulting diagnoses. We also define a set of metrics that can be used to evaluate and compare the performance of the algorithms, and provide software to calculate the metrics.	16564
ASTEROID PROPER ELEMENTS V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	Proper elements of asteroids are derived from the osculating orbital elements by correcting for the perturbations of the major planets to arrive at elements which are stable over time periods comparable to the age of the solar system. The purpose of computing proper elements is twofold, to detect asteroid 'families', which are dynamically related groupings of asteroids potentially of common origin, and to understand the dynamical structure of the asteroid belt.	16565
An Ultra-Sensitive, Size Resolved Particle Mass Measurement Device, Phase II	2012-06-01	2018-07-19	By providing size resolved compositional information, the xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx (AMS) has greatly advanced understanding of aircraft particulate matter (PM) emissions. AMS data have been critical to much of our understanding of aircraft PM emissions, but in the past it has had limited utility in probing the smallest (<100 nm) particles in the exhaust. Also, prior to this work the AMS has been able to detect only volatile PM and other instruments have been required to characterize the non-volatile (soot). During xxxxxx I, we: 1) developed an improved computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model to simulate the performance of the AMS for <100 particles; 2) used the CFD model to invent a new AMS technology with improved performance for <100 nm particles; and 3) evaluated a newly developed instrument which combines a laser vaporization system with a standard AMS to provide size resolved mass and composition data for soot.  During xxxxxx we propose: 1) upgrade our CFD modeling capability to three-dimensions to evaluate xxxxxxian motion and the effects of fabrication imperfections; 2) fabricate and test the promising lens geometry invented during xxxxxx I; 3) demonstrate the laser vaporization AMS and improved lens design(s) in the laboratory and in the field.	16566

In this STTR we will develop an integrated metal hydride system and spectrally-tuned thermophotovoltaic power converter system that can extract heat during periods of high thermal intensity (tens of seconds), and convert it to electricity at greater than 25 percent efficiency. Following the end of this period, the system can continue to generate useful power for additional tens of minutes.In xxxxxx I, for the power converter system, we will demonstrate feasibility of fabricating a critical component in larger areas (5 cm x 5 cm), and for the metal hydride (MH) system, we will experimentally characterize the MH decomposition/recombination reactions that enable continual electrical power generation for a useful duration after the period of high thermal intensity has ended.  In xxxxxx, we will produce an engineering prototype of the integrated heat scavenging electrical power generator system, fully tested in laboratory environment and in simulated operational thermal environment, together with an analytical model of a functional system.	16567
Miniaturized High Performance Optical Gyroscope, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	We propose a new approach for to the design and fabrication of miniaturized Interferometric xxxxxx xxxxxxical xxxxxxcope (FOG) that enables the production of smaller IRU with enhanced performance. The size and performance limitations of the standard FOG are being reduced due to the utilization of highly integrated approach of all the gyro components. Specifically, the ASE light source and the receivers, splitters and TIA are all incorporated in a small, robust silicon/silica platform using hybrid integration. In addition, the sensor is using an innovative new coil design and high performance miniaturized IOC that results in tenfold reduction of the bias temperature sensitivity compared to the existing FOG products. The combination of these attributes supports a smaller, lower cost, high performance and robust IRU that can serve future xxxxxx mission needs.	16568

Robust Switching Control for Hypersonic Vehicles, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx in the hypersonic regime is critical to xxxxxx goals because access to earth orbit and re-entry from orbit to earth or to other planets with atmospheres require flight through this regime.  Hypersonic flight poses a wide array of difficulties, including significant guidance and control challenges.  For example, flexible airframes and highly integrated airframe and propulsion systems common in scramjet designs mean that aerodynamic and propulsion control are closely coupled.  Control laws for hypersonic vehicles must also handle a very broad range of dynamics as hypersonic vehicles often operate from subsonic through hypersonic speeds and possibly with multiple propulsion modes for different speed ranges.  xxxxxx saturation and significant models uncertainty also pose control challenges, and demanding energy management requirements make guidance and trajectory optimization challenging tasks as well.  The proposed research will develop innovative control strategies to address the challenges of hypersonic flight.  These will be based on recent advances in switching control methods that provide large stable regions and disturbance rejection guarantees in the presence of actuator saturation.  The proposed control methods will ultimately be integrated with advanced guidance approaches for hypersonic vehicles developed by Barron Associates.	16570
Integrated Sublimator Driven Coldplate for use in Active Thermal Control System, Phase II	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	"The original xxxxxxlimator Driven Coldplate (SDC) design sought to provide significant mass savings over a traditional pumped fluid loop by combining the functions of a cold plate and a sublimator and eliminating the fluid loop (xxxxxx, et. al., \"Design of a xxxxxxlimator Driven Coldplate xxxxxxment xxxxxx,\" 2008-01-2169). The target application was to provide heat rejection for the ascent module of the xxxxxx lunar lander vehicle during the lunar ascent mission phase. xxxxxxver, in order to provide heat rejection for the ascent module during the rest of the mission, it is desirable to keep the ascent module integrated with the fluid loop in the rest of the xxxxxx vehicle. Therefore, we propose an xxxxxxted xxxxxxlimator Driven Coldplate (ISDC) that can function as both a standard flow-through cold plate and a xxxxxxlimator Driven Coldplate. The ISDC builds on the original SDC concept by adding coolant layers so that it can be integrated with the pumped fluid loop on the rest of the vehicle. This approach provides mass savings by (1) combining multiple pieces of hardware into a single piece of hardware and (2) providing additional fault tolerance without the need for redundant hardware."	16571

The number and type of different propulsion elements required are significant, and predicting internal solid motor behavior and characteristics and assessing external environments due to plume impingement on vehicle structures is a top priority.  xxxxxx motors do not require pre-start thermal conditioning but can be throttled by grain shape and pintle design, and thus the analysis tools must be flexible and prepared to meet the appropriate simulation readiness level.  Our proposed innovation will enhance existing engineering software by combining new flow solution methodologies with appropriate boundary conditions to create a novel toolset for complex multi-phase solid rocket analyses.  The innovation will be based on the LOCI/CHEM multi-physics analysis package and will utilize new LOCI features, new multi-phase flow models, and theoretical and phenomenological boundary conditions to create a unique software tool for solid propellant burning, particle breakup, surface erosion, and environment characterization for next generation solid motors.

The unit takes advantage of recent advancements in computer technologies, and incorporates them for utilization throughout ground propulsion test facilities, eliminating the need for rebuilding existing systems. The unit is a practical field deployable tool that can be setup quickly throughout the facilities' hydrogen environments, and offers the capability for rapid deployment for instances when issues suddenly arise and facility xxxxxx Acquisition Control xxxxxxs (DACS) are not available. Additionally, the unit can independently operate equipment in the field for an extended duration (approximately 30 days).  The unit provides three major innovations: (1) the ability to effectively power, cool and purge electrical equipment in a self-contained intrinsically safe enclosure; (2) mobile equipment cooling capability for extended operational durations; and (3) employs a novel intrinsically safe instrumentation interconnection port.An independent equipment platform designed to support a wide variety of electrical equipment was encapsulated into a self-contained portable enclosure unit.  The unit was constructed for certified deployment within \"Class I, Division 2, Group B\" explosive environments).  The units employ a novel purging system with redundant tanks for ensuring external gases remain isolated from the unit's internal components.  The interior is continually monitored for a loss of positive purge pressure. Upon any loss of purge events, the system will immediately go into a safe state.   The units employ highly efficient coolers for actively removing interior heat through an external convection driven thermal heat exchanger.  The cooling system is highly effective for maintaining proper electronic operating temperatures while remaining safe for use within explosive environments.  A heavy duty but light weight case with roller and retractable handle features was modified to make portable air sealed enclosures for encapsulating the units.  The cases were equipped with external solar panel mounting rails, a viewing window, enhanced door seals, low pressure relief valves, and intrinsically safe wire ports which are custom made, and allow instrumentation, control, and network access interconnections to be hermetically sealed. The portable systems are easily setup for quick deployment for independent operation in hydrogen environments. The units may be left operational for up to thirty days with the existing battery. The system is automatically controlled by a custom built microprocessor control module.  The intelligent module links all the systems for performing real-time synchronized operations with a simple user interface panel.  The panel can be observed through a viewing window, and operated with magnetic scroll/enter switches.  The microprocessor module also provides basic operational event logging and basic cargo interface capabilities."	16578

Aging Methodologies and Prognostic Health Management for Electrolytic Capacitors	2013-05-09	2018-07-19	Understanding the ageing mechanisms of electronic components critical avionics systems such as the GPS and INAV are of critical importance. xxxxxxlytic capacitors and MOSFET’s have higher failure rates among the components of xxxxxx power converter systems. Our current work focuses on analyzing and modeling electrolytic capacitor degradation and its effects on the output of xxxxxx converter systems. The output degrada- tion is typically measured by an increase in ESR (Equivalent Series xxxxxx) and decrease in the capacitance value over long periods of use even under nominal operating conditions. Typically the primary effect of degradation is increased ripple current and this has adverse effects on downstream components. For example, in avionics systems where the power supply drives a GPS unit, ripple currents can cause glitches in the GPS position and velocity output, and this may cause errors in the Inertial Navigation (INAV) system, causing the aircraft to fly off course. In this paper, we present the details of our ageing methodology along with details of experiments and analysis of the results.	16586

Lunar Organic Waste Reformer, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx Organic xxxxxx Reformer (LOWR) utilizes high temperature steam reformation to convert all plastic, paper, and human waste materials into useful gases. In the LOWR, solar thermal concentrators are used to heat steam directly to 900 C, after which the steam is injected into a reactor which is being fed with waste materials via a lock hopper. At the high temperatures, the steam will react with all organic materials to produce a gas mixture largely composed of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, with small fractions of methane and CO. After removing the remaining steam from the product stream via condensation, the gases are dusulfurized and then fed through a polysulfone membrane which separates CO and xxxxxx in the retentate from xxxxxx and H2 in the permeate. The retentate CO/xxxxxx gas stream can be used to reduce regolith, while the Cxxxxxx permeate stream is sent to a Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) reactor which transforms the Cxxxxxx gas into CO and xxxxxx The CO can then be used for regolith reduction, while the xxxxxx can be used as is, or electrolyzed to make oxygen and hydrogen. With effective recycling of the steam, no consumables are lost in the process. All products are liquids or gases, making the system highly reliable and subject to automation. In the proposed xxxxxx program, Pioneer xxxxxxics will build on its extensive heritage with development of RWGS and regolith reduction systems developed for xxxxxx and xxxxxx in-situ propellant production to build and demonstrate a LOWR unit.	16588
Improved Attachment Design for Ceramic Turbine Blades Via Hybrid Concepts, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	"This proposal presents a hybrid metal-CMC turbine blade.  A xxxxxx/xxxxxx CMC airfoil section will be bonded to a single crystal superalloy root section in order to mitigate risks associated with an all-CMC blade inserted in a superalloy disk.   This allows current blade attachment technology (SX blade with a dovetail attachment to a slotted Ni disk) to be used with a ceramic airfoil.  The bond between the CMC and single crystal will be primarily mechanical in nature, and enhanced with clamping arising from thermal expansion mismatch.  Two single crystal root sections will be bonded to each other using diffusion bonding and/or transient liquid phase bonding at temperatures near 2200 0F.  The single crystals will form a clam shell around the CMC, with little or no gap between the metal and ceramic.  Upon cooling, the metal will shrink around the CMC spar to firmly clamp it. Single crystals will resist stress relaxation at an operating temperature of 1500 0F, thus maintaining clamping loads for long lives.  The use of an inter layer (\"compliant layer\") between the CMC and the single crystal may also be entertained.   1500 0F is a reasonable upper limit for chemical reactivity issues between the metal and ceramic."	16589

Robust, Self-Contained and Bio-Inspired Shear Sensor Array, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	The proposed innovation is a robust, bio-inspired, and self-contained sensor array for the measurement of shear stress.  The proposed system uses commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) components to create a distributed sensor array for the measurement of shear stress in either a flight or ground test environment.  The reusable sensor array requires no external wiring or power source.

Modular Magnetic Mobile Manipulators for Microgravity Environments	2015-10-01	2018-07-19	The proposed research utilizes novel omnidirectional electromagnets capable of on-line reconfiguration, called Omnimagnets, currently in development at the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx. An Omnimagnet is a cube with no moving parts, capable of real-time control of the magnitude and orientation of its magnetic field. If a magnetic tool is introduced in an Omnimagnet’s magnetic field, the Omnimagnet can dexterously manipulate the tool’s position and orientation. This method of manipulation is unlike any other telerobotic manipulation technique. In space, Omnimagnets will be able to manipulate each other and their separate magnetic tools, utilizing magnetic forces and torques that go beyond simple attraction and repulsion. By fixing to various spacecraft or satellite surfaces, Omnimagnets can walk across surfaces and magnetically carry tools large distances, using inchworm inspired approaches. Thus, Omnimagnets can deliver tools to the worksite and then manipulate those tools, potentially enabling safer and more cost-effective procedures. xxxxxx repair, debris removal from convoluted hard-to-reach structures, and assembly of structures in microgravity are some of the challenges that Omnimagnets and their tools will tackle in space. Like other manipulation systems operating in space (e.g., xxxxxx, SmartSPHERES), Omnimagnets will be able to relieve astronauts of both tedious routine maintenance tasks and highly dangerous extra-vehicular activity. xxxxxxic manipulation and inchworm locomotion in microgravity is a unique approach to coordinated motion that may contribute to other mobile manipulation projects. The design is also modular, allowing for Omnimagnets of various sizes and attachment mechanisms to work together to manipulate a diverse set of tools in a variety of environments. Furthermore, Omnimagnet manipulation will be safe for operation with and around humans, with no internally moving parts, low forces, and slow manipulation speeds. This project will involve: (1) the development of models and simulations of multiple Omnimagnets in a variety of manipulation scenarios; (2) the design and construction of a set of Omnimagnets, as well as a tool for the Omnimagnets to manipulate; (3) the development of a localization method for the Omnimagnets and their tools based on magnetic and range-finding techniques; (4) the construction of an aquarium to simulate microgravity, and attached air-filled containers to make the Omnimagnets and tool neutrally buoyant; (5) the experimental demonstration of manipulation techniques with the set of Omnimagnets and the tool using direct telemanipulation; and (6) the algorithm development and experimental demonstration of supervised autonomous control, in which the low-level Omnimagnet control is handled in software to achieve the human user’s desired high-level commands.	16605

Polarized Microwave Background Technologies for Inflationary Gravitational Wave Detection	2018-08-01	2018-07-19	"The detection of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) from the epoch of inflation is one of the next majors goals in cosmology. These PGWs leave a signature on the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) called the primordial \"B-modes.\" The quest for detection of this signature has launched substantial technological development because this signal is predicted to be one part in a billion of the unpolarized signal.The Cosmology Large xxxxxxular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) is a ground based telescope array which will measure the polarization of the CMB to unprecedented accuracy. This measurement will require the development of several technologies which will be required for the possible space mission outlined in the Epoch of Inflation xxxxxx push. CLASS will be an important test-bed for these technologies and will raise the technology readiness level of several relevant instruments.CLASS will use extremely sensitive antenna-coupled transition edge sensors and a rapid front-end polarization modulator to make a multifrequency measurement of the polarized CMB on the largest angular scales. By searching for the predicted peak in the primordial B-mode power spectrum, CLASS will detect the PGW signature if the tensor to scalar ratio is greater than 0.01.A detection of primordial gravitational waves from the epoch of inflation would have transformative effects on the field of cosmology.

Multiphysics Framework for Prediction of Dynamic Instability in Liquid Rocket Engines, Phase I	2018-06-01	2018-07-19	Mitigation of dynamic combustion instability is one of the most difficult engineering challenges facing xxxxxx and industry in the development of new continuous-flow combustion systems such as the combustion chambers in liquid-fueled rocket engines (LREs). Combustion instabilities are spontaneous, self-sustaining oscillations that tie the combustor acoustics to the combustion reaction itself. These oscillations can lead to a wide range of problems from off-design performance to catastrophic failure. Efforts to predict instabilities at design-time is hindered by the complex, multi-physics nature of the acoustics and chemistry, typically requiring multiple iterations of time and resource intensive system prototyping. The proposed xxxxxx I STTR project aims to develop a simulation framework that will enable accurate, design-time prediction of instabilities. This framework will leverage the capabilities of xxxxxx/CHEM for massively parallel, multi-physics flow simulations to generate low-order, independent models of combustion and acoustic response to perturbations. By solving for simultaneous solutions of these low-order perturbation models, it will be possible to numerically map the acoustic modes of the system to their stability characteristics, providing a means to predict instability. xxxxxx I will develop critical additions to xxxxxx/CHEM's combustion modeling capabilities, develop the appropriate acoustic models, develop a test plan for experimental validation of the combustion model, and conclude with a proof-of-concept demonstration of the full framework. In xxxxxx, an experimental campaign will be carried out to validate the combustion modeling tools developed in xxxxxx I and augment the simulation framework with multi-phase modeling appropriate for full-scale LRE combustion chambers.	16612

Aseptic Plant Culture System (APCS), Phase II	2007-04-01	2018-07-19	Aseptic plant culture plays a significant role in biotechnology and plant physiology research, and in vegetative propagation of many plant species. The development of an Aseptic xxxxxxt Culture xxxxxx would provide a mechanism for experimentation as well as for transporting and storing vegetatively propagated plant material in space. Most culture systems are passive, with no environmental monitoring or control.

The imaging grid would then couple light to a bank of amplified xxxxxxM pixels with integrated analog gain and data acquisition.  HyperV has already demonstrated as part of previous work a two clock domain technique for using slow cheap micro-controllers to manage high time resolution data acquisition over long record-length with a low cost digital backend.

Advanced 3D Object Identification System, Phase II	2009-01-01	2018-07-19	During the xxxxxx I effort, OPTRA developed object detection, tracking, and identification algorithms and successfully tested these algorithms on computer-generated objects of various shapes and sizes and on sample real-world image sequences of a xxxxxxII booster separation.  The algorithms currently identify six basic shapes (sphere, disk, cone, thin rectangle, tube, and cube) with better than 90% accuracy and estimate their size in three dimensions.  Object shape and three dimensional size information can be determine using images from a single digital camera while two cameras are needed to provide three-dimensional trajectory and ground impact position information.  While the xxxxxx I showed the feasibility of the approach, work still needs to be done during the xxxxxx effort refining and expanding the detection, tracking, and identification algorithms to take into account the effect of noise, obscuration (smoke, clouds, etc), and viewing angle.

Electronics Modernization	2012-09-01	2018-07-19	There is a need to reduce mass and volume on any spacecraft whether for earth orbit insertion or travel within the solar system. Less mass and a smaller volume can dramatically reduce the cost of the launch vehicle as well as the spacecraft. xxxxxxly, the problem of too much mass and volume can be a result of the spacecraft structure, propulsion system, instrument and its electronics. This xxxxxxhop will focus on mass and volume reduction of the electronics.Current electronic packaging designs used in our most recent spacecraft are comprised of technologies from the 1980's and 1990's. The current approach to electronic packaging design and selection uses well known design solutions because they are considered low risk and have space flight heritage; typically a ruggedized VME (Versatile Mechanical Euro) packaging architectures. Semiconductor features of this vintage utilize features that are measured in microns. As semiconductors have advanced, features are now measured in nanometers. We can use the example of the ixxxxxx; with our current electronics design approaches the ixxxxxx would be the size of a breadbox. These modern phones and devices such as laptop computers incorporate hundreds of new packaging technologies, some of which are appropriate for spaceflight and some that are not robust enough. The challenge is to identify the most useful technologies that are likely to survive rigorous spacecraft testing. With the exception of some earth-orbiting missions, virtually all other missions have unique environmental survival requirements. The primary objective of the xxxxxxhop will be to identify industry established state-of-the-art packaging technologies that can be leveraged without technology development with a focus on miniaturization. This will include active and passive components, substrates, connectors etc. Reliability and reworkability will be considered but will be a secondary objective in order to allow creativity. There will be a review of current JPL electronic packaging subsystems that can be exploited by reverse engineering the existing design. Also, new in-process JPL designs will be considered for redesign.	16634
Compact, Lightweight Isolation Platform (CLIP), Phase II	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx has a critical need for improved bi-directional data transmission rates from a variety of spacecraft to Earth.  xxxxxx estimates that the current xxxxxx to Earth transfer rate of 6 xxxxxx might be increased to 600xxxxxx using a xxxxxx Communication (LC) system.  Beam jitter caused by spacecraft-based motion must be reduced to sub-microradian levels to enable beaconless optical beam pointing.  ATA will create a Compact, xxxxxxweight Isolation xxxxxx (CLIP) that will host the LC collimator telescope and provide a stabilized platform to prevent the 150-microradian spacecraft disturbance environment from reaching the LC terminal.  To enable that stabilization, ATA will develop an ultra-low angular noise xxxxxx xxxxxxular Position xxxxxx (CAPS).  The proposed sensor will have low power and high reliability, which ATA will demonstrate by producing xxxxxx 4 prototypes in xxxxxx I and xxxxxx 5 CLIP engineering development unit (EDU) in xxxxxx.The integrated CLIP overall design is a major innovation.  Most significantly, the platform payload capacity must increase from the typical few hundred grams to as much as 50 kilograms, roughly two orders of magnitude, but without major growth in the mass of the platform itself.  While the payload for most stable platforms is only a small fraction of the platform overall mass, the CLIP payload must be from more than half (3 kg) to as much as 94 percent of the total platform mass (3-50 kg payload + 3 kg platform).  xxxxxxd with the large payload range, the needed disturbance rejection from 150-microradian to less than 0.5-microradian across the broad frequency range of 0.1 to 500 Hz requires innovation in the platform suspension, high-performance actuators, servo controls, and structure.  Other programs have demonstrated these requirements individually, but the innovation CLIP provides is to combine structure, suspension, actuators, and sensors to give the required performance within the stringent 3-kg weight and 15-W power constraints.	16635
Consistent Practices for Characterizing the Detection Limits of Fracture Critical Metallic Component Inspection Systems	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	xxxxxx-STD-5009 requires that successful flaw detection by NDE methods be statistically qualified for use on fracture critical metallic components using Probability of xxxxxxion (POD) studies, but does not standardize practices. This task works towards standardizing calculations and record retention with a web-based tool, the xxxxxx POD xxxxxx, or NPSL. Best practices for test methods and specimen storage will also be provided&nbsp;with appendices to xxxxxx-STD-5009, which is currently unded revision.&nbsp;Additionally, this appendix will describe how POD specimens used to qualify NDE systems will be cataloged, stored and protected from corrosion, damage, or loss. BackgroundFlaw detection capability&nbsp;is established for inspection systems on the basis of Probability of xxxxxxion (POD).&nbsp; The commonly accepted metric for an adequate inspection system is as follows:&nbsp;for a minimum flaw size which is smaller than the critical defect being sought,&nbsp;there is 90% probability of detection with 95% confidence (90/95 POD). &nbsp;Inspection systems that are incapable of meeting the 90/95 POD requirement at or below the critical defect level for fracture critical components are deemed&nbsp;unsuitable for that inspection. &nbsp;To provide an efficient and accurate methodology that yields estimates of POD and confidence bounds for&nbsp;Hit-Miss or signal amplitude testing the directed design of experiments for probability of detection (DOEPOD) method has been developed.&nbsp; In DOEPOD, signal amplitudes are reduced to Hit-Miss data by defining a signal threshold.&nbsp; The directed DOEPOD method uses&nbsp;a nonparametric approach for the analysis of inspection data which, unlike other methods,&nbsp;does not rely on simlifying assumptions regarding&nbsp;the&nbsp;general form of a POD function.&nbsp; This differs with other methods&nbsp;that define a POD&nbsp;curve based on a curve fit and does not assume increasing detection with increasing flaw sizes that can often be proven untrue.&nbsp; For a given sample set, the DOEPOD procedure identifies whether&nbsp;the minimum requirement of 90% probability of detection with 95% confidence is demonstrated for a minimum flaw size and for all greater flaw sizes (90/95 POD).&nbsp; These procedures are sequentially executed&nbsp;to minimize the number of samples needed to demonstrate that there is a 90/95 POD lower confidence bound at a given flaw size and that the POD is monotonic for flaw sizes exceeding that 90/95 POD flaw size.This work provides strong experimental and simulation evidence that&nbsp;a 90/95 POD flaw size will be identified by DOEPOD 95% of the time if it exists, and the procedures will yield a determination that the POD is non-monotonic 97% of the time when it is non-monotonic.&nbsp; xxxxxx on this evidence, the DOEPOD methodology may be used to reduce mission risk by quantifiably meeting the requirements of xxxxxx-STD-5009, &ldquo;Nondestructive Evaluation xxxxxx for Fracture Critical xxxxxx Components.&rdquo;&nbsp;xxxxxxA total of 860 metal specimens have been produced with a selection of fatigue cracks, fastener hole cracks, lack of weld fusion, and electrical discharge machined (EDM) flaws. &nbsp;The metals used in this study are common throughout aerospace, and include aluminum, titanium, nickel-chromium alloy, and stainless steel. &nbsp;Flat plates and tubes with programmed defects are being&nbsp;examined.&nbsp; These specimens are being examined&nbsp;with x-ray radiography with differing film densities, digital radiography, ultrasound (including phased array), eddy current (including automated methods), florescent penetrant testing (L3 &amp; L4), magnetic particle testing, and visual testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;xxxxxxersAll xxxxxx centers and missions utilizing failure critical components.&nbsp;ProductsThe data set generated by this study is vast.&nbsp; Specialized web-based software, termed the NNWG NDE xxxxxx (NPSL), is being developed to archive and analyze all data and results.&nbsp; While this web application is being developed and validated to provide analytical support for this study, it will also be expanded upon to provide a centralized and living NDE capability database.&nbsp; Further, it will also provide NDE experts with a standard&nbsp;POD analysis tool for future studies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lessons learned during&nbsp;this study will be published in guidance documents for designing&nbsp;statistically adequate POD tests, as new standards, or as appendices to xxxxxx-STD-5009.&nbsp;A comparison to other POD estimation methods will be made to identify validation gaps&nbsp;in methods used for failure critical inspections increasing overall&nbsp;mission success.&nbsp;&nbsp;(xxxxxx/TM&ndash;2014-218183).&nbsp;&nbsp;Project ManagerCharles Nicholsxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Test Facility(575) xxxx&nbsp;Technical Point of ContactEdward R. xxxxxxrazioxxxxxx xxxxxx(575) xxxx&nbsp;xxxxxx100 percent of the flawed samples have been manufactured and delivered for testing.Publication of DOEPOD methodology. 70% of the specimens have been tested.DOEPOD v.1.2 and manual available.Familiarization training on xxxxxx/GSFC file structure and DOEPOD complete.xxxxxxnic/hard copy data consolidatedNPSL software requirements agreed to including cataloging and searching capabilities.POD literature review and draft &lsquo;Best Practices&rsquo; completed.Review outsourced to POD experts (xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx) and NESC NDE TDT statused.&nbsp;	16636

Under our xxxxxx I program, xxxxxx successfully demonstrated the capability of a new laser source, a diode-pumped frequency-doubled Er:YAG laser to generate millijoule output near 823 nm that was tunable through water-vapor absorption lines for DIAL measurements. The new laser system offers simplicity and efficiency that will reduce risk for future airborne and space-based missions. Significantly, the new laser approach offers an upgrade path with reduction in size, weight, and power (SWaP) consumption over current state-of-the-art DIAL based on less-efficient non-linear parametric conversion of diode-pumped xxxxxxYAG lasers. This new-generation technology reduces the size and weight of flight hardware to make it compatible with affordable, more capable airborne and satellite payloads.

The framework will define what kinds of data and information are needed a priori in order to design the FDI system, what kinds of mission requirements can be answered with the system, and how the system should be implemented in order to meet those requirements. The framework will also include the procedure to facilitate the efficient integration of our FDI methodology into both existing and planned systems. Clearly defining the FDI design process through this framework will make the technology more accessible to mission designers and lower the cost of implementation, providing more opportunities to apply this technology.  The efficacy of the framework will be confirmed by designing and implementing collocated and non-collocated FDI systems for a representative satellite mission. The framework will also include introductory tutorial material designed for mission planners.	16641
New Analysis and Theory of Deployable Folded Structures, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	A recently developed mathematical theory has great value for deployable space structures and in situ manufacture of large beams, panels, cylinders and other components.  The new technology offers diverse capacity to design, manufacture, and self-assemble periodically folded sheet material.  The range of materials includes many customized core materials for laminated panels, cellular habitat wall constructions, structural beams, parabolic reflectors, and efficient truss systems that can be packaged ideally as a roll of sheet material and deployed in space by inflation or passive radiation.  The goal of this proposal is to launch the technology by demonstrating the diversity of folding architectures for deployable and in situ manufacture of space structures, and by developing the design and simulation software for distribution to the engineering community.To fully illustrate the scope of applying the design methodology for deployable space structures, inventories of the strategy for deployment, the desired laminate geometry, and the folding architectures will be made. By relating the dynamical constraints of these three inventories in a three-axis matrix and then optimizing the found solutions through the software, a diverse scope of deployable structures will be illustrated.  Moreover, proof of concept for a second generation of software operating through new algorithms will be  shown concurrently for space applications and others.	16642

On-Demand Urine Analyzer, Phase II	2006-12-01	2018-07-19	The overall goal of this program (through xxxxxx) is to develop an analyzer that can be integrated into xxxxxx (xxxxxx) toilets to measure key chemicals in urine.  The analyzer will employ a novel metal-doped sol-gel material to both separate these key chemicals from urine and provide surface-enhanced xxxxxx spectra to identify and quantify these chemicals.  The xxxxxx I program successfully demonstrated feasibility by chemically extracting 3-methyl histidine, a muscle-loss indicator, and raloxifene a bone-loss inhibitor from simulated urine.  In flowing experiments, both chemicals were measured at 10 nanogram/mL, below the required detection limit of 1000 ng/mL for 3-methyl histidine, and near the required detection limit of 1 ng/mL for raloxifene.  xxxxxx program will develop the method of analysis using some 50 bio-indicators, drugs and metabolites, and potential interfering urine components.  The program will also design and build an automated extraction, measurement and analysis system suitable for integration into xxxxxx proposed xxxxxx toilets.  xxxxxx has agreed to an on-site demonstration that includes initial measurements using the proposed analyzer and their equipment to initiate xxxxxx collaboration.	16644
Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth	2018-06-25	2018-07-19	xxxxxx nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed. This gazetteer contains detailed information about all names of topographic and albedo features on planets and satellites (and some planetary ring and ring-gap systems) that the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has named and approved from its founding in 1919 through the present time.	16645
