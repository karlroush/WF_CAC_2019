3D Flash LIDARAll Weathr Safety, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	ASC has developed non-scanning 3D xxxxxxTM imagers for UAS situational awareness and autonomous landing.  This sensing technology is the most advanced LIDAR technology available for UAV guidance and landing site determination.  ASC's array technology has allowed for compact LIDAR cameras that collect full frame 3D point clouds in a single FLASH (xxxxxx).  The 3D days will improve the mobility, efficiency and safety of air transportation systems.  ASC's xxxxxx is the LIDAR in xxxxxx and xxxxxx xxxxxx (ALHAT) for xxxxxx.

Collaborative Outbound Taxi Metering for Environmental Benefits, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	This proposal addresses the concept of Collaborative Outbound Taxi xxxxxxing (COTM), which provides environmental benefits without sacrificing throughput.  In current operations, departure flights must block out of their parking gates to claim their first-come, first-served departure slot.  When departure demand exceeds capacity, flights experience delay in departure queues near the runway.  The need for flights to make incremental steps in the queue significantly increases the engine emissions produced because of the number of times aircraft must apply 'break-away' power, only to stop again after moving just a short distance.  Under the COTM concept, metering techniques assign and maintain departure slots for all departure flights even if aircraft remain at their parking gates.  xxxxxx has conducted initial analysis using historical operational data demonstrating the potential environmental benefits even in the presence of arrival flights requiring parking gates.  This concept has already been applied and shown significant benefits during over-night operations of air cargo carriers.  Implementing the concept across the entire NAS has not been possible due to the requirement to coordinate departure metering amongst multiple airport users.  We propose to further demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the COTM concept at large hub airports.	12293
Method for Producing Launch/Landing Pads and Structures	2015-04-01	2018-07-19	Current plans for deep space exploration include building landing/launch pads capable of withstanding the rocket blast of much larger spacecraft that that of the xxxxxx days. The proposed concept will develop lightweight launch and landing pad materials from in-situ materials, utilizing regolith to produce controllable porous cast metallic foam bricks/tiles/shapes. These shapes can be utilized to lay a landing/launch platform, as a construction material or as more complex parts of mechanical assemblies. Currently there are no methods of constructing landing/launch pads in space on an extra-terrestrial surface for xxxxxx / xxxxxx xxxxxxding (VTVL). This means that there is a risk to the lander vehicle and crew due to rocket engine plume high pressure impingement on the regolith surface, which could cause erosion resulting in high velocity ejecta and a crater.&nbsp; The ability to robotically construct these pads out of in-situ materials will provide a method of mitigating the risk, decreasing the lifecycle cost and increasing the reliability of vertical take- off and vertical landing vehicles. Robotic precursor missions could use these methods to prepare a landing site by grading it and stabilizing the regolith surface with autonomously emplaced pavers made from in-situ regolith, which have structural integrity and thermal resistance sufficient to withstand the forces and very high temperatures from a chemical rocket engine plume. Ultimately this will increase the safety of the crew during space exploration arrivals and departures.The current plans for xxxxxx human exploration indicate that it will be necessary to build landing/launch pads capable of withstanding the rocket blast of much larger spacecraft than that of the xxxxxx days (20-40 metric tons landed mass). In addition, creating building materials from in-situ materials has been receiving increasing focus. To avoid having to land and launch a great distance from the focus area of exploration, methods to furnish a suitable landing area have focused on such techniques as sintering the regolith with a solar concentrator or microwave energy. The problem with these techniques is that they are very time consuming and dense materials are the result.	12294

A preliminary systems level concept has been developed. This concept will be refined during the proposed xxxxxx I investigation, including proof-of-concept breadboards and analyses of critical subsystems.	12296
Regenerable Sorbent for Combined CO2, Water, and Trace-Contaminant Capture in the Primary Life Support System (PLSS), Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx objective of expanding the human experience into the far reaches of space requires the development of regenerable life support systems.  This proposal addresses the development of an integrated air-revitalization system for the space suit used in xxxxxx Activities (EVAs).

The xxxxxx objectives are: (1) to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using a novel xxxxxx sorbent; and (2) to demonstrate effective xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and ammonia sorption and regeneration.  This will be accomplished in three tasks: (1) Sorbent Preparation and Characterization;  (2) Sorbent xxxxxx; and (3) Product Assessment.	12297
Quantum Calorimeters Based on HgCdTe Alloys, Phase II	2009-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx next generation of x-ray observation missions require x-ray calorimeters with superior energy resolution. xxxxxx has already proven itself as an excellent soft x-ray absorber material due to its low heat capacity. Hg0.834Cd0.166Te was shown in xxxxxx to have a heat capacity superior to that of HgTe. Hence Hg0.834Cd0.166Te-based microcalorimeter arrays are expected to have an energy resolution superior to that of HgTe-based ones. We propose the growth of single crystal Hg0.834Cd0.166Te layers by molecular beam epitaxy on Si substrates. Mercury vacancies will be filled after growth to reduce the possibility of them acting as acceptors and introducing a significant electronic heat capacity. The samples will be characterized by x-ray diffraction to assess their structural quality and crystallinity, FTIR mapping to confirm the uniformity of their energy gaps and alloy compositions, xxxxxx measurements to assess their electrical transport properties, etch pit density counts to determine dislocation densities, transmission electron microscopy to determine microscopic structural information, and heat capacity and thermalization efficiency measurements at mK temperatures. These assessments will further test their promise as high energy resolution quantum calorimeters and will help optimize material and processing parameters. The thermal property measurements will be performed on samples specially processed to remove some or all of the Si substrates and xxxxxx buffer layers. Finally, the development of a broadband infrared/mm wave reflective coating will be undertaken. The produced samples will be compatible with incorporation into microcalorimeter arrays for xxxxxx missions.	12298
Behavioral Monitoring and Evaluation for the Delivery of Interactive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (B-MEDIC), Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx behavioral health and performance are of high importance,especially for long duration exploration missions. xxxxxxy detection ofstress and effective options for restoration and enhancement ofbehavioral health are imperative for accomplishment of missionobjectives and for maintaining a productive spaceflight environment. Toaddress the behavioral health issues during exploration missions, thexxxxxx Behavioral Health and Performance Program Element (BHP) is lookingfor a non-invasive technology that would unobtrusively, and with minimalcrew time and effort: monitor physiological markers of stress; offercountermeasures for maintenance and restoration of behavioral health;and identify methods to prevent decrements in behavioral health.

Rapid Concentration for Improved Detection of Microbes in ISS Potable Water, Phase II	2018-04-01	2018-07-19	Providing a reliable supply of safe drinking water is a critical requirement for space exploration. xxxxxxs that provide recycled treated water aboard xxxxxx, and that will supply water aboard future spacecraft, are inherently complex and can be susceptible to biofilm formation and microbial contamination. Further, it has been noted that pathogenicity and virulence of microbes can increase in microgravity environments. These factors, along with the high consequence of sickness in the remote space environment, make rapid, reliable methods of detecting microbes at low levels a critical need. xxxxxx microbiological detection systems have taken dramatic steps forward in the last two decades and today detection of even a single organism is possible in less than one hour. Unfortunately, development of rapid detection methods has far outpaced development of sample concentration and preparation techniques, which are necessary to enable detection of low microbial concentrations in drinking water. Currently, without sample concentration, rapid detection techniques alone produce results that are hundreds to thousands of times less sensitive than the minimum desired detection limit for microbial water contaminants. xxxxxxovaPrep proposes development of a rapid microbial concentration system designed for use aboard xxxxxx. The system will concentrate microbes from up to 5 xxxxxxrs of potable water into volumes as small as 200 uL, providing concentration factors as high as 15,000X. It will be based on technologies developed and commercialized by xxxxxxovaPrep, but will contain innovations to allow for operation in microgravity. Large volumes of potable water are processed through a hollow fiber membrane filter concentration cell as microbes are captured within the lumen of the fibers. Following capture, the microbes are efficiently eluted using a novel xxxxxx process and then delivered to a rapid detection system for analysis.	12300
Prototype Sensor Development for Geostationary Trace gas and Aerosol Sensor Optimization (GEO-TASO) for the GEO-CAPE Mission	2014-04-01	2018-07-19	N/A	12301
Investigation of a Fiber Optic Strain Sensing (FOSS) Distributed Load Calibration Methodology	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	FOSS is a relatively newer technology that needs to be explored for application to load calibration and loads monitoring efforts. xxxxxx calibration opportunities are rare and typically expensive. MQ-9 wing testing in FLL provides a rare opportunity to advance the sate of the art in aircraft load calibrations. xxxxxxent a MQ-9 wing with FOSS and conventional strain gages to measure wing shear, bending moment, torque and section properties along the span. Perform a loads calibration of the wing to determine load equations for measuring wing shear, bending moment, torque, and section properties along the span. Demonstrate through test the viability of developing a more cost effective and faster method of doing wing loads calibration using FOSS technology by comparing a FOSS load calibration test to the traditional technique using conventional strain gages. Utilize existing partnership with KSC Launch Services Program (xxxxxx) to define technology infusion plan to effectively transition real-time flight loads monitoring techniques from aeronautics to space applications.	12302
High Frequency Reflective Mesh for Small Aperture Antennas, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	The proposed xxxxxx I program would develop and prototype a high frequency, high performance reflective mesh that is well suited to the emerging small aperture antenna designs.  The program will review heritage mesh architectures and trade them against new designs.  xxxxxx materials and manufacturing methods will be evaluated with the goal of making low-cost mesh for CubeSat missions.  The mesh samples will be tested to determine their mechanical stiffness properties.  RF test samples will be delivered to xxxxxx JPL.	12303
Carbon Nanotube Electron Sources for Air Purification, Phase II	2008-12-01	2018-07-19	The innovation proposed here focuses on cleansing air with high energy electrons.  Bombardment by electrons has proven to be effective in removing a wide spectrum of chemical and biological pollutants.  xxxxxxn beam systems have a significant advantage over conventional VOC and odor control technologies.  The process requires less energy than other purification methods, generates no additional xxxxxx, requires no additional reagents and does not produce any solid or hazardous waste. We propose to develop an e-beam source to meet the restrictive cost, weight and reliability requirements attendant to commercial passenger aircraft and manned space exploration.  The key to this transition is to replace the thermionic cathode electron emitter with a carbon nanotube (CNT) field emission cathode. During xxxxxx we completed a design of an e-beam system suitable for maintaining air purity for an enclosed four men space station.  The system is compact, light weight and will fit readily in line with an air conditioning duct.  In xxxxxx, we will detail the design, and build a prototype of the e-beam system. That e-beam source can also be use for decontaminating small widely distributed pollution sources, such as small paint shops, gas stations, and restaurants.	12304
Longwave Imaging for Astronomical Applications, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop a compact portable longwave camera forastronomical applications.  In xxxxxx, we will develop and deliver thefocal plane array (FPA) - a crucial camera component.  In xxxxxx 2, wewill integrate the FPA with electronics and optics into a compactpackage and deliver the resulting camera to xxxxxx for field testing.	12305
Photonic and Quantum Interactions of Atomic-Scale Junctions	2020-08-01	2018-07-19	In this proposal, the fundamental quantum and photonic interactions of bimetallic atomic-scale junctions (ASJs) will be explored, with three major space technology-related applications in focus: 1) chemical sensing, 2) smart/metamaterials, and 3) memristor-based computing. An ASJ is a type of quantum-point contact, created by electrochemically depositing silver between two nanoscale electrodes. This connection can be formed and destroyed by applying the appropriate voltage potential across the electrodes, and thus controlled to the point where the junction narrows to the width of a single atom. At this point, the junction can exhibit a phenomenon known as quantized conductance.  In this region, the junction is especially sensitive to disturbances in the surrounding environment. Previous research has demonstrated the potential of a single ASJ in sensing chemicals bound to the junction at this narrowest section; this proposal will extend on that work by examining parallel and serial arrays of ASJs for chemical sensing and memristive computing, as well as the interaction of the junctions in 3-dimensional configurations with light for metamaterials.The objectives of this project are to establish control over junction growth in massively parallel arrays both through direct electrical contact and with photo-induced charging, then utilize this control to examine the potential application of these junctions in the areas described above. xxxxxxctions will be created using electrochemical deposition between conductive electrodes, which may be lithographically-defined macroscale electrodes on a wafer, a conductive AFM tip, or nanoparticles stimulated with focused lasers.Achieving these objectives would be highly significant to both xxxxxx and the community at large. Due to the junctions' small space and weight, a massively parallel array of junctions would not take up more than a few square millimeters of area on a silicon wafer yet could perform a wide array of functions; thus, they are ideally suited to the tight weight and size requirements of terrestrially-launched space missions. The applications of ASJs in chemical sensing and memristor-based neural network applications could allow for new experiments and data analysis not possible with existing technology. In addition, the fundamental insights into quantum and photonic phenomena gained by devices that operate at room-temperature and under simple conditions would also greatly benefit the scientific community and science education.	12306
Proposal for a Concept Assessment of a Fission Fragment Rocket Engine (FFRE) Propelled Spacecraft	2012-09-01	2018-07-19	A new technology, the Fission Fragment xxxxxx Engine (FFRE), requires small amounts of readily available, energy dense, long lasting fuel, significant thrust at specific impulse of a million seconds, and increases safety by charging the reactor after arrival in LEO. If this study shows the FFRE potential, the return could be immense through savings in travel time, payload fraction, launch vehicle support and safety for deep space exploration.	12307
Atmosphere Resource Recovery & Environmental Monitoring for Long Duration Exploration Project	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	The AES Atmosphere xxxxxxource Recovery & Environmental xxxxxx (ARREM) for Long Duration Exploration Project project is maturing Atmosphere Revitalization xxxxxxs (ARS) and Environmental xxxxxx (EM) systems that will reduce risk, lower lifecycle cost, and validate operational process design and system architectural concepts for future human exploration missions. The project is maturing these technologies using the xxxxxx state-of-the-art hardware as a point of departure.   This project merged into the AES Life Support xxxxxxs Project in FY15.The project focuses on key physico-chemical process technologies for Atmosphere Revitalization xxxxxxs (ARS) that increase reliability, capability, and consumable mass recovery as well as reduce requirements for power, volume, heat rejection, and crew involvement. For xxxxxx (EM) systems effort, the project is developing and demonstrating onboard analysis capabilities that will replace the need to return air and water samples to earth for ground analysis. This effort is addressing these challenges by adopting a new architecture that is based on the modular integration of multiple sensing modalities, employing a hybrid combination of simple, rugged technologies and, where needed, highly capable complex approaches, to completely address monitoring needs of the future. It incorporates xxxxxxelectromechanical xxxxxxs (MEMS) technologies to enable significant miniaturization over current systems, and selects elements offering both low resources and high reliability operation for affordability. The project is developing, demonstrating and/or testing leading process technology candidates and system architectures that will meet or exceed current requirements and fill capability gaps or significantly improve the efficiency, safety, and reliability over the state-of-the-art (SOA). The project's main goal is to demonstrate test articles (at various technology readiness levels) in a ground test facility under relevant flight conditions.	12308
Trajectory Clustering and an Application to Airspace Monitoring	2011-02-07	2018-07-19	This paper presents a framework aimed at monitoringthe behavior of aircraft in a given airspace. Trajectoriesthat constitute typical operations are determined and learnedusing data driven methods. xxxxxx procedures are used by airtraffic controllers (ATC) to guide aircraft, ensure the safety of theairspace, and to maximize the runway occupancy. Even thoughstandard procedures are used by ATC, the control of the aircraftremains with the pilots, leading to a large variability in the flightpatterns observed. Two methods to identify typical operationsand their variability from recorded radar tracks are presented.This knowledge base is then used to monitor the conformanceof current operations against operations previously identified astypical. A tool called AirxxxxxxMiner is presented, aiming atmonitoring the instantaneous health of the airspace, in real time.The airspace is “healthy” when all aircraft are flying accordingto the typical operations. A measure of complexity is introduced,measuring the conformance of current flight to typical flightpatterns. When an aircraft does not conform, the complexityincreases as more attention from ATC is required to ensure asafe separation between aircraft.	12309
Schematic Window Methodology Project	2016-10-01	2018-07-19	"The aim of this IRAD is to produce a generic launch window analyzer (SWM) that allows for large-scale rapid analysis of a launch window and orbit design trade space.  This will be \"game-changing\", preventing missions that are in early definition studies, for instance in the Mission Design xxxxxx (MDL), or new business efforts, from going into blind alleys.  The domain of applicability will be those missions whose orbit is well-modeled as xxxxxx or perturbed xxxxxx and includes a vast majority of missions (science, exploration, defense, or commercial), including many involving the new class of low-thrust small satellite platforms.Using a set of accurate analytic Variation of xxxxxxs (VOP) equations for orbit propagation, and a method for defining and 'mixing-and-matching' various mission constraints, the tool will allow flight projects to e.g. quickly determine launch opportunities, and explore the effects on these of relaxing mission constraints. The basic concepts involve taking advantage of the geometric notion of an orbit, the definition of a 'perturbation', and idea of 'geometric proxies'. Let us take these concepts in turn to better describe what SWM does.  The notion of an orbit is predicated on the use of xxxxxx orbit elements to describe the trajectory of the spacecraft as if it were a 'bead on an elliptically-shaped wire'.  That is to say that the semi-major axis and eccentricity describe the shape and size of the wire; the inclination, right-ascension of ascending node, and argument of perigee describe the wire's spatial orientation; and the true anomaly describes where on the wire the bead can be found.  The concept of perturbation allows us to think about this elliptically-shaped wire as slowly changing its shape, size, and orientation as the spacecraft 'feels' a variety of environmental effects such as higher-order terms in the geopotential, luni-solar gravitational pull, solar radiation pressure, and atmospheric drag.  Note that the application of delta-Vs are accomplished by discontinuously changing the orbit using standard methods. These two concepts are traditional 'textbook' ideas.  The distinguishing trait of SWM is the marriage of these ideas with the notion of a geometric proxy.  To illustrate the idea of a geometric proxy, consider a typical space science mission that wants to place spacecract in situ in the Earth's geomagnetic tail.  The geomagnetic tail lies in or near the shadow of the Earth.  In SWM, the orbit is then mapped into a geometric coodainte frame which moves as the Earth moves about the xxxxxx such that one of its axes always lies along xxxxxx line and another of its axes lies along the ecliptic pole.  In this frame the xxxxxx elements are 'moving' such that the line-of-apsides advances like the hands of a clock.  The action of the perturbations serves to either enhance or retard this motion. Thus the orbit's motion can be mapped into this frame where the geomagnetic tail and the shadow cast by the Earth are essentially fixed.  The final step is then use the geometric properties of the orbit and the geometric properties of the geomagnetic tail and the shadow region to simply predict the how much time is spent in the tail compared with the time spent in shadow.  Using the geometric proxies, the mission desing space can be quickly explored and, with a few more steps to describe how this orbit is established from launch, a launch window can be generated.  "	12310
BHL Cryotank for Long Term Use, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	GTL has already made substantial progress in developing and validating the xxxxxxTM technology for application to cryotanks.  xxxxxxier coupon testing of the temperature-dependent material properties confirmed the potential of the xxxxxx technology to eliminate the microcracking issue.  This was followed by the fabrication and cryo-pressure cycle testing of small xxxxxx cylinders.  No laminate leaks or degradation were detected in a test with more than 40 cryo-pressure cycles.  While other efforts are exploring the reliability aspects of the xxxxxx technology at larger scales, the proposed effort will focus on evaluating the long-term cryogenic propellant storage capabilities of the xxxxxx technology.  Specifically, this effort will include initial tests to examine the implications of long-term oxygen exposure on the xxxxxx laminate as the first step towards validating the technology for long-term xxxxxx exploration and other missions.    The effort will also refine the xxxxxx laminate design to optimize it for long-term cryogenic propellant storage.  This will include an effort to increase the insulating capability of the structural laminate to minimize the need for secondary insulation.  A small xxxxxx cylinder shall be fabricated using these refinements as a proof-of-concept.	12311
Development of an Engine Air-Brake for Quiet Drag Applications, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	A novel quiet engine air-brake is proposed in response to xxxxxx solicitation for concepts for active and passive control of noise sources for conventional and advanced aircraft.  The air-brake concept is applicable to 1) next-generation, conventional tube and wing aircraft (current generation +1) and 2) advanced integrated airframe/propulsion system configurations (current generation +2), and could enable system level noise reductions of several decibels at the ground observer during approach by quietly generating drag equivalent to up to three turbofan-sized bluff bodies per powerplant.  Such drag generation could enable slower, steeper approach trajectories with reduced need for drag generators such as flaps, slats and undercarriage.  Proposed research tasks build upon a rigorous understanding developed by the investigating team on the aero-acoustics of drag generating, swirling exhaust flows.  The objectives are to 1) create an engine air-brake design specification to constrain the design and identify and address issues and challenges associated with implementation, 2) perform trade studies on two aircraft/powerplant combinations in current generation +1 and +2 configurations to identify the attributes of suitable devices installed on such aircraft and 3) develop a candidate design for model scale aerodynamic and aeroacoustic validation in an experimental facility.  The deliverable will be a written report presenting a conceptual design of a model-scale engine air-brake and proposed test plan for xxxxxx validation.	12312

Multipurpose Waste Disposal Bags for Heat Melt Compactor Application, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx crewed spacecraft utilize storage containers for food water, supplies, trash and treated wastes. The trash bags occupy considerable vehicle storage and handling is a challenge to crewmembers. In order to reduce volume of the trash, microbial growth control and water recovery from trash, xxxxxx has developed a heat melt compactor (HMC) device.  In the xxxxxx I project, a multipurpose trash bag that is compatible with HMC was demonstrated.  The trash bag allowed for the recovery of water from waste and encapsulation of the solid waste after water recovery. In addition, the processed waste was protected against microbial growth for storing during long-term flights. The multifunctional trash bag developed in this xxxxxx I project, benefits xxxxxx in volume reduction, water recovery, radiation shielding and mitigation of contamination release in space.	12314

A design developed and tested in the xxxxxx I work consisted of a reusable vacuum shell and disposable cartridges.  Cartridges were capable of retaining bodily fluid simulants including saline solution, yogurt, cottage cheese, and a bovine blood/saline mixture with no release of fluids to the environment or vacuum system.  The cartridge design has been advanced to include cartridges capable of retaining fluid mixtures with high solids content and direct collection of vomitus from affected individuals.  xxxxxx effort will build upon the highly successful feasibility demonstration resulting in the development of a prototype MCMSD consisting of a rigid vacuum shell and collapsible/disposable cartridges capable of gravity independent collection and retention of up to 1.3 liters of biological fluids/solids.	12315

Dual Polarization Multi-Frequency Antenna Array, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxovative approaches for broadband multi-function antennas that conserve vehicle weight and reduce drag are welcome solutions for all airborne platforms including suborbital vehicles, where less total weight translates to longer mission times, less expensive payloads, and more acrobatic flight control. The xxxxxx xxxxxxearch team proposes an innovative approach to accomplishing the program objectives by employing advances in fragmented aperture antenna designs, and Meta-Materials research, in concert with the extensive xxxxxx xxxxxxearch capability in designing broadband antennas, to develop a low weight, low profile antenna system capable of operation over the electromagnetic region from 10 to 40 GHz. Designs will be addressed for antenna elements that can accommodate either broadband or multiband operation with polarization diversity. The primary technical objectives of the proposed program are to apply the advances in fragmented aperture arrays toward the goal of achieving an innovative broadband reconfigurable array. Extensive research conducted by xxxxxx xxxxxxearch in the area of fragmented aperture topologies have shown that this technology is ideally suited for applications requiring extremely broad bandwidths (in a reduced footprint) coupled with the capability for rapid reconfigurability of the antenna aperture. Such reconfiguration can accommodate efficient beam scanning, beam forming, and rapid polarization diversity (switching between various polarization modes). A key area of investigation will be into the application of fragmented aperture arrays, meta-materials, and continuously-variable distributed-circuit phase shifters using thin-film ferroelectric technologies.	12319

The Application of 3D Additive Machining to Enhance the Affordability of a Small Launcher Booster Stage, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The technical innovation proposed here expands upon early research into the viability of additive machining (AM) for liquid rocket engine components and other emerging capabilities to initiate xxxxxx 6 flight test evaluations of candidate applications that could enhance the affordability of a small launch vehicle (SLV) booster stage.  xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx, xxxxxx (USCD) has achieved success in applying  3D AM to fabricate a 200 lbf-thrust LOX/kerosene engine.  Concurrently, the Garvey xxxxxx Corporation (GSC) team continues to make progress in the development and flight testing of key elements for a future low-cost nanosat launch vehicle (NLV).  These xxxxxx-sponsored NLV designs, concept of operations (CONOPS) and cost metrics based on actual flight operations now serve as references for evaluating emerging technologies like UCSD's AM engine(s) to implement an SLV first  stage that achieves the aggressive cost, performance and sizing goals specified in the T1.02  subtopic description.  This is exactly the same approach that was followed under a previous xxxxxx STTR that successfully demonstrated a xxxxxx 6 for an advanced CMC-lined ablative engine chamber.  xxxxxx I flight testing features a subscale host vehicle, while xxxxxx then follows with an SLV-scale prototype booster.	12321
High Power Ga2O3-based Schottky Diode, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx Program will develop a new generation of radiation hard high-power high-voltage Ga2O3-based xxxxxx diode, which is suitable for applications in the space environment. Wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors have the potential to yield much more efficient power electronics than silicon, because their larger bandgaps allow them to withstand higher electric fields with less material, which also leads to lower system size and weight. While xxxxxx and xxxxxx are the two most technologically advanced WBG semiconductors, Ga2O3 is very promising and a new alternative. It has a larger bandgap (~4.8 eV) than either xxxxxx (3.3 eV) and xxxxxx (3.4 eV). Its large bandgap allows it to handle large electric fields, which in turn gives it a 4-10 times larger figure-of-merit than xxxxxx and xxxxxx for power devices. Ga2O3 has already been demonstrated in a variety of discrete electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as metal-semiconductor and metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, and UV sensors. Despite its potential, few companies have explored the Ga2O3 for power electronics in the Uxxxxxx xxxxxx diode proposed will be used as a rectifier in the power applications because of its low forward voltage drop leading to lower levels of power loss compared to ordinary PN junction diodes. The xxxxxx diode performance can far exceed that of other diodes in many areas due to its low turn on voltage, low junction capacitance and fast recovery time. The xxxxxx I project will also include modeling of material and device design, and production costs to xxxxxx for commercial implementation. During xxxxxx, we will build complete high power Ga2O3-based xxxxxx diode prototypes and test them under heavy ion and total dose radiation. We will demonstrate scale-up of the processing technology to the high power Ga2O3-based xxxxxx diode. We will also define the pathway to xxxxxx high volume production.	12322
Lunar Soil Particle Separator, Phase II	2012-01-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx xxxxxx Separator (xxxxxxS) is an innovative method to beneficiate soil prior to in-situ resource utilization (ISRU). The xxxxxxS can improve ISRU oxygen yield by boosting the concentration of ilmenite or other iron-oxide bearing materials found in lunar soils. This can substantially reduce hydrogen reduction reactor size and drastically decrease the power input required for soil heating. xxxxxxS particle size separations can be performed to de-dust regolith and to improve ISRU reactor flow dynamics. xxxxxxS mineral separations can be used to alter the sintering characteristics of lunar soil. The xxxxxxS can also be used to separate and concentrate lunar minerals useful for manufacture of structural materials, glass, and chemicals. The xxxxxxS integrates an initial centrifugal particle size separation with magnetic, gravity, and electrostatic separations. The xxxxxxS centrifugal separation method overcomes the reduced efficiency of conventional particle sieving in reduced gravity. The xxxxxxS hardware design integrates many individual unit operations to reduce system mass and power requirements. The xxxxxxS is applicable to ISRU feed processing as well as robotic prospecting to characterize soils over wide regions on the xxxxxx. The xxxxxxS is scalable and is amenable to testing and development in vacuum and reduced gravity.	12323

Novel Catalytic Reactor for CO2 Reduction via Sabatier Process, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Precision Combustion, xxxxxx. (PCI) proposes to develop a novel, efficient, and lightweight catalytic xxxxxx xxxxxx methanation unit, capable of converting a mixture of xxxxxx and H2 to methane and water with targeted xxxxxx conversions of &#8805;90% at high throughputs and at low operating temperatures (&#8804;350oC). In the spacecraft cabin air revitalization system (ARS), the utilization of xxxxxx to produce life support consumables, such as O2 and xxxxxx, via xxxxxx process as part of the xxxxxx Reduction Assembly (CRA) is an important aspect for long-term manned space explorations. The maturation of this technology will significantly reduce the need of re-supply from Earth. xxxxxx reaction is highly exothermic and is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium; therefore, the ability to control and maintain axial reactor temperature and catalyst surface temperature is crucial for obtaining good reactor performance and preventing catalyst deactivation. The proposed program will build on the short contact time kinetic benefits of xxxxxxREG technology (patented and trademarked by PCI) and PCI's proven catalyst coating development process from prior xxxxxx programs, to demonstrate a proof-of-concept toward delivering a modular, compact, and durable xxxxxx xxxxxx reduction prototype to xxxxxx.	12326
Mini Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (miniTOCA)	2013-09-01	2018-07-19	"The objective of this development is to create a prototype hand-held, 1 to 2 liter size battery-powered Total Organic xxxxxx Analyzer (TOCA).  The majority of missions beyond LEO require that all waste water sources on spacecraft be recycled into drinking water and verified clean to protect crew health.  Total Organic xxxxxx (TOC) is the sum of the carbon content of all organic contaminants in the water, and measuring TOC is a key method to monitor over all water quality, and is useful for tracking water processor system performance.  If the TOC in the recycled water is kept low (Total Organic xxxxxx (TOC) analyzers function by converting (oxidizing) all organic compounds (contaminants) in the water sample to carbon dioxide gas (xxxxxx), then separating and measuring the xxxxxx produced.  The data output is TOC concentration in ppm.  Total Inorganic xxxxxx (TIC) can also be measured in the same analysis.  Conventional TOC analyzers use at least 2 externally supplied \"reagents,\" a liquid buffer/oxidizer and a sweep gas to move the product xxxxxx to the detector.  We intend to eliminate all externally supplied consumables in this project. The MiniTOCA will use a preloaded long-life buffer, extremely small sample volumes (minimizes waste stored internally), and either purified ambient air as sweep gas or generate gas internally by electrolysis.  The MiniTOCA subsystems are developed and tested separately, then integrated.  Conventional plumbing and complex connections diminish in number dramatically by integrating the subsystems in creative ways.  This 2nd year effort focuses on the reactor and quantitative water sample injector plus integration, software and preliminary packaging.  Breadboarding to date indicates all the components will fit into a 1liter cube, excluding batteries.  The prototype system will be tested and debugged in the JSC Water & Food xxxxxx using challenge solutions prepared in the xxxxxx.  The 3rd year of funding will focus on eliminating any gravity dependencies, refining operational aspects, packaging and designs for a flight technology demonstration."	12327
Chip-scale Integrated Silica Ring Optical Gyro, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The next generation of space systems can benefit greatly by reduced c-SWaP integrated gyroscopes. By using photonic integration, it is possible to fit the entire gyro onto a single chip and inside a package <10 cm3, weighing < 50 g, and consuming <1 W of power. Furthermore, the fabrication of such chip-scale solutions reduces the cost per unit dramatically as ~thousands of optical gyroscopes can be made on each wafer and assembled using mature high-throughput semiconductor technology.  Freedom Photonics has developed advanced photonic integrated circuit (PIC) and planar lightwave circuit (PLC) capabilities to realize this device.  By leveraging our technology, we can delivery <0.05 deg/hr sensitivity optical gyroscopes with 10x lower weight, volume, and cost. These gyroscopes will have few components, require minimal assemble, and have no moving parts. The highly integrated devices are more resilient to shock and vibration, and can have longer gyroscope lifetimes with fewer component failures.       In xxxxxx I of this program, Freedom Photonics will determine the feasibility of meeting space-grade gyroscope specifications with a low c-SWaP solution leveraging our proprietary, commercially deployed photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology. A hardware benchtop demonstration will be included.	12328
High Interactivity Visualization Software for Large Computational Data Sets, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop a collection of computer tools and libraries called xxxxxxViz that enable researchers to visualize large scale data sets on xxxxxx resources remotely from their workstations at interactive rates.  The proposed technology will interoperate with common existing scientific visualization software and provide equivalent core functionality optimized for very large data sets. Existing scientific visualization tools have specific limitations for large scale scientific data sets.  Of these four limitations can be seen as paramount: (a) Memory Management, (b) xxxxxx xxxxxxization, (c) Interactivity, and (d) Specificity.  xxxxxxViz overcomes these four issues and uses stack oriented approach in order to produce tools that can be more easily and widely adopted with minimal interruption within existing visualization environments. xxxxxxViz  will be an open source implementation.	12329

Ceramic Matrix Composite Environmental Barrier Coating Durability Model, Phase I	2016-06-01	2018-07-19	As the power density of advanced engines increases, the need for new materials that are capable of higher operating temperatures, such as ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), is critical for turbine hot-section static and rotating components. Such advanced materials have demonstrated the promise to significantly increase the engine temperature capability relative to conventional super alloy metallic blades. They also show the potential to enable longer life, reduced emissions, growth margin, reduced weight and increased performance relative to super alloy blade materials. MR&D is proposing to perform a combined analytical and experimental program to develop a durability model for CMC Environmental Barrier Coatings (EBC). EBCs are required for CMCs in turbine exhaust environments because of the presence of high temperature water. The EBC protects the CMC and significantly slows recession. xxxxxxver, the durability of these materials is not well understood making life prediction very challenging. This program will be the first step in developing a tool to accurately evaluate the life of the EBC for a CMC turbine blade helping to facilitate their inclusion in future engine designs. This will be done by developing a custom, user defined element formulation for finite element modeling to simulate the kinetic reactions of the EBC with the turbine exhaust. It will be built on the back of earlier work developing such an element to model the oxidation of carbon fiber in reentry environments.	12331

Stable and Efficient Gaussian Process Calculations	2010-09-22	2018-07-19	The use of xxxxxx processes can be an effective approach to prediction in a supervised learning environment. For large data sets, the standard xxxxxx process approach requires solving very large systems of linear equations and approximations are required for the calculations to be practical. We will focus on the subset of regressors approximation technique. We will demonstrate that there can be numerical instabilities in a well known implementation of the technique. We discuss alternate implementations that have better numerical stability properties and can lead to better predictions. Our results will be illustrated by looking at an application involving prediction of galaxy redshift  from broadband spectrum data.	12335
Lightweight Ultrahigh Temperature CMC-Lined C/C Combustion Chambers, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx and DoD are seeking economical and high-performance bipropellant thrusters for various applications. These goals cannot be achieved using the silicided C103 chambers in current use. xxxxxx has developed and successfully demonstrated carbon fiber-reinforced zirconium carbide (C/xxxxxx) and carbon fiber-reinforced zirconium-silicon carbide (C/xxxxxx) ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) for use in liquid propellant applications up to 4200oF. xxxxxxhough the density of these CMCs is less than that of C103, further reducing overall weight is desired with a target goal of 2.6 g/cm3. xxxxxxxxcarbon (C/C) is widely used because of its light weight and high specific strength at elevated temperatures. xxxxxxver, adequate long-term protection of C/C is the limiting factor for its use in liquid propellant propulsion components. xxxxxx will combine the light weight of C/C and the ultrahigh temperature oxidation resistance of C/xxxxxx CMCs in a unique laminate composite. This system will possess an overall density that is similar to C/xxxxxx while increasing the operating temperature to 4000oF in liquid propulsion applications. Net-shape fabrication of CMC-lined C/C combustion chambers will be accomplished by adapting an innovative variant of xxxxxx's melt infiltration technology.	12336
High Precision RF Ranging and Range Rate Measurements over Laser Communication in Cubesat Platform	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	We propose to experimentally demonstrate high precision ranging (&lt;1 um) and range rate (&lt;1um/s) measurements using RF modulation on a optical carrier that is conducive to use on a laser communication channel. This is a continuation and further improvement of last year&rsquo;s CIF/IRAD &ldquo;Miniature xxxxxx Communication with xxxxxx, xxxxxx rate capabilities&rdquo; which has achieved 20 micron ranging and 10 micron/s range-rate accuracy. This IRAD will focus on the following methods to achieve higher measurement accuracies:1. Improve the instrument signal noise ratio by adopting: an ultra-low phase noise clock source; low noise active components, and applying different modulation formats on optical carrier. 2. Improve test equipment sensitivity: by developing a xxxxxx Mixer Time Difference (DMTD) time/frequency test apparatus, and developing a clock cleanup phase-locked-loop (PLL) with an ultra-low phase-noise Oven-Controlled-Crystal-Oscillator (OCXO).The realization of sub-micron ranging and range rate capability in a small-sat platform will: xxxxxxance the state-of-the-art for optical communication systems by including the accurate optimetric observations; xxxxxx precision formation flying missions that include virtual sensors, sensor webs, large-number-multi-spacecraft distributed mission, autonomous rendezvous &amp; docking; serve as an enabler for gravitational-based small-sat scientific missions; and provide the essential building blocks for &ldquo;Strategy and Implementation Distributed xxxxxx xxxxxx (xxxxxx)&rdquo;xxxxxx and range rate measurements can be derived from an optical communication data link clock signal. In any synchronized communication system, data is always synchronized to a clock signal. The comparison of receiver and transmitter clocks provides the accurate ranging and range rate measurements. This system can be configured in either a &ldquo;one way&rdquo; or &ldquo;two way&rdquo; mode.In a the two-way mode, the clock is looped back at the spacecraft and the measurement is done on the ground station by comparing the received signal to a high precision transmit clock. This provides very high accurate measurements since the frequency measurement is conducted against its-own source.In the &ldquo;one way&rdquo; mode, both transmit and receive spacecraft have their own precision on-board clock sources. The received clocks are measured against the on-board high-precision clock. The resulting frequency measurement provides two outputs: the transmit and receive clock source frequency difference, and the xxxxxx shift due to the spacecraft movement. They can be expressed as:xxxxxx frequency measurement: &delta;fspace = fspace - (fground+&delta;fdoppler)xxxxxx frequency measurement: &delta;fground = fground - (fspace+&delta;fdoppler)The xxxxxx frequency and ground-space clock offset can be calculated as:The sum of these two frequencies gives xxxxxx shift&delta;fspace + &delta;fground = -2&delta;fxxxxxxThe Difference of these two frequencies gives ground and space oscillator frequency offset&delta;fspace - &delta;fground = -2(fspace - fground )The frequency offset measurement from &ldquo;one-way&rdquo; configuration is extremely useful for deep-space missions to calibrate the on-board clock source.The work for this year will focus on improving accuracy to less than 1 micron/s and 1 micron distance. The prototype instrument will be compatible with a xxxxxx form factor.	12337

The data set encompasses all waveform observations obtained in the cruise mission phases before, between, and after the xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and xxxxxx encounter phases as well as those obtained during the four encounter phases. xxxxxx for this data set are acquired from the PWS waveform receiver. xxxxxx are presented as time series of 4-bit voltage measurements acquired at the rate of 28,800 samples per second through a 40 Hz to 12 kHz bandpass filter. An automatic gain control is used to keep the signal within the usable range of the 4-bit digitization, however, the gain information is not returned to the ground, hence, there is no direct, absolute calibration. xxxxxxver, a power spectrum analysis returns a spectrum that has accurate relative amplitudes between spectral elements. This data set provides the highest temporal resolution data from the Voyager mission. A browse data set is included with these data which provides for a graphical search of the data using a series of thumbnail and full-sized spectrograms which lead the user to the particular data file(s) of interest.	12346
Novel Solar Cell Nanotechnology for Improved Efficiency and Radiation Hardness, Phase II	2008-12-01	2018-07-19	"Significant improvements in photovoltaic materials and systems are required to enable xxxxxx future exploration missions. In this project, CFD xxxxxxearch Corporation (CFDRC) with xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx Riverside (UCR), Rochester Institute of xxxxxx, and International Photonics  will: 1) develop and provide reliable, validated computational tools for assessment, design, and optimization of novel nanostructures based on xxxxxx (QD) for future nano-devices for space applications; 2) investigate, design, and demonstrate new photovoltaic (PV) structures based on QD nanotechnology, with improved efficiency and radiation hardness. The inherently radiation tolerant quantum dots of variable sizes maximize absorption of different light wavelengths (\"multicolor\" cell), which dramatically improves photovoltaic efficiency and diminishes the radiation-induced degradation. xxxxxx included development of numerical tools for modeling electron-phonon transport in quantum-dot for photovoltaic applications, using experimental data from UCR xxxxxx-Device xxxxxx for validation and calibration of the models, computational and experimental proof-of-concept.  In xxxxxx 2, the new QD models will be integrated into CFDRC's advanced photonic-electronic device simulator and used for further optimization of QD superlattices.

They will be fabricated and demonstrated by detailed electrical characterization and radiation testing."	12347
Next Generation Life Support (NGLS): Variable Oxygen Regulator	2015-04-01	2018-07-19	The objective of the Variable xxxxxx Regulator Element is to develop an oxygen-rated, contaminant-tolerant oxygen regulator to control suit pressure with a significantly increased number of pressure set points as compared to the state-of-the-art.The Variable xxxxxx Regulator (VOR) is an oxygen-rated, contaminant-tolerant oxygen regulator for space suit pressure control, with a significantly increased number of pressure set points and range as compared to the state-of-the-art. The current EMU only has two settings that are mechanically controlled through an intricate mechanical linkage. The VOR is a dual-stage regulator in which the second stage uses a stepper motor to control the amount of compression on a spring that is balanced against gas pressure and then controls the size of the orifice that feeds gas into the suit.  Using a motor-driven actuator, it allows for continuous control of suit pressure over the range of 0-8.4 psid, compared to the 2 setpoints (~0.9 &amp; 4.3) of the state-of-the-art. The enhanced performance will facilitate and improve EVA operations and prebreathe protocols, allow regulation of suit pressure to match different vehicle pressures including integration with suit ports, allow for in-suit decompression sickness treatment, minimize or eliminate prebreathe durations prior to an EVA, and provide the flexibility to run variable pressure profiles during an EVA.xxxxxx of first (1.0), second (2.0) and third (3.0) generation variable oxygen regulator hardware:VOR 1.0xxxxxx BodyBench-top prototypeRated for nitrogen or airCOTS componentsxxxxxxxxambientxxxxxx 4VOR 2.0Monel Bodyxxxxxx packaging, sizeRated for 100% oxygenContaminant tolerantxxxxxx ComponentsRelevant EnvironmentxxxxxxVOR 3.0Monel, improved designxxxxxx-like unitRated for 100% oxygenContamination tolerantxxxxxx qualifiable componentsController w/interlocksRelevant Environmentxxxxxx 6	12348
Hydrogen Recovery by ECR Plasma Pyrolysis of Methane, Phase II	2008-11-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxment of a microgravity and hypogravity compatible microwave plasma methane pyrolysis reactor is proposed to recover hydrogen which is lost as methane in the conversion of carbon dioxide to water via the xxxxxx process.  This will close the hydrogen loop which currently requires 50% resupply. Efficient production of hydrogen from methane was conclusively demonstrated during xxxxxx I using microwave plasmas with power levels ranging between 50 - 120 W.  In the plasma reactor, formation and deposition of solid phase elemental carbon was shown to be far less problematic than for current methods of catalytic methane decomposition in fixed bed and fluidized bed reactors.  This new technology has strong potential for continuous hydrogen production over extended time periods, with minimal maintenance and operator intervention.  xxxxxx plasmas produce extremely high temperatures localized within very small volumes, resulting in low overall power requirements. xxxxxx plasmas also produce minimal thermal effects on downstream piping and other system components. These features provide the basis for a small, light, and low power method for hydrogen reclamation. By recovering all of the hydrogen which is lost as methane in the xxxxxx reactor, the requirement for production or resupply of hydrogen is reduced to the absolute minimum.	12349
Process and Tool Innovation for CAD Integration with OLTARIS, Phase II	2019-06-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx uses computer aided design (CAD) capabilities to produce space vehicle designs. One aspect of the vehicle design is utilizing enough shielding to minimize dose on personnel. xxxxxx CAD models inherit errors and issues during their inception that prevent them from being used with xxxxxx?s radiation transport code, High Z and Energy Transport (HZETRN). XL xxxxxxentific developed a ray tracing tool to generate inputs for HZETRN, called the CAD Radiation xxxxxxtion Tool (CRIT). This tool maintains material density and type, unlike any other existing capability. XL xxxxxxentific also developed methods of identifying and correcting common CAD errors. In phase II, XL xxxxxxentific will expand both CRIT and the CAD repair tools developed in xxxxxx Functions will be added to CRIT to read STEP and DICOM file types. We will add interfaces for both xxxxxx as well as industry standard radiation transport code, xxxxxx N-xxxxxx (MCNP). MCNP is widely used in the nuclear community for radiation transport calculations and adding it to CRIT will expand commercialization options to the nuclear and healthcare industry. We will also automate the CAD repair tools developed in xxxxxx Automation will allow users to correct common errors quickly and reduce the overall time spent repairing models. Furthermore, XL xxxxxxentific will add a sensitivity analysis option to investigate what effect model simplification has on radiation transport results. At the end of the xxxxxx effort, XL xxxxxxentific will have a tool to diagnose and repair CAD model quickly and provide robust radiation transport calculations. This innovation is anticipated to be of interest to government and commercial entities.	12350

Dust-Tolerant Reusable Connection Mechanisms for Lunar Environments, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	Dust, especially lunar dust, has been identified as a significant and present challenge in future exploration missions. In addition to posing contamination and health risks for human explorers, the interlocking, angular nature of lunar dust and its broad grain size distribution make it particularly detrimental to mechanisms with which it may come into contact. All xxxxxx lunar missions experienced some degree of equipment failure due to dust, and it appears that dust accumulation on exposed material is unavoidable and difficult to reverse. xxxxxxver, experience also indicates that material selection, location, and crew action can mitigate the detrimental effects of dust. It remains the case that significant development is called for in the area of devices and structures that tolerate or mitigate the presence of lunar dust. Thus, xxxxxx proposes to develop both active and passive methods for tolerating and mitigating dust accumulation on reusable connection mechanism interfaces. xxxxxx such as baffles, brushes, and fluid-washing will be explored more thoroughly as they relate to mechanical connections. Dust-tolerant connection strategies will be an enabling step for much of the technology that xxxxxx is currently developing for lunar drilling and sample and instrument manipulation in particular, and as a necessary precursor to interfaces for transferring electricity, fluids, and other utilities in general.	12355
An Electrochemical, Point-of-Care Detector for Reagent-free, In-situ Diagnostics of Pathogens, Phase I	2013-02-01	2018-07-19	For long-term exploratory space travel, there will be a critical need for in-situ diagnosis and assessment of biological specimens from symptomatic astronauts, especially, disease pathogens (virus, bacterium, or fungus) and microbial contaminants. Hence, a real-time, non-culture-based microbial detection, identification and quantification system for on-flight monitoring and evaluation of pathogens from astronauts, or the space environment, is strongly desired. The success of such diagnostic tasks critically depends upon the degree of automation and reliability of such trace level detection. To meet this need, we propose to develop a novel miniaturized, point-of-care (POC) detector for reagent-free, no-culturing, in-situ diagnostics of disease pathogens. The envisioned device will be compact, lightweight, fully integrated and automated (requiring minimum human intervention), and highly cost-effective and power-efficient. In xxxxxx I, we will develop a new type of electrochemical molecules and fabricate solid electrode-based probe for in-vitro demonstration of accurate and effective signal transduction of selective binding of pathogenic cells to the electrode as proof-of-principle. In xxxxxx, the electrode probe will be optimized to increase specificity, sensitivity, stability, and the response to regular biological samples. Finally, the sensor will be integrated with a compact handheld instrument for data collection, analysis and processing and interfacing with existing xxxxxx space instrumentation for both terrestrial and microgravity environments evaluation.	12356

Prototypical 32 x 32 APD arrays currently in production at xxxxxx Vision xxxxxxs (RVS) will be commissioned and characterized at the Institute for xxxxxx (IfA) in xxxxxx, xxxxxx. Commissioning will require developing and adapting an interface for detector operation, and characterizing will be accomplished in existing cryogenic platforms. The arrays will also be given trial runs using the astronomical facilities on xxxxxx, including the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx 2.2m telescope and the xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxx xxxxxx. Following validation of the prototype arrays, the RVS -IfA collaboration will upscale production to large-format megapixel APD arrays, design and implement long-term control and operation schemes, and begin incorporation of the arrays into upcoming instrument designs. The avalanche signal amplification of these xxxxxx APD arrays produces effectively noiseless signals useful for astronomical observations, and will likely see deployment in both ground- and space-based telescopes. Near-infrared photon counting is unprecedented and will permit observations that previously required excessive observation times, particularly with regards to dim photon-starved targets. The wavelength versatility of xxxxxx from the visible to 5-micron-plus makes these devices suitable for a broad range of applications, and their deployment is expected to be revolutionary for observational astronomy.	12358
Development of High Performance Hybrid Fuels	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx strategic goals call for innovation in space technology for our nation's explorative future. xxxxxxy phase paraffin fuel technology could enable practical hybrid motor use by producing high regression rates. Further, the creation of a robust and novel fuel, that overcomes paraffin mechanical property drawbacks, would produce high payoffs. The proposed research specifically will investigate polymer addition to paraffin grains, study the particle entrainment theory, evaluate hydride and metal additives, and demonstrate hypergolic ignition. We hope to find that polymers strengthen the low mechanical properties of paraffin. We will design, build, and demonstrate an experiment in which particle entrainment can be seen and understood. We will evaluate additives to increase performance and facilitate reliable and hypergolic ignition. Outreach to student run clubs and undergraduate engineers will also play an integral role demonstrating the promise of paraffin propellants through sounding rockets. A high performance paraffin based grain is a game-changing technology that could lead to the economical use of hybrid rockets.	12359

The program focus is on developing very high performance devices that are extremely robust and that can continuously operate at up to 500 C. The purpose of this program is to develop new high performance energy conversion devices that can act as a localized power generator for sensors and other devices.  The program has already made substantial headway in designing and fabricating simple, rugged, easily installed, high temperature energy conversion devices that can be easily installed on thruster components and other similar high temperature parts.  Fortuitously, these new energy conversion devices can equally function as high performance/high temperature capable vibration/pressure sensors.

Fused Reality for Enhanced Flight Test Capabilities, Phase II	2012-07-01	2018-07-19	In terms of relevancy to piloted evaluation, there remains no substitute for actual flight tests even when considering the fidelity and effectiveness of modern ground-based simulators. In addition to real world cueing, flight test provides subtle but key intangibles that cannot be duplicated in a ground-based simulator. There is, however, a cost to be paid for the benefits of flight in terms of budget, mission complexity, and safety. xxxxxx technologies and test procedures are therefore needed to maximize the investments and reduce some of the related costs associated with flight test. To address this need, xxxxxxs xxxxxx, xxxxxx. is developing a xxxxxx Reality (FR) xxxxxx system that allows a virtual environment to be integrated with the test aircraft so that tasks such as aerial refueling, formation flying, or approach and landing can be accomplished without additional aircraft or risk of operating in close proximity to the ground or other aircraft.

Accelerating Communication-Intensive Applications via Novel Data Compression Techniques, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxxessor speed has traditionally grown at a rate faster than that ofcommunication speed in computer and supercomputer networks, and it isexpected that this trend will continue even stronger, as we move into theexascale age in the upcoming decade. This has resulted in what is known asthe \"communication gap\" for communication-bound xxxxxx applications: theircommunication-to-computation time-ratio is so large, that the processorsremain mostly sub-utilized, with lots of \"disposable\" FLOPS available. Inthe last few years, scientists have proposed to use these disposable FLOPS(which otherwise would be wasted idling) to compress and decompress thecommunicated data so to effectively speed up the underlying application.xxxxxxhough the idea bears tremendous potential, efforts in this direction haveconsistently rendered very poor results, with typical resulting speedupsaveraging below 1.5x.

HIGH PERFORMANCE CARBON NANOTUBE BASED CONDUCTORS, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	This proposal is for the development of conductors with improved electrical conductivity and/or ampacity better than copper or aluminum.  Electrical conductors are key components for just about every power device or system. Copper is presently the conductor of choice, based on high performance, low cost, and ease of use. xxxxxxver, increasing demands for power and data push the need for more capacity, and the total contribution of electrical conductor weight to the system has become significant in aircraft, ships, rail, and automobiles. Thus, the development of a commercial, low-cost, light-weight, highly conductivity wire is an important objective to improve energy efficiency and reduce the weight/amp of power.In this xxxxxx I and eventual xxxxxx we propose the development for carbon nanotube (CNT) metal based current carrying composites.  We will focus on CNT additions to two base metals, Cu and Al, and the composites made with them as base metals.  We will focus on composites that have a high density of carbon nanotubes.  Our objective is developing methods to functionalize the connection between carbon nanotubes such that the connections have low resistance. We will focus on the properties of conductivity, and ampacity (maximum current which can be carried per area of cross section).   Our focus will be demonstrating methods of improvement in xxxxxx I and optimization of the best options in xxxxxx and also fabrication of long length wires in a xxxxxx effort.	12377

Formal Verification of Programming by Demonstration Systems, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Automated tools are quickly making inroads into casual computing environments, solving progressively more complex tasks.  xxxxxxver, these advancements still require trading reliability for convenience.  Frequent minor failures are acceptable in casual environments, but critical systems cannot make the same exchange.  The software systems that xxxxxx develops could greatly benefit from machine learning technologies that have been applied to casual computing, if the software developed by learning algorithms could be verified.We propose to apply formal methods to machine learning, and specifically Programming by Demonstration (PBD).  The existing technology readiness level is very low: no known verifiable PBD systems have been deployed and the existing research in the area is limited.  The xxxxxx I effort will result in publications and a prototype implementation of a verifiable PBD system using SMT solvers.  xxxxxx will build on xxxxxx I publications and prototypes to demonstrate increased verification capabilities through the application of more complex formal methods, such as model checking.  xxxxxx machine learning would allow for trainable systems that meet critical properties, but are still adaptable to specific use cases.

GFCR is awell-known and proven technology for trace gas detection and monitoring.xxxxxxver, its effectiveness in downlooking applications has been limited,primarily because variations in surface albedo degrade the performance.Our DAGR approach builds on traditional GFCR concepts and combinesseveral new key elements: two-dimensional detector arrays, pupil imaging(imaging the aperture), and a novel calibration approach.  With theseenhancements and appropriate signal processing, the DAGR designovercomes the historical limitations of GFCR in downlookingapplications.  In addition, this design significantly boosts thesensitivity and expands the dynamic range traditionally available tothese sensors.

Synthetic biology assemblies for sustainable space exploration	2012-01-01	2018-07-19	The work utilized synthetic biology to create sustainable food production processes by developing technology to efficiently convert inedible crop waste to supplemental high-protein food. The technology is based on modular enzyme complexes incorporating components from different organisms that have been shown to convert inaccessible cellulosic biomass like crop waste to soluble sugars more efficiently than enzymes without structural scaffolding. Long-duration crewed mission beyond low earth orbit will require significant supplies of food and closure of waste loops.&nbsp; Current crop growth systems produce approximately 50% inedible crop waste.&nbsp; xxxxxx-developed synthetic biology assemblies employ biomimicry to improve on naturally occurring enzymatic cellulosomes.&nbsp; These engineered enzyme complexes may be utlized to reduce crop waste by 50% and recover resources for food.Major constituents of crop waste include cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.&nbsp; Our bioengineered assemblies would significantly improve the conversion of these constitutents to sugars by eliminating the need for chemical pretreatment and reducing the large amount of enzymes typically required.&nbsp; This will be accomplished by engineering synthetic cellulosomes for specifi ratios of cellulololytic enzymes that target these specific cellulosic components.The project completed a number of laboratory assays to compare enzymatic activity on a substrate of a select grouping of proteins attached to our synthetic cellulosome versus the activity unattached, in solution.&nbsp; Selection of groups is based upon reported combinations of enzymes that occur natually in the cellulosome.&nbsp;&nbsp;	12382

Proactive Management of Aviation System Safety Risk	2010-09-10	2018-07-19	Aviation safety systems have undergone dramatic changes over the past fifty years.  If you take a look at the early technology in this area, you'll see that there was a lot of work done in the area of so-called 'built-in-testing' (BIT) which essentially tests connectivity between different components. xxxxxx has moved forward very far since that time.  With the massive storage systems and advanced sensors and other communications systems, we are now able to capture and store vast quantities of health and control related data.  This data is usually stored off-line for future analysis.  In many cases, we also have an abundance of human-written text reports that relate to known safety issues.  A key problem is to 'look' across all these data sources in order to find precursors to safety events.  xxxxxxhough humans do look at many aspects of the data, it is difficult, if not impossible for them to integrate all the information available in a meaningful way.  Other industries face this glut of data in their own way.  xxxxxx have invested heavily in business intelligence products based on data mining that are designed to convert data into actionable information to maximize their profits or other metrics.  The IVHM project is investing in data mining technologies to help sift through these massive data sets to uncover actionable information from a safety perspective.

Unified ke and algebraic stress (EASM) turbulence models, shown to adequately simulate fundamental high-speed jet data sets and now being validated with PIV data sets in a xxxxxx program, will be used. These jet turbulence models will be improved to provide agreement with base region data for cold air data sets. Hot jet base region data sets are not readily to evaluate xxxxxx number models affecting base heating. Inadequacies pose major issues with regard to analyzing base regions of rocket motors. A key innovation is to obtain high speed, hot jet base region data sets in the new, U.Miss/Oxford 12\" quiet tunnel facility using advanced diagnostic techniques, extending the hot, supersonic jet data of xxxxxx.

A Local Asynchronous Distributed Privacy Preserving Feature Selection Algorithm for Large Peer-to-Peer Networks	2010-09-22	2018-07-19	In this paper we develop a local distributed privacy preserving algorithm for feature selection in a large peer-to-peer environment. Feature selection is often used in machine learning for data compaction and efficient learning by eliminating the curse of dimensionality. There exist many solutions for feature selection when the data is located at a central location. xxxxxxver, it becomes extremely challenging to perform the same when the data is distributed across a large number of peers or machines. Centralizing the entire dataset or portions of it can be very costly and impractical because of the large number of data sources, the asynchronous nature of the peer-to-peer networks,dynamic nature of the data/network and privacy concerns. The solution proposed in this paper allows us to perform feature selection in an asynchronous fashion with a low communication overhead where each peer can specify its own privacy constraints. The algorithm works based on local interactions among participating nodes. We present results on real-world datasets in order to performance of the proposed algorithm.	12410

Super Ball Bot - Structures for Planetary Landing and Exploration	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	"Small, light-weight and low-cost missions will become increasingly important to xxxxxx exploration goals. Ideally teams of small, collapsible robots, weighing only a few kilograms apiece, will be conveniently packed during launch and would reliably separate and unpack at their destination. Such robots will allow rapid, reliable in-situ exploration of hazardous destination such as xxxxxx, where imprecise terrain knowledge and unstable precipitation cycles make single-robot exploration problematic. Unfortunately landing lightweight conventional robots is difficult with current technology. Current robot designs are delicate, requiring a complex combination of devices such as parachutes, retrorockets and impact balloons to minimize impact forces and to place a robot in a proper orientation. Instead, we are developing a radically different robot based on a \"tensegrity\" built purely upon tensile and compression elements. Such robots can be both a landing and a mobility platform allowing for a dramatically simpler mission profile and reduced costs. These multi-purpose robots can be light-weight, absorb strong impacts, are redundant against single-point failures, can recover from different landing orientations and are easy to collapse and uncollapse. These properties allow for unique mission profiles that can be carried out with low cost and high reliability. We believe tensegrity robot technology can play a critical role in future planetary exploration."	12414

The challenge addressed in this research is to develop new methods for automating the access and processing of raw sensor data, sharing data and methods among researchers, and integrating visualization throughout the process.  To meet this challenge, we will develop two new innovations: xxxxxx and COAST HPGIS. xxxxxx is the distributed network environment that maintains connectivity between a geo-browser and Geo-xxxxxxources (sensor data, GIS datasets, models, simulations, and metadata).  The xxxxxx maintains all metadata (and ontology) required to efficiently catalog, locate, store, access, and update Geo-xxxxxxources.  The significance of the xxxxxx creation is that it is a highly performing, scalable, network environment that encompasses: 1) a high performance cloud computing (xxxxxxC) environment, and 2) geographical context (HPGIS) whereby users can store, access, and manipulate extensive geographical resources.  The xxxxxx provides virtualized access to Internet2 and supercomputing resources for processing very large datasets and simulations.COAST HPGIS is an enhanced version of the xxxxxx COAST product which is based on the xxxxxx World Wind geo-browser.  COAST HPGIS includes plug-ins, overlays, and interfaces for COAST in order to enable interaction with the xxxxxx for real-time visualization of temporal and parametric simulations and models.	12417

Semiconductor Master Oscillator Power Amplifier for Gravity Gradiometer and Other Applications	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx GSFC has been working on an ESTO funded xxxxxxent xxxxxxubator Program (IIP) Cold Atom Gravity Gradiometer for xxxxxx since 2014.  Significant progresses have been made in instrument development.  One of the remaining tasks that is beyond the scope of the current IIP is an efficient power scaling approach and robust packaging for the three laser systems needed for future space deployment.  This effort is to begin the breadboard effort with emphasis on power scaling and packaging design that has a direct path for space.This proposed task is to initiate a path toward space qualifying the laser transmitters for gravity gradiometer.  These laser systems require the use of semiconductor tapered amplifiers (TAs) for power scaling of low power master oscillator.  The wavelength is centered in the 853 nm regime for Cesium atoms.    Tapered amplifiers was first introduced in the late 1990's and received a lot of interests due to the compact design and high brightness output.  Currently there are two major vendors offer this type of amplifiers.   For the Gravity Gradiometer effort, we have prepared a plan to bring the laser systems to xxxxxx in a 36 month program.   This IRAD effort represents an early start in performing studies in the optical, optomechanical, thermal and electrical systems that are required to mount, operate and inject light into and beam shaping the output beam is paramount in making the xxxxxx-6 plan successful.	12421
Integrated Wavefront Corrector, Phase II	2008-12-01	2018-07-19	One of the critical issues for xxxxxx missions requiring high contrast astrophysical imaging such as Terrestrial xxxxxxet Finder (xxxxxx) is wavefront control.  Without use of appropriate adaptive optics technology, it is impossible to obtain high quality imaging.  Normal adaptive optics systems utilize a series of discreet components to satisfy the correction requirements.  These consist of tip/tilt mirror and deformable mirrors.  xxxxxx has engaged in developing series of deformable mirrors and integrated adaptive optical components that will improve the optical quality of traditional wavefront control systems while simultaneously reducing system volume, weight and cost.  Our innovative integrated wavefront corrector will combine new types of deformable mirror, Photonex Meniscus, with tip/tilt stage with xxxxxx co-fired ceramic actuators.  The proposed effort is the result of a strategic vision to develop small robust wavefront corrector designed to be employed in space based optical systems.	12422

Low-Cost LIDAR for Wake Vortex Detection, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx has been tasked with supporting the development of key technologies to facilitate the evolution of xxxxxx xxxxxx to xxxxxx, the Next xxxxxxration Air Transportation xxxxxx.  One of these key technologies is the detection of wake vortices generated by other aircraft.  This is of particular concern during take-off and landing, both because the danger is particularly acute, and because of the large economic impact of having to widely space the aircraft.  About $5 billion of revenue is lost each year due to delays and lower throughput in our nation's airports.  xxxxxx-based lidars have the ability to detect and track wake vortices, but mounting similar systems on aircraft would be prohibitively expensive.  We propose to develop an intrinsically low-cost lidar that would be suitable for deployment on commercial airliners.  Costs are kept low through an extremely simple design: a passively Q-switched single-frequency laser that uses a fiber delay-line in place of a local oscillator.  The xxxxxx I effort will also include a modeling task to explore detecting wake vortices using an on-axis lidar instead of imaging from the side.  Since the primary flow components will be perpendicular to the lidar beam, we anticipate that looking for an increase in the width of the coherent return may prove to be the best approach.	12426

SHAPE: Shape Memory for a High Turn-Down Ratio	2013-06-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx designed for missions beyond low earth orbit (LEO) face a difficult thermal control challenge: they are required to reject a high heat load to warm orbital environments and a low heat load to cold transit environments, necessitating a quite high turn-down ratio. This difficult challenge can be transformed into a tractable design problem for arbitrarily high turn-down ratios through the use of shape memory alloys, materials that exhibit a temperature dependent phase change such that they can be easily deformed below the transition and recover a predefined shape above the transition. In fact, shape memory alloys can be trained to behave in a two-way manner so that it takes one shape above and another below the transition temperature. Such materials make possible a passively deployed heat rejection device which adjusts vehicle and environment loads based on its operating temperature alone. This project seeks to train a shape memory material and evaluate its behavior. This project trained a shape memory material to behave in a two-way manner and evaluated the capability of the two-way shape memory effect. A literature review identified an optimum training method involving alternating constrained and unconstrained thermal cycles. The effect of two bending strain rates were investigated through training rigs of differing radii, both trained in parallel. It was identified that in both cases cold working of the material results in some deformation to the austinite shape. This cold work deformation can be addressed through careful design of the hot set shape of the material.The results indicate that the greatest delta between austinite and martensite shapes is obtained through the lesser training strain (large radius rig). Projection of the results of two-way training of the material indicate that sufficient deformation can be trained to successfully employ in a full sized heat rejection device.	12428
A Circuit-Level Radiation Hardened-By-Design Approach for Standard CMOS	2015-10-01	2018-07-19	The primary objective of the research inquiry is to validate a circuit-level radiation hardening technique for digital and mixed-signal electronics. Computer simulations have indicated that the technique works; however, there have been no published experimental results validating it. To complete the primary objective, there are plans to experimentally validate the hardening technique and to quantify its effectiveness and any performance degradation introduced by it. In comparison with many device-level hardening techniques, this circuit-level technique may reduce the development time and costs of digital or mixed-signal electronics in craft bound for radiation-rich environments such as space.	12429

20mN, Variable Specific Impulse Colloid Thruster, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Colloid thrusters have long been known for their exceptional thrust efficiency and ability to operate over a range of specific impulse due to easily variable charge-to-mass ratio of emitted particles.  They have also been considered limited to only very low thrust levels, able to produce few microxxxxxx from individual emission sites.  This has motivated significant research into developing large microfabricated arrays of emitters in order to achieve greater thrust.  xxxxxx, using an alternate approach, avoids the complications of large emitter arrays while obtaining about 2.5 millixxxxxxxxcm2 and about 13,000 emission sites/cm2, and has proven this at the 0.1mN thrust level for over 450 operating hours.  xxxxxxd with colloids' variable xxxxxx capabilities and thrust/power superior to other electric propulsion devices, these new, high thrust colloid thrusters promise to enable new classes of missions benefiting from variable xxxxxx of 200-5000s (or greater) and variable thrusts up to and exceeding 20mN.For the xxxxxx I effort, xxxxxx shall perform a proof-of-concept demonstrating scalability of its proven 0.1mN, cylindrical emitter into a swept linear or annular configuration (to increase emission area while preserving the cross-section), resulting in a 5mN prototype.  For the subsequent xxxxxx, the emitter will be scaled up to 20mN and packaged and tested with fully integrated propellant storage/feedsystem and electronics.	12431

PM/IDE - An Integrated Development Environment for Planning Models, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	The Action Notation xxxxxx xxxxxxuage (xxxxxx) is a relatively new language for specifying planning domain models.  These models are created by someone who understands the planning domain and can express the essential aspects of the domain as xxxxxx variables, functions, and actions in a way that supports the generation and execution of safe, efficient, and robust plans.  An integrated development environment is essential for enabling programmers and non-programmers to create high-quality, large-scale xxxxxx models more easily.  Without such a tool, xxxxxx modeling will remain a tedious and difficult task that can be carried out only by the small number of people who have the necessary specialized programming skills and patience. This, in turn, will severely limit the exploitation of automated planning systems that rely on these models.We propose to develop PM/IDE, an integrated development environment (IDE) for constructing, reviewing, understanding, and testing planning domain models expressed in the Action Notation xxxxxx xxxxxxuage (xxxxxx) more quickly and effectively. During xxxxxx I, we will characterize the planning domain modeling task to identify the types of analyses and decisions that modelers carry out and the kinds of information they review and assess. xxxxxx on this understanding of the task, we will then identify and design useful PM/IDE capabilities and user-system interactions that help people develop xxxxxx models. The system design will specify user-system interactions, software functions and operations, and databases, knowledge bases, and algorithms that implement these functions. We will then develop a limited, proof-of-concept software prototype that demonstrates key parts of the PM/IDE's model editing, query, analysis, and visualization capabilities to demonstrate their utility and feasible implementation.	12433

3D Printed Silicon Carbide Scalable to Meter-Class Segments for Far-Infrared Surveyor, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	Using technology spun out from xxxxxx xxxxxxoratories, Goodman Technologies LLC with our Small Business and Minority xxxxxx partners (xxxxxx GTL) has demonstrated the feasibility of 3D printed metals and ceramics for low areal cost, ultra-lightweight mirrors and structures.  Our technology development roadmap shows production of the first meter-class mirror segments in time for the 2020 Decadal Survey. Our 1.5-meter hexagonal silicon carbide segments will meet or exceed all xxxxxx requirements for the primary mirror of a FIR Surveyor such as the Origins xxxxxx xxxxxx (OST), and may also provide a solution for the LUVOIR Surveyor.  Our analysis and internal research and development show that we will achieve an areal density of 7.75 kg/m2, a cost to print of $60K/segment, and an optical surface that has nanometer-scale tolerances.  Our encapsulated lattice construction provides a uniform CTE throughout the part for dimensional stability, incredible specific stiffness, and the added benefit of cryo-damping. Our process will also allow for direct embedding of electronics for active structures and segments, and the potential for actively cooling with helium for unprecedented low emissivity and thermal control. Finally, the particulate paste extrusion process may be very suitable for printing mirrors in the zero gravity of space.	12435

Hyperspectral Image Projector with Polarization Capability, Phase II	2013-07-01	2018-07-19	The goal of this proposal is improve testing and calibration of imaging sensors used on remote sensing platforms through the development of calibrated scene projector, the Polarization Hyperspectral Image Projector (PHIP).  Current calibration methods utilize spatially uniform optical radiation sources to ensure that sensors meet radiometric, polarization and spectral requirements, without the sensor being subjected to complex spatial /spectral / polarization imagery more typical of an operational scenario.  As a result, instrumentation is sent into orbit without proper characterization, neglecting the very real effects of stray light, optical cross-talk and earth-shine.  The proposed instrument will be capable of projecting realistic scenes to sensors under test, with accurate and high-resolution spectral/spatial /polarization tunability at each pixel.	12438

Room-Temperature Single-Photon Source for Secure Quantum Communication	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	"We are asking for four years of support for PhD student xxxxxx's work on a research project entitled \"Room temperature single photon source for secure quantum communication\". This project will be carried out at the Institute of xxxxxxics of the xxxxxxersity of Rochester, one of the world's best schools in quantum optics. To prepare for this project, xxxxxx has taken several advanced quantum optics courses at this xxxxxxersity, including a quantum optics and quantum information laboratory course. xxxxxx is planning to work in the laboratory of Dr. xxxxxx, who will be his PhD thesis advisor (xxxx).This proposal is for the creation of a room temperature single photon source device with photons exhibiting antibunching (all photons are separated in time). Such a device is a pivotal element in a quantum communication system. Quantum cryptography allows for the absolutely secure distribution of cryptographic keys between two parties, ensuring the security of encrypted communication. The practical realization of quantum cryptographic schemes has been held back in part due to the difficulty in the creation of a robust source capable of producing antibunched photons on demand and at room temperature. In many quantum cryptography systems currently used, highly attenuated laser sources are used instead of single photon sources. Attenuated laser light is contaminated with bunches of multiple photons, and is therefore not secure against photon number splitting attacks.Antibunched photons are created by focusing a laser beam to excite a single photon emitter. A single emitter will emit one photon at a time due to its finite fluorescence lifetime. To create such a device, it is necessary to study and evaluate a variety of single photon emitters in different hosts, including colloidal quantum dots, color centers in nanodiamonds, and rare-earth doped nanocrystals. We will also study how to enhance the fluorescence of these single emitters using microcavities, photonic crystals, and metamaterials as hosts. The geometry of microcavities will be used to give the emitted photons a definite polarization, which is necessary to increase the efficiency of quantum cryptography systems. This project's long term goal is the creation of a compact and efficient room-temperature single photon source device.Study of these materials will be accomplished using confocal fluorescence microscopy along with a xxxxxx and xxxxxx setup. xxxxxx has already begun research on this project, where he has observed antibunched photons emitted from single colloidal quantum dots in a chiral liquid crystal photonic bandgap microcavity. xxxxxx has also carried out spectral measurements of single colloidal quantum dots in these microcavities.This research is of unique interest to xxxxxx because of the potential of extending quantum communication to a space environment and allowing for absolutely secure communication on the global scale. A relevant project on quantum communication in space is being performed by xxxxxx's group at the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and is supported by the European xxxxxx Agency. xxxxxxearchers from this group have sent photons to an orbiting satellite and subsequently observed photons that are reflected from the satellite in a manner meant to mimic a single photon source. This experiment serves to demonstrate the feasibility of establishing a single photon quantum link between Earth and xxxxxx. We believe that this research is of interest of Dr. xxxxxx, the xxxxxx xxxxxx Quantum xxxxxx Experimental xxxxxx (xxxx). Quantum communications technology area is included in xxxxxx Communication and Navigation xxxxxxs xxxxxx, November 2010, page TAO5-21."	12446
A Far-Field Electro-Magnetic Tractor Beam	2012-09-01	2018-07-19	The goal of this project was to demonstrate&nbsp;and model a cooperative, attractive, longrange&nbsp;force between a pair of satellites. xxxxxx&nbsp;needs such a capability in order to fly satellite&nbsp;formations for future interferometer and&nbsp;telescope applications. The xxxxxx xxxxxxovative&nbsp;xxxxxxanced Concepts (NIAC) program funded three&nbsp;different efforts in an attempt to develop this&nbsp;capability, all of which suffered from serious&nbsp;limitations. We believed we could succeed&nbsp;where others had failed by using an antenna&nbsp;on one satellite to beam an electromagnetic&nbsp;signal to a second satellite on which an&nbsp;antenna was being driven synchronously&nbsp;with the incoming wave.&nbsp; When the project began, our intention&nbsp;was to develop a more accurate model of&nbsp;the forces that could be obtained between&nbsp;experimentally demonstrate these forces. We&nbsp;chose to operate at a frequency of 2.2 GHz&nbsp;and spent the next six months developing&nbsp;a torsion balance system to monitor the&nbsp;force between a fixed antenna and one that&nbsp;was suspended. In addition, we developed&nbsp;a theoretical model for this force that, by&nbsp;April 2012, led us to conclude that the&nbsp;attractive (or tractor beam) forces that could&nbsp;be achieved in this manner were too small.&nbsp;We had hoped for forces at the micro-xxxxxx&nbsp;level, but were only seeing them at the nano-xxxxxx level, which is insufficient for many&nbsp;applications.Consequently, we redirected&nbsp;our work to the goal of developing a shortrange&nbsp;tractor force between satellites, with&nbsp;great success. Over the next few months,&nbsp;we showed that, within a distance of&nbsp;roughly 100 m, it was feasible to construct a&nbsp;satellite position and orientation system that&nbsp;would allow a next-generation large space&nbsp;telescope to be built with freely floating&nbsp;mirror elements. We verified our predictions&nbsp;experimentally and showed that not only&nbsp;could the entire telescope be steered to&nbsp;a point anywhere in the sky within a few&nbsp;hours, but each element could be stably held&nbsp;to the optical wavelength criteria necessary&nbsp;for diffraction-limited performance.	12447

Aircraft Flight Envelope Identification through On-Board Model Based Estimation, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	To improve aviation safety with anticipated growth in capacity, it is necessary to develop flight control technologies that enable safe operations as anomalous conditions occur.  These developments are particularly important to reduce fatal loss of control accidents due to aircraft degradation and abrupt aerodynamic changes including upsets.  It is necessary to develop methods to identify and characterize anomalies in flight, as well as to estimate the impacts on the flight envelope and the ability to effect control forces for recovery and/or flight planning to achieve safe landing.  An approach to identify anomalies including aerodynamic upsets based on model-based fault detection methods will be combined with physics-based models to assess the impact on the aircraft flight envelope and controllability.  These tools will permit off-line analysis and will facilitate the development of on-board guidance and control algorithms to support xxxxxx goals for greater aircraft resiliency during adverse flight conditions.  In xxxxxx I, development and demonstration of a generalized system architecture to identify and assess the effects of aircraft anomalies will be performed, which builds upon previous work toward model-based aircraft upset detection.  xxxxxx I demonstrations will include simulation evaluation for a generic transport aircraft and test demonstration for a small unmanned aircraft.	12451

Real-Time Novel Holographic Monitoring of Airborne Trace Contaminants Onboard Space Vessels, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx challenges and mission requirements constantly emerge, establishing the need for versatile equipment and instruments to perform the new/expanded tasks. Alphaxxxxxx propose the development of a compact chemical monitoring system that provides highly sensitive, selective, and rapid detection of trace contaminants that will be able to meet such new requirements. The monitoring system will have low power consumption and remain stable and reliable for 12 months or longer. The system is based on unique technology of detecting a chemical reaction/interaction of the sought-after chemical in a (polymeric) transducer material through real-time dynamic optical holography. Significant advantages over other competing sensor technologies include: fast response and recovery times (sub second), low ppb sensitivity, low power and compact size. Additionally transducer elements may easily be replaced if they are damaged/contaminated.  The implementation of a single optical contact between the polymeric transducer element and the holographic detection system minimizes complications of replacing the sensing agents/transducers. Due to the rapid response, the transducer elements are only briefly exposed to the reacting/interacting chemical, drastically improving long-term stability and repeatability. When completed, this research should lead to the development of a compact state-of-the-art trace chemical monitoring system, with superior versatility and performance over other sensors.	12453

Integrated Structural Health Sensors for Inflatable Space Habitats, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	Luna proposes to continue development of integrated high-definition fiber optic sensors (HD-FOS) and carbon nanotube (CNT)-graphene piezoresistive sensors for inflatable space habitat materials to enable full coverage structural health monitoring (SHM) and impact detection. Inflatable habitats are key to reducing the weight of space structures, enabling future long term missions and planetary habitation. There is a need for monitoring the structural health of these habitats, as many of the methods used on earth are not applicable to the space environment or the materials used. To accomplish this goal, Luna has teamed with Embry-Riddle xxxxxx xxxxxxersity (ERAU) who is a leader in the development of CNT sensor technology. Luna is teaming with an established manufacturer to fabricate a sub-scale inflatable structure with integrated SHM sensors which will enable thorough characterization of the approach. During xxxxxx I, the team successfully demonstrated damage detection in an inflatable prototype as well as dynamic impact detection of soft goods layers with the technologies. xxxxxx will focus on increasing the xxxxxx of the sensing technologies and preparing for transition into future xxxxxx missions. xxxxxx will focus on commercializing the technology with xxxxxx and xxxxxx affiliates.	12456

Evaluating the Impact of Unrestricted Operation of Unmanned Aircraft Systems in the National Airspace System	2013-12-11	2018-07-19	xxxxxx aircraft systems (UAS) can be used for scientific, emergency management, and defense missions, among others. The existing federal air regulations, procedures, and technologies do not allow routine UAS access to xxxxxx xxxxxx (NAS), with the UAS being flown primarily within restricted airspaces. The current Certificate of Waiver of Authorization (COA) process requirement for UAS operations in the NAS are extremely resource intensive, lengthy, and often lacks the flexibility to meet the full mission needs. As the number of UAS operations increases, new methodologies will be needed to enable their safe and routine access to both restricted and unrestricted airspace in the NAS. This paper focuses on gaining a better understanding of growth of NAS usage in near-term NAS UAS demand in that airspace, and an assessment of the impact of unrestricted UAS deployment in the NAS that may facilitate the development of enabling methodologies. Using software simulations for demand growth generation and NAS operations the impact of UAS integration into the xxxxxx NAS is simulated to analyze its impact on the delay, congestion, loss of separation conflicts, fuel burn, and noise level. Our analyses show that while there is a slight increase in these factors due to additional UAS flight, this increase is minimal compared to the levels caused by the increase of commercial traffic alone.	12459

Hyperspectral Foveated Imaging Sensor for Objects Identification and Tracking, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxical tracking and identification sensors have numerous xxxxxx and non-xxxxxx applications. For example, airborne or spaceborne imaging sensors are used to visualize and track vehicles during launch and landing operations. Existing identification and tracking sensors cannot meet some of the advanced performance requirements including wide field of view (FOV) for panoramic situation awareness, high spatial resolution for detailed object shape discrimination, high spectral resolution for object material signature recognition, and fast response for transit event or moving objects tracking and identification, as well as low weight, volume and power requirements, xxxxxx There is a demand to investigate innovative and unconventional optical or hyperspectral imaging systems to enhance the ability of today's tracking and identification systems for xxxxxx as well as non-xxxxxx applications. xxxxxx Span xxxxxxo-xxxxxx xxxxxx. proposes herein a novel optical configuration that is capable of simultaneously providing wide FOV hyperspectral imaging for object detection and high spatial resolution in areas of interest without mechanical scanning for precise object recognition, positioning and tracking.

An Automated High Aspect Ratio Mesher for Computational Fluid Dynamics, Phase II	2014-02-01	2018-07-19	Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are routinely used while designing, analyzing, and optimizing air- and spacecraft. An important component of CFD simulations is mesh generation, or discretization into polygonal or polyhedral cells, of the domain being analyzed. The work will focus on the 3D implementation of the xxxxxx CHARM mesher, with solution-adaptive iteration for CFD and non-CFD applications. The proposed 3D method will incorporate and extend a previously developed method of generating field-guided hexahedral elements from a metric tensor field. While the fundamental technical approach -- a combination of metric tensor conditioning, metric-tracing mesher, and cell-packing mesher -- remains the same, there are many technical challenges specific to the 3D domain, including the following: - Investigation into conditioning of volume metric tensor fields - Investigation into the topology (structure) of volume metric tensor fields - xxxxxxing algorithms for the generation, repair, and adjustment of streamsurface arrangements - xxxxxxing algorithms to convert streamsurface arrangements to hex-dominant meshes - xxxxxxing algorithms to combine streamsurface- and packing-based meshes - Investigation into designing these algorithms for mesh adaptation rather than adaptive remeshing - Investigation of time and storage efficiency of these algorithms in a large-scale parallelism contextIn addition to the above, the goal is to generalize the solution in order to support its packaging and commercialization for a number of problem sets and target applications. This includes generalization of the solver-adaptive framework, creation of APIs to programatically expose core functions, and provide UI access to appropriately control and configure the application.	12462
A Novel Cyclic Catalytic Reformer for Hydrocarbon Fuels, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	This proposed Small Business xxxxxxovative xxxxxxearch (xxxxxx) xxxxxx I addresses development of a compact reformer system based on a cyclic partial oxidation (POx) technology for the purpose of generating hydrogen for fuel cell systems.  The need for improved reformers arises from:  1) the tendency of hydrocarbon fuels to deposit carbon on surfaces; 2) requirement of large quantities of steam; 3) a massive and voluminous fuel desulfurization stage; 4) substantial size and power consumption requirements; and 5) the lack of efficient, robust, and compact hydrogen separation technology.  These issues will be addressed by employment of a fixed bed cyclic redox system utilizing a metal oxide oxygen carrier for partial oxidation of fuel.  The reformer will consist of a small heated bed of sulfur tolerant partial oxidation catalyst and will operate by alternate exposure to air and vaporized fuel.  xxxxxx deposition and steam requirements and, possibly, the need for a  prereformer will be reduced or eliminated by this cyclic mode.  This cyclic operation will also eliminate the need for an expensive air separation unit or for H2/N2 separation.  xxxxxx I will consist of identification of catalysts, testing under cyclic conditions with real fuel, and integration of reformer and hydrogen separation modules.  On the basis of xxxxxx I data, a prototype system will be designed, fabricated, and tested during xxxxxx.	12463

Transient Acoustic Environment Prediction Tool for Launch Vehicles in Motion during Early Lift-Off, Phase I	2018-06-01	2018-07-19	Launch vehicles experience extreme acoustic loads dominated by rocket exhaust plume interactions with ground structures during lift-off, which can produce damaging vibro-acoustic loads on the vehicle and payloads if not properly understood and mitigated against. Existing capabilities for modeling the turbulent plume physics during early lift-off are too dissipative to accurately resolve the propagation of acoustic waves throughout the launch environment. Higher fidelity non-dissipative analysis tools are critically needed to design mitigation measures (such as water deluge) and launch pad geometry for current and future launch vehicles. This project will build upon existing capabilities to develop and deliver breakthrough technologies to drastically improve predictions of transient acoustic loading for launch vehicles in motion during early lift-off. xxxxxxovative hybrid CFD/CAA techniques based on RANS/LES modeling for acoustic generation physics and an unstructured discontinuous xxxxxx method will be employed to model long distance acoustic wave propagation along with vehicle motion using ideally-suited high-order accurate schemes. This new paradigm enables: (1) Greatly reduced dissipation and dispersion; (2) xxxxxx modeling of acoustic interactions with complex geometry; and (3) Automatic identification of transient acoustic environment including vehicle motion. xxxxxxs of this approach will be investigated and demonstrated during xxxxxx In xxxxxx, the methodology will be refined and validated against realistic targeted applications.	12465

3D Numerical Realization of FRP Mircrostructure from High-Res X-Ray CT	2016-10-01	2018-07-19	Invention, deployment, and improvements in safety and reliability of next-generation composite materials and structures will require significant advances in characterization, simulation, and overall understanding of failure at constituent-level length scales. xxxxxx on surface-based observations, over-simplification of numerical simulations, and continued dependence on empiricism severely hinders our ability to design and deploy future, innovative, composite materials and to fully realize revolutionary, structural-prognosis concepts like the xxxxxx. The objective of the proposed work is to initiate the realization of the xxxxxx concept for fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites by coupling state-of-the-art, nondestructive characterization techniques with three-dimensional, numerical modeling to study their constituent-level deformation and failure. Currently, characterization of constituent-level failure in state-of-the-art FRP composites is limited to two-dimensional observations (e.g. using optical or scanning-electron microscopy) often using post-mortem, destructive methods. Additionally, simulation of FRP deformation and failure at the constituent-level has been either homogenized or two-dimensionalized due to the perceived computational resources needed to perform three-dimensional finite-element (FE) analyses. In contrast, for metallic alloys, recent advances in high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy, X-ray computed tomography (CT), and supercomputing have enabled detailed characterization and simulation of deformation and failure at the grain-level scale.For FRP composites, volumetric imaging and numerical modeling of the constituent-level microstructure provides a unique set of challenges. For instance, in order to resolve accurately the shape and location of individual constituents (e.g. fibers), volumetric imaging must be performed at a sub-micron resolution. To date, a number of researchers have reported imaging FRPs using micro-focus or synchrotron source radiation X-ray CT; however, these techniques are currently limited to a 1-2 um resolution. Additionally, in order to simulate accurately the deformation and failure of FRP composites within a numerical framework, thousands of individual, randomly distributed fibers and the surrounding resin must be represented within a single three-dimensional model. xxxxxxment and implementation of these models will require tremendous computational power, and their performance will be evaluated using novel, constituent-level characterization and validation experiments. &nbsp;A recent survey of commercially available reconstruction codes highlighted the need for development of new software intended specifically for FRP composites. The new software will be based on novel pattern-recognition algorithms to extract two-dimensional spatial distribution of individual constituents, and will utilize multi-particle tracking algorithms to determine their shape in the third dimension. When completed, the new software will automatically generate realistic FE models based on real CT-derived data; or alternatively, the software will collect and generate extensive statistical information to create synthetic counterparts.The accuracy of the realistic or synthetic FE models will be evaluated with 4D in-situ constituent-level characterization and validation experiments. These experiments will be integrated with the X-ray CT microscope chamber and will enable remote sensing of the applied load or displacement, with a concurrent unobstructed rotation of the test specimen necessary for tomographic imaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;	12473

Consistent Particle-Continuum Modeling and Simulation of Flows in Strong Thermochemical Nonequilibrium	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	During hypersonic entry into a planetary atmosphere, a spacecraft transitions from free-molecular flow conditions to fully continuum conditions. When modeling and predicting the aerothermal environment encompassing the vehicle, the direct simulation xxxxxx (xxxxxx) particle method is used for the rarefied regime, whereas computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are used in the continuum regime. xxxxxxver, even within a mainly continuum flow, there may be local regions of nonequilibrium (rarefied flow) where the xxxxxx method is required for accuracy. Such regions include sharp leading edges, backshells of capsules, shock interactions, and possibly boundary layers. Similarly, in space, rocket plume flows transition from continuum inside the nozzle to rarefied in the plume. When rocket plumes resulting from on-orbit maneuvers impinge on other spacecraft surfaces, or when landing on a planetary (or asteroid) surface that has little atmosphere, the plume can become continuum again. For accurate simulation of such flows, a hybrid CFD-xxxxxx technique is required. This situation also arises in retro-rocket deceleration and aero-assist maneuvers high in a planetary atmosphere. xxxxxxstantial progress has been made on such a coupled algorithm over the past decade, to the point where 2D/axi-symmetric flows with thermal nonequilibrium can be solved accurately. xxxxxxver, the applications for which a hybrid method is practically useful are flows where pure xxxxxx simulation is intractable. This inherently involves complex 3D flows at high speeds where chemical reactions occur. Currently, chemical models used in xxxxxx and CFD do not seem to agree in the continuum (overlap) regime as required for a robust hybrid method. This project will investigate consistent particle-continuum chemistry models and then implement these models within a hybrid method. This will involve developing methods for averaging over trace species in xxxxxx in order to provide low-scatter averaged values for CFD regions of the flow. The project will also seek to maintain particle and continuum simulation meshes completely decoupled which will be required for tackling 3D complex geometry flows. This will involve investigation of mesh interpolation strategies that conserve mass, momentum, and energy. The result of this project will be a fully capable hybrid CFD-xxxxxx code that can be applied to a wide range of actual xxxxxx engineering applications. This new technology will constitute an accurate but general tool for solving a wide range of hypersonic flow problems spanning free-molecular to continuum.	12475

High-Rate Data Recorder	2017-09-01	2018-07-19	Design a low cost, compact, solid-state data recorder for suborbital vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp; The recorder will have a 45 GB minimum capacity and a record rate of at least 400 xxxxxx. Cost for recurring units will be nearly an eighth of the cost of commercial units with similar capabilities.The circuit board central to this design will take in data from a bus that it masters. That bus will be parallel and likely implemented using a stack through connector. The board will packetize the data. It will then tag it with time and an indication of the device that sourced it. The board will also require a port for configuration and diagnostics amd may require an additional port to read the memory. The board will also have an interface for time stamping. That interface would be either IRIGB or GPS. If GPS is used, the data could eventually be tagged with position as well, but the position feature is not covered by this proposal.The backplane bus when initialized will wait for one or more external interface cards to request a time slice of bus access. The mainboard will acknowledge the highest priority interface card thereby allowing it to record at least one frame of tagged data before acknowledging the next interface. An additional future enhancement could allow multiple slower devices to record at the same time by splitting the backplane data path.	12477

A low-pressure drop separation unit is needed to remove these sulfur compounds from regolith process streams that is compact and lightweight.

Intelligent, Semi-Automated Procedure Aid (ISAPA) for ISS Flight Control, Phase II	2008-12-01	2018-07-19	"We propose to develop the Intelligent, Semi-Automated xxxxxxedure Aid (ISAPA) intended for use by xxxxxx (xxxxxx) ground controllers to increase the efficiency and safety of flight operations while reducing costs for xxxxxx. ISAPA is innovative in that it is centered on a \"person-in-the-loop\" approach to automation. While ISAPA executes procedures, it asks the user for confirmations, decisions and allows the user to easily override. To increase situational awareness, the aid clearly presents, through notifications and advanced visualizations, what is being performed. The second major innovation is ISAPA's intuitive authoring tool which enables controllers (without programming skills) to build new and modify existing semi-automated procedures using drag-and-drop graphical widgets. As space station construction progresses and procedures change, authoring utilities allow the straightforward updating of procedures. ISAPA also supports gradual procedure automation, allowing flight controllers to migrate a manual procedure towards automation as confidence is gained. The system will integrate with existing mission control center systems, specifically: \"Thin xxxxxx\" for sending commands, \"Information xxxxxx Protocol\" for receiving telemetry, and use official formats, such as \"PRL\", for persisting procedure data. ISAPA will also include a simulator to assist in the validation process of procedures. During xxxxxx I, xxxxxx developed a prototype of the ISAPA execution tool, authoring tool and simulation tools while constructing two sample procedures based on real-life controller procedures. During xxxxxx, xxxxxx will develop a full ISAPA system ready for integration into the xxxxxx MCC. Special emphasis will be placed on compliance with xxxxxx ground console software certification.

Discovering System Health Anomalies using Data Mining Techniques	2010-09-22	2018-07-19	We discuss a statistical framework that underlies envelope detection schemes as well as dynamical models based on xxxxxx (HMM) that can encompass both discrete and continuous sensor measurements for use in xxxxxxted xxxxxx Health Management (ISHM) applications. The HMM allows for the rapid assimilation, analysis, and discovery of system anomalies.  We motivate our work with a discussion of an aviation problem where the identification of anomalous sequences is essential for safety reasons. The data in this application are discrete and continuous sensor measurements and can be dealt with seamlessly using the methods described here to discover anomalous flights. We specifically treat the problem of discovering anomalous features in the time series that may be hidden from the sensor suite and compare those methods to standardenvelope detection methods on test data designed to accentuate the differences between the two methods. Identificationof these hidden anomalies is crucial to building stable, reusable, and cost-efficient systems. We also discuss a data mining framework for the analysis and discovery of anomalies in high-dimensional time series of sensor measurements that would be found in an ISHM system. We conclude with recommendations that describe the tradeoffs in building an integrated scalable platform for robust anomaly detection in ISHM applications.	12481
RNA-seq analysis of mycobacteria stress response to microgravity	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	The aim of this work is to determine whether mycobacteria have enhanced virulence during space travel and what mechanisms they use to adapt to microgravity. M. marinum and LHM4 were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARV) in a rotary cell culture system (xxxxxxS) under normal gravity (NG) or low shear simulated microgravity (MG). To determine the effect of MG on the stress responses activated by the growth conditions we used xxxxxx to examine what genes were expressed. For xxxxxx the bacteria are harvested xxxxxx isolated and converted DNA (cDNA) and the cDNA sequenced. Using bioinformatics the amount of expression of the different M. marinum genes were compared between the NG and MG samples. To make sure that we were examining only gene expression changes due to MG only bacteria in early exponential growth were used in the xxxxxx studies. Triplicate NG and MG cultures were used to generate samples of bacteria grown for ~40 hrs. We also grew triplicate cultures for 4 days and then diluted them again and grew them for another ~40 hrs so we could examine gene expression from bacteria exposed for a longer time. In summary this study determined that waterborne mycobacteria alter their growth expression of stress responses and their sensitivity to oxidizing conditions when subjected to growth under MG.	12482

Advanced Pulse Compression System and Testbed, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Future space-borne cloud radars will require significant technical innovations for improving remote sensing of the Earth's atmosphere and that of other planetary bodies such as xxxxxx and xxxxxx moon xxxxxx, which have significant cloud cover. One critical innovation required is a pulse compression scheme at W-band (95 GHz) with ultra-low range sidelobe levels - on the order of 90 dB. The current space-borne cloud radar flying on xxxxxxSat is an outstanding technical achievement but lacks sensitivity to weakly reflecting low altitude clouds. Because these clouds play a significant role in modulation the Earth's radiation budget follow-on missions will have to address this limitation. Pulse compression (coded) waveforms can maximize transmitter duty cycle usage and thus system sensitivity. xxxxxxver, the reflection from the Earth's surface can easily mask the cloud signal via the coded waveforms range sidelobe response. The requirement for detecting these clouds from space is severe and significant innovations are required to meet them. The proposed research addresses this requirement and is supported by staff who have significant experience in xxxxxx system development, having built and flown the first airborne cloud radar utilizing FM chirp pulse compression.	12484

A Compact, Efficient Pyrolysis/Oxidation System for Solid Waste Resource Recovery in Space, Phase II	2013-06-01	2018-07-19	Pyrolysis processing can be used in near term missions for volume reduction, water recovery (drying), stabilization, and enhanced water and oxygen recovery through thermochemical reactions. For longer term missions, the added benefits include production of fuel, multi-purpose carbon, and reactants for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU). The objective of the xxxxxx I xxxxxx program was to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating pyrolysis, tar cracking, and oxidation steps into a compact, efficient, system for processing spacecraft solid wastes. This integration, which was based on a microwave pyrolysis/cracking/oxidation unit, has resulted in a significant reduction in energy consumption per gram (~70% when compared to a conventional unit), and an overall reduction in system complexity. These improvements should lead to a lower xxxxxx xxxxxx (ESM) for a full scale system.

400 Wh/kg Secondary Battery, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxLithium-ion battery technology will not provide significant breakthroughs beyond 200 Wh/kg. It will not provide adequate specific energy and cycle life for xxxxxx missions. It will not enable xxxxxx to reestablish its position of strategic technical advantage in portable energy storage. xxxxxxver, the next generation of secondary Li batteries is being developed in the US. It is based on lithium metal anodes and sulfur containing liquid cathodes. The sulfur-based cathode delivers a theoretical specific energy of 2450 Wh/kg, more than any other known cathode material of secondary cell. xxxxxx battery needs advanced technology for improved stabilization of xxxxxx anode in the corrosive environment of the liquid sulfur cathode. We propose a novel application of modern rocket fuel chemistry to create a self-healing, solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. xxxxxx cells equipped with this robust passivation will stably perform at 400 Wh/kg level for ~ 300 cycles.

Accident Tolerant Reactor Shutdown for NTP Systems, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	In this xxxxxx, USNC will develop an accident tolerant reactor shut-down system for Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) systems that will guarantee sub-criticality in the event of a water submersion accident. Reactor shut down during a water submersion accident is a crucial issue that must be addressed in NTP systems. The technology that USNC will develop in this xxxxxx is a low risk design feature that has notable advantages over existing reactor shut-down systems during water submersion accidents.USNC's accident tolerant reactor shut-down system will consist of enhanced control drums with significantly more criticality worth. USNC's enhanced worth control drums are a low risk modification to the traditional control drum where a small amount of fuel is added opposite to the neutron absorber. In addition, USNC's enhanced worth control drums will be moved deeper into the active core to further enhance the criticality worth of the control drums. The combination of adding fuel and moving the drums deeper into the active core will substantially increase the shutdown margin of the control drums and will be sufficient to maintain sub-criticality in the worst case water submersion accidents. xxxxxxic analysis codes such as MCNP6 and Serpent 2 will be utilized.	12490
Improved Trajectory Search Capability for Multi-Rendezvous and Flyby Missions	2017-09-01	2018-07-19	This work made&nbsp;vital improvements to a primitive trajectory search algorithm known as xxxxxx Exhaustive xxxxxx Search (NELLS). NELLS was created to work hand in hand as an initial guess generator for one of xxxxxx&rsquo;s primary preliminary design tools, EMTG, however NELLS currently lacks the capability necessary to design missions as the bodies visited increases.xxxxxx design involving high order (&gt; 5) planetary, moon and small body flybys and rendezvous are exponentially more mathmatically complex than simpler ones. The objectives of this work were:Improve the speed of trajectory generation by a factor of two for simple cases and an order of magnitude for complicated cases (trajectories that visit &gt; 5 bodies). The runtime in NELLS for individual, complex cases was&nbsp;as high as two weeks. A more effective search algorithm, using modern computational science techniques--implemented in this work--reduced run times&nbsp;significantly, allowing more cases to be computed.Create capability to rapidly generate multi-body trajectories which use deep-space maneuvers. Previously, NELLS was&nbsp;only capable of modeling four types of propulsion system impulses: launch, rendezvous arrival, rendezvous departure, and powered planetary flyby. These maneuver types cover&nbsp;a wide-range of missions, but there are some missions&nbsp;that simply cannot be flown without firing the spacecraft&rsquo;s propulsion system when not in proximity of a celestial body. xxxxxx of these so-called deep-space maneuvers is much more complex as there is no deterministic way of selecting the timing, size, and direction for every possible maneuver. xxxxxxver, a grid-search approach to placing such maneuvers provides a useful sample of the design space, which can later be optimized in other tools, and&nbsp;it is extremely important that such xxxxxxs be considered, as they enable many mission designs to destinations such as the outer planets, and asteroids.	12491

The DISCUS will be based on advanced distributed state estimation techniques, probabilistic guidance and control under collision avoidance and other relevant mission constraints, real-time contingency management including reactive collision avoidance with un-responsive team members, and low-level fault-tolerant control robust to subsystem and component failures. xxxxxxralized estimation is based on using RSS (Received Signal strength) and TOA (Time of Arrival) sensors, and fusion of information from EO (xxxxxx-xxxxxxical) sensors. xxxxxx and Control (G&C) is based on extensions of an innovative approach to swarm density control using a xxxxxx xxxxxx (MCMC) approach with guaranteed satisfaction of the ergodicity, motion, and safety constraints. Reactive collision avoidance will be based on extensions of a suite of SAA algorithms previously developed or under development by SSCI, while fault tolerance will be achieved by combining SSCI's approach to xxxxxx detection, Identification and Accommodation (FDIA) with low-level baseline control. Focus on xxxxxx I will be on the requirements and algorithm development, initial integration of a diverse suite of GNC algorithms, and feasibility demonstration on a simplified swarm simulation. xxxxxx will involve further maturation and full integration of DISCUS algorithms, and their demonstration under realistic conditions through hardware experiments.	12493
CFD-Based Over-Determined Trim Analysis for Optimum Aerodynamic Efficiency, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The overall objective of this xxxxxx I project is to develop a nonlinear trim module in xxxxxx for enabling the determined and over-determined trim analyses to be performed by xxxxxx with static aeroelastic effects. xxxxxx on an optimization formulation, the over-determined trim analysis can determine the optimum control surface scheduling of multiple control surfaces to achieve the best aerodynamic efficiency of the aircraft using the high-fidelity xxxxxx (N-S) solver in xxxxxx. At the critical loads flight conditions, the optimum control surface scheduling can minimize the design loads; leading to a lighter and more flexible structural design. At the cruise conditions, the optimum control surface scheduling can aeroelastically deform the more flexible structure to an optimum shape for induced drag minimization at cruise.One non-conventional design concept under investigation by xxxxxx is the xxxxxx Continuous Trailing Edge Flap (VCCTEF) system that utilizes multiple advanced actuators such as shape memory alloys (SMA) to achieve an optimum continuous deformed wing shape for obtaining the best aerodynamic efficiency. The VCCTEF design concept for the aerodynamic efficiency improvement will be ultimately verified by wind tunnel testing. xxxxxxver, such a wind tunnel testing will be impractically without a viable wind tunnel test plan that can provide a guideline for seeking the optimum actuation scheduling in the multi-dimensional design space. This viable wind tunnel test plan for testing the VCCTEF concept can be established by the xxxxxx nonlinear trim module.	12494

An environment with strong gravitational and magnetic field alterations synergizes to promote variations in Arabidopsis thaliana callus global transcriptional state	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	Using diamagnetic levitation we have exposed xxxxxx in vitro callus cultures to five environments with different levels of effective gravity (from levitation i.e. simulated mg* to 2g*) and magnetic fields (10.1 to 16.5 Tesla) and we have compared the results with those of similar experiments done in a Random Position xxxxxx (simulated micro g) and a xxxxxx (2g) free of high magnetic fields. xxxxxx analysis indicates that there are changes in overall gene expression of the cultured cells exposed to these unusual environments but also that gravitational and magnetic field produce synergic variations in the steady state of the transcriptional profile of xxxxxx.

Dynamic Stall Flow Control Through the Use of a Novel Plasma Based Actuator Technology, Phase I	2013-02-01	2018-07-19	Lynntech proposes a novel flow control methodology for airfoils undergoing dynamic stall. Dynamic stall refers to an aerodynamic phenomenon that is experienced by airfoils that undergo rapid changes in the flow angle of attack such as rotorcraft based airfoils, flapping wing technologies as well as fixed wing aircrafts undergoing sudden angle of attack changes. Dynamic stall is inherently an unsteady, non linear and complicated effect that can affect such flight parameters as lift, drag and airfoil stability.

TORC-SP: High Torque, Low Jitter Scissored-Pair CMG Technology, Phase II	2013-09-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx sees an increasing role in the near future for small satellites in the 5-100 kg size range. A potentially disruptive technology, small satellites are being eyed as platforms for the rapid demonstration of new technologies and important science missions. Currently, small satellite platforms struggle to balance the three critical tasks of collecting enough power, acquiring data and downlinking that data to ground stations in a way that maximizes mission return. For these small platforms, which usually do not benefit from steer-able solar arrays or gimbaled antennas and instruments, optimally balancing these three tasks strongly depends on the satellite's attitude control agility. xxxxxx agility has to do with rapid retargeting, fast transient settling and low jitter pointing control. Dr. xxxxxx, renowned spacecraft attitude control expert and Professor of xxxxxx xxxxxxing at xxxxxx State xxxxxxersity, stated that ultimately the \"measure of an agile satellite attitude control system is its ability to collect the maximum data from an area on the Earth that is rich in data-collection opportunities\". A logical corollary following from this statement would be that to maximize satellite data-collection, system designers should look to increase the satellite's agility. Furthermore, in addition to data-collection, the other two critical tasks of power collection and data downlink are also maximized as agility is increased.xxxxxx proposes to develop a low cost, high torque and low jitter satellite attitude control actuator derived from its Tiny Operationally xxxxxx CMG (TORC) design. This derivative product would combine two TORC units into a single scissored-pair configuration with SPA compatible interface. The result, a flight-certified TORC-SP, would be an actuator with the simple control interface of a reaction wheel that offers 1-2 orders of magnitude more torque per unit mass at drastically less power than a reaction wheel."	12508

Novel Solid Polymer Nanocomposite Electrolyte to Enable Lithium Metal Safely Cycling for Next Generation High Energy Battery	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx future missions demand safe, high specific energy (>400 Wh/kg) batteries. Current state-of-the-art (SOA) lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) can only provide xxxxxx-200 Wh/kg in energy capacity, which is unable to meet xxxxxx future energy goals, and also pose safety issues due to the use of liquid flammable electrolyte. There are intense on-going development activities to increase battery energy density. Among the promising next generation high energy battery chemistries are lithium/sulfur (Li/S) and lithium oxygen (Li/O2), in which lithium metal is used as the common anode. The use of Li metal as an anode material has emerged as one highly attractive option for achieving high-energy, next generation batteries. This is because Li has many advantages. It is the lightest metal, but also has the highest theoretical capacity (3876 mAh/g).  It also has the lowest potential (0V), which boosts whole cell voltage, and Li metal is 100% active material and requires no binder. Thus, Li metal is an ideal anode material for high energy battery chemistries. xxxxxxver, the reliable use of this exceptionally high capacity anode in a commercial rechargeable battery has not been achieved due to safety and reliability concerns resulting from thermal runaway and short-circuit issues due to dendritic growth on xxxxxx metal anode from lithium plating during charge-discharge cycles. The solid polymer nanocomposite electrolyte (xxxxxx) has been identified as a promising option to address lithium metal cycling safety. The xxxxxx is non-flammable and, by replacing the liquid flammable electrolyte, it eliminates leakage and fire hazard, in addition, it provides flexibility of design. This proposed solid polymer nanocomposite electrolyte addresses the challenges of achieving both high energy and safety for next generation battery. xxxxxxver, the xxxxxx technology must be developed to possess high conductivity, and thermal and mechanical properties conducive to robust Li metal cycling safely.   The goal is to maximize ionic conductivity, thermal and mechanical properties of the solid polymer nanocomposite electrolyte (SNPE) film by optimizing compositions, and identify the maximum current density for depressing Li dendrites for safe Li cycling.	12513
Development of Breakthrough Technology for Spaceflight Microwave Radiometers’ RFI Noise Detection and Mitigation Based on the HHT2	2013-09-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx passive radiometry makes use of natural thermal emissions to remotely sense Earth phenomena of interest to science (surface moisture, for example) in microwave L-band where a terrestrial source thermal emission signal to space suffers less attenuation by the intervening atmosphere. Unfortunately, the relative insensitivity of the L-band region to atmospheric effects also makes it an extremely attractive spectral range for the wireless communications & radars that are causing radio frequency interference (RFI) with the spaceflight science radiometer instrument's terrestrial phenomenon signal of interest. Excision of just the RFI component from the composite signal is a tall challenge to the state-of-the-art technologies (that excise the entire sample where RFI is detected. The goals are: 1.1 xxxxxxearch and develop a unique xxxxxx Empirical Mode Decomposition Component for 2-Dimensions (HHT2 EMD2) functionality superseding each of the numerous state-of-the-art on-board and ground RFI detection and sample excision algorithms; 1.2 xxxxxx the HHT2 based RFI xxxxxxion and Mitigation (HHT2-RFI-DM ) system - a unified  RFI detection and RFI(t) component only excision groundbreaking technology.xxxxxx active/passive radiometer is the premier instrument for remote sensing of Earth. xxxxxxver, it carries the price of non-linear response by its horn-receiver sensor and the radiometer operational frequency band of interest is overlapping with man-made radio-frequency interference sources (RFI). The state-of-the-art RFI detection and mitigation is paramount and it encompasses a variety of on-board instrumentation analog techniques, as well as on-board and ground digital data processing, employing dozens of RFI detection and mitigation computational algorithms (RFI-DM). For example, advanced algorithms for the xxxxxx Moisture xxxxxxxxPassive Mission (SMAP) microwave radiometer are run on the SMAP science data system ground support equipment which complements the on-board processing of sub-sampled bands and computation of data moments. For SMAP high-resolution mode of 3 km with a radiometric accuracy of 0.4 dB in order to meet the mission's science requirements, the RFI poses a significant error source for that measurement, as an interference-to-signal ratio of 10 dB may use the entire error budget.  SMAP's RFI-DM is an integral part of its single radiometer instrument system and is using a two-fold RFI-DM strategy – on-board analog RF sub-channeling and on-board and ground RFI-DM computational techniques that detect and mitigate many RFI types. xxxxxxver, there remains an area of highly non-linear RFI noise not covered by these state-of-the-art. Furthermore, future Earth and planetary radiometers will carry arrays of receivers and require new technologies for RFI detection and mitigation. For example, the ESA's xxxxxx soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) mission payload instrument, xxxxxx Imaging xxxxxx using Aperture Synthesis, consists of 69 individual radiometer receivers. By the means of interferometry the measurements from all the receivers are combined and an image from the target is obtained. The RFI-DM for radiometric images is in embryonic state. The task is to find significantly advanced miniaturized engineering solutions for the RFI-DM problem. The recently developed xxxxxx technologies – xxxxxx (HHT-DPS-RT) for 1-D (HHT1) and 2-D (HHT2), can be further researched and developed for detecting and mitigating RFI noise in highly non-linear regions and for  image radiometers. xxxxxxearch and development of a consolidated beyond-frontier reference RFI-DM HHT-based technology (RFI-DM-HHT) would simplify on-board RF signal processing and significantly improve efficiency and capability of RFI-DM on-board processing system. It will, as well, enhance ground systems data processing in RFI detection and mitigation domain by an order of magnitude and reduce the RFI-DM system overall  cost.                                           Our RFI-DM-HHT research and development goal is based on our recent research and development of the HHT1 and the HHT2 (IRAD-FY2010, IRAD-xxxxxx – xxxxxx patents pending) and will focus on two components:                                 1.1 We propose to research and develop  the RFI-DM-HHT – a novel technology for spaceflight microwave radiometers' RFI noise detection and mitigation based on xxxxxx. This technology covers the state-of-the-art and allows an order of magnitude reduction in complexity of on-board analog signal sampling for separating RF signal into multiple bins, since HHT1 does it automatically in digital domain by extracting IMFs of different scales from the non-linear and non–stationary composite signal. FFT and other transforms for such work are not suitable since received RF signal is non-linear and non-stationary, for which the HHT has an advantageous ability.                    1.2 The state-of-the-art is based on on-board sub-channeling and on the ground computation of \"kurtosis\" for pulsed RFI, thresholding, reference lookup tables and statistical analysis of raw count moments. The RFI-DM-HHT may deliver an effective natural decomposition of antenna signal into a specified  number of IMFs instead of on-board RF analog hardware to filter signal into selected sub-bands, followed by extensive ground processing, as posted in 1.1.  The RFI-DM-HHT will be further developed beyond the-sate-of-the-art to mitigate RFI sources not covered by the-state-of-the-art and mitigate new RFI sources. It will also be developed for RFI detection in image radiometers that is presently non-existent. These breakthrough RFI-DM-HHT technologies are all long-term new business return opportunities for GSFC and deliver significant enhancements in the RFI detection and mitigation domain.                                                "	12514
Deployable Drag Device for Launch Vehicle Upper Stage Deorbit	2017-08-01	2018-07-19	One of the biggest problems facing spaceflight today is the accumulation of orbital debris because it threatens the successful operation and lifespan of existing satellites. The predominant cause of orbital debris is the jettisoning of launch vehicle upper stages after their usefulness is over once a rocket reaches orbit altitude. While their orbit slowly decays, these obsolete upper stages then share an orbit with valuable satellites presenting a danger to those satellites by either hitting them or hitting other rocket bodies and breaking into smaller pieces which can be just as dangerous but become much harder to track. These collisions potentially add an exponentially growing number of debris in orbit.One way to reduce the number of rocket bodies in orbit is to have a drag device connected to the upper stage of the launch vehicle that deploys once it is jettisoned from the payload. The intent of this device is to increase atmospheric drag and thus accelerate deorbit. By reducing the time debris is in orbit we will reduce the amount of debris thereby reducing the threat to satellites. When designing this device, it is important to minimize the packaged mass and volume of the final design to minimize the impact on the launch vehicle payload capacity. This project requires background research to accumulate data on upper stage sizes and masses, final orbits, and the current time it takes them to deorbit. An orbital mechanics review would be required to determine the effectiveness of the drag device compared to size. This research will help to develop initial requirements to start the design phase of the device.The design depends greatly on the materials and the dynamics of the device. It requires a flexible membrane to allow packaging, and foldable booms to stiffen the membrane once it is deployed. These will most likely be made from composite materials. The dynamics will be determined through computer models and simulations, followed by the building of various prototypes to test the deployment and folding configurations. xxxxxx the deployment will occur in three phases. The first is by offloading the gravity within the lab to facilitate quick design iterations based on test results. The second is testing the deployment in a reduced gravity aircraft for higher fidelity testing. Finally, it will be tested in space on either a cubesat or launch vehicle upper stage. The results of each round of testing will allow the design and models to be improved.The research required for this device applies to the technology area 12.3 Mechanical xxxxxxs because of the subsection 12.3.1 xxxxxx, xxxxxx and xxxxxxs. This lower level element emphasizes the importance of being able to overcome the constraints of launch vehicle fairing size. The area of deployable space structures is still a fairly new research topic with a lot of room for development and study. This project will definitely help to increase the body of knowledge on the dynamics, design techniques, and testing techniques. The necessity for a reliable restraint/release mechanism will benefit development research, as well, as this is a very important aspect of any deployment system. The flexible sail material will require development and research into how flexible membranes stow and respond to the environment of space. Finally, it is possible that the goal of this project will necessitate a fairly large deployable, which would increase research data for large lightweight stiff deployables.	12515

There currently exists no system that offers the necessary combination of availability, platform compatibility, power, and ease-of-use, requiring users to compromise in one or more area. We will build a solution that meets each of these requirements by leveraging and improving the internal API of xxxxxx, GSFC&rsquo;s class-B, in-house, open-source mission analysis and design system, enabling significant cost savings and capability improvements for flight projects, in-house developers, and external partners. This project will build an open-source, cross-platform mission analysis and design application programming interface (API) that leverages the existing low-level internal API of GSFC&rsquo;s xxxxxxral Mission xxxxxx Tool (xxxxxx), demonstrate its real-world use, and improve it to meet customer needs. The three primary objectives are:Expose the internal xxxxxx API as-is, via the use of an automated interface generator.Use the resulting API in at least three prototype client implementations covering a range of use cases.xxxxxxorporate lessons learned and feedback to make targeted, high-impact improvements and enhancements.There are multiple use cases for this API with differing levels of complexity:Automation: In this highest-level case, an external tool is used to automate a repeatable, parameterized process, such as batch execution of a trajectory design across a series of launch opportunities. This is currently accomplished with xxxxxx by writing a template script and an automation driver that fills the template via &ldquo;search and replace&rdquo; text processing, then runs the xxxxxx executable, a process that is cumbersome and error-prone. This effort will enable direct loading, manipulation and execution of a pre-configured script, without the current overhead.xxxxxx xxxxxxment: In this case, an external tool seeks to interface with xxxxxx, either to supply data or retrieve it. An example is a system that performs low-fidelity initial design, then seeks to load the resulting design into xxxxxx for high-fidelity modeling. Currently, such a system must implement the syntax of xxxxxx script language internally, a task that requires significant effort to implement robustly. With this development, such a tool can build the appropriate mission within the API, then use xxxxxx&rsquo;s own tools to either export a script that is guaranteed to be correct, or run the mission directly.xxxxxxtion: In this lowest-level case, an external tool encapsulates some or all of xxxxxx as an integral component to perform a specialized function for which xxxxxx itself was not designed. This could include using xxxxxx&rsquo;s built-in utilities (e.g. time conversion) as part of a mission-specific tool, or using the API as a low-level propagation engine integrating custom models. This type of use case is currently only possible if the client tool is also written in xxxxxx. This effort will make it available to a much larger set of environments, and will also enhance its ease-of-use.This project is a collaboration between the xxxxxx development team at xxxxxx xxxxxx and multiple partners that have greed to develop prototype client tools against the API.	12517
Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature	2018-06-25	2018-07-19	xxxxxx nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed.

Aircraft Based Imaging Probe for the Study of Icing Environments, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	Icing environments are of great concern in commercial and military aviation. An aircraft-based, imaging probe is being proposed for the reliable and accurate measurement of liquid water content (LWC) and droplet size distributions in environments variously referred to as freezing rain, freezing drizzle, supercooled drizzle drops, and supercooled large drops (SLD). The innovative aspect of the proposed probe is the use of multiple laser beams (of differing wavelengths) to create high quality shadows of individual particles (droplets and ice crystals) on a 2-d CCD array.  Conventional aircraft-based probes such as the OAP suffer from measurement uncertainties arising from the detection of droplets that are out-of-focus. The use of multiple intersecting laser beams will also minimize the background noise created by other particles that may be present along the laser beam path but outside of the measurement volume. Finally, the incorporation of a means for differentiating between ice-crystals and droplets, while counting and measuring both, allows computation of water content in both liquid and solid phases. These innovations, and the other features of the probe to be discussed later, directly address the need for aircraft-based icing monitoring systems that xxxxxx has identified in topic A1.02 of the 2003 xxxxxx solicitation.	12519

The EMOS is based on use of novel materials for high-temperature operation and uniquely designed fiber optic microsensors. The EMOS system is capable of simultaneously measuring multiple TPS response parameters (e.g., pressure, temperature, and heat flux) using a suite of miniature (diameter 1500 degrees C and measurement errors within 0.4% for temperature sensors, 0.2% for pressure sensors, and 20% for heat flux measurement. In xxxxxx I POC will demonstrate the feasibility of EMOS for in-situ measurement of TPS responses in an aerothermal environment by fabricating and testing a technology readiness level (xxxxxx)-4 prototype, with the goal of achieving xxxxxx-6 by the end of xxxxxx.	12521
An Advanced Open-Source Aircraft Design Platform for Personal Air Vehicle Geometry, Aerodynamics, and Structures, Phase I	2007-01-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxovators working to revolutionize air travel through personal aviation pioneers need innovative aircraft design tools.  Vehicle xxxxxx (VSP) is an aircraft geometry tool for rapid evaluation of advanced design concepts.  VSP will be extended to include support for the modeling of aircraft structural layout and a modular system for integrating engineering analyses.  These modifications will allow VSP to unify geometry, aerodynamics, and structures in the early design of advanced concepts.  VSP will be released as open-source; a community for its development will be initiated and fostered.  Open distribution will ensure that VSP is available to all, thereby supporting personal aviation innovators, universities, xxxxxx, and the whole aerospace industry.  This will enable a new level of fidelity and accuracy in personal aircraft design needed to meet the aggressive goals required for the success of personal air vehicles.  An improved and open VSP will catalyze personal aviation by supporting breakthroughs in noise and cost reduction and ease of operations.	12522

Vision-Based Navigation for Formation Flight onboard ISS, Phase I	2018-06-01	2018-07-19	The RINGS project (xxxxxxonant Inductive Near-field xxxxxxration xxxxxxs) was a DAxxxxxx-funded effort to demonstrate xxxxxxmagnetic xxxxxxion xxxxxx and wireless power transfer in microgravity. xxxxxxtion inconsistencies in both hardware and software prevented the experiment from achieving its objectives during the planned test sessions. A later project supported by xxxxxx ARC focused on the assessment, diagnostics, corrections and ground testing of RINGS, to understand the reasons for the failure of RINGS to complete its science sessions, and assess the possibility of correcting these errors in future missions. The assessment concluded that RINGS can be successfully used in future science sessions provided that a new metrology system is available to navigate RINGS in real time onboard ISxxxxxx proposed study supports the implementation, integration and ground testing of vision-based navigation of RINGS, using the Smartphone Video xxxxxx xxxxxx (SVGS) with SPHERES (Synchronized Position Hold Engage and Reorient Experimental xxxxxx). SVGS was developed at xxxxxx MSFC for application on cubesats and small satellites to enable autonomous rendezvous and capture, and formation flying. SPHERES are free-flying robots that have been used for numerous experiments on board ISxxxxxxir metrology system is based on ultrasonic beacons, and does not operate correctly with large flyers due to multi-path signal reflections. The main objective of this study is the integration of SVGS (as vision-based position and attitude sensor) with the SPHERES xxxxxx environment. Successful integration will be demonstrated by 3DOF vision-based guidance, navigation and motion control experiments on a flat floor using the RINGS ground units available at xxxxxx Tech. Performance assessment will be done by a vision-based metrology system based on data fusion using high resolution cameras. A path forward for deployment on xxxxxx will be developed in coordination with xxxxxx ARC.	12526
Safe, Non-Corrosive Dielectric Fluid for Stagnating Radiator Thermal Control System, Phase II	2010-06-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxment Corporation proposes to develop a single-loop, non-toxic, active pumped radiator design with robust, reliable operation near stagnation regimes as expected to be experienced by xxxxxx xxxxxxn xxxxxx Exploration Vehicle (CEV), the xxxxxx (LSAM) and thermal control systems of xxxxxx at the lunar pole.  This will be achieved through an innovative use of a common terrestrial-application, safe fluid that has lower temperature stalling characteristics over typical space-based radiator fluids.  xxxxxx has already shown this fluid to stall per predictions and, through a previous contract, xxxxxx has demonstrated its capability to perform spacecraft heat rejection.  The significance of this work is to understand stagnation behavior, both planned and mitigated, and then design and demonstrate a robust and reliable radiator performance based on this knew found knowledge.	12527

Amazon Web Services: Downscaled Climate Projections (NEX-DCP30)	2015-06-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx Earth Exchange (NEX) Downscaled Climate Projections (NEX-DCP30) dataset is comprised of downscaled climate scenarios for the conterminous xxxxxx that are derived from the xxxxxxral xxxxxx (GCM) runs conducted under the Coupled xxxxxx Intercomparison Project xxxxxx 5 (xxxxxx) [xxxxxx 2012] and across the four greenhouse gas emissions scenarios known as Representative xxxxxx (RCPs) [xxxxxx 2011] developed for the Fifth Assessment xxxxxx of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate xxxxxxe (IPCC AR5). The dataset includes downscaled projections from 33 models, as well as ensemble statistics calculated for each RCP from all model runs available. The purpose of these datasets is to provide a set of high resolution, bias-corrected climate change projections that can be used to evaluate climate change impacts on processes that are sensitive to finer-scale climate gradients and the effects of local topography on climate conditions. Each of the climate projections includes monthly averaged maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation for the periods from 1950 through 2005 (xxxxxx) and from 2006 to 2099 (Prospective xxxxxx).	12529
Anomaly Detection to Improve Airspace Safety and Efficiency, Phase II	2018-05-01	2018-07-19	As the air transportation system becomes more autonomous in the coming years, there will be an increasing need for monitoring capabilities that operate in the background to identify anomalous behaviors indicating safety or efficiency deficiencies. Today, these behaviors are largely detected after an incident has occurred. In xxxxxxy 2013, an xxxxxx 777 flew too low approaching xxxxxx (SFO), its tail hitting a seawall and crashing into the runway. Three people died and 180 were injured. This type of anomalous behavior (i.e. foreign pilots consistently flying too low into SFO on visual approach) could have been detected prior to the crash because the data was available, but no one was looking at it. xxxxxx proposes to develop a semi-autonomous background monitoring system to apply this type of data mining and data discovery to flight track data in order to identify opportunities for improvements to safety and efficiency in airspace operations. In the xxxxxx I effort, xxxxxx demonstrated a proof-of-concept statistical approach that we call the Normalcy Score Broker (NSB), which uses historical flight data to develop models of normal behavior, and then applies statistical methods to combine multiple features into a single score for identifying outliers. xxxxxx has used this same NSB technique to develop operational systems for customers in the land and maritime domains.In the xxxxxx, we propose to extend the techniques to process at scale, whether for real-time streaming data or for efficient analyses on forensic repositories. In addition to generating new features associated with clusters of flights interacting with each other, we propose to incorporate greater context (e.g., flight behavior in the presence of convective weather) and learning techniques to reduce false positives based on operator feedback on the relevance of the reported anomalies. We will test and evaluate our software on the xxxxxx xxxxxx-based SMART-NAS xxxxxx.	12530

Specially designed dust collectors are prepared for flight and processed after flight in an ultraclean (Class-100) laboratory constructed for this purpose at xxxxxx (JSC) in xxxxxx, xxxxxx. xxxxxx are individually retrieved from the collectors, examined and cataloged, and then made available to the scientific community for research. Cosmic dust thereby joins lunar samples and meteorites as an additional source of extraterrestrial materials for scientific study.	12531
Dropsonde System for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are assuming more numerous and increasingly important roles in global environmental and atmospheric research.  There is a corresponding growth in equipment needs for UAVs so that they may meet their mission goals.  Some critical measurement needs can only be satisfied by in-situ measurements.  xxxxxx examples of such measurements include detailed atmospheric profiles, point meteorological conditions on the surface, and in-situ measurements for calibration and validation of remote sensing systems.  A scalable dropsonde launcher will be developed that will be able to fit a range of UAVs.  It will be able to launch a variety of dropsondes derived from xxxxxx's existing radiosonde and dropsonde families.  xxxxxxs for high-precision, high-density, and surface-based measurements will be developed.  xxxxxx I will involve designing a launcher that uses an existing xxxxxx dropsonde and fits into a representative UAV provided by xxxxxxilla xxxxxx.  The launcher will be demonstrated in the laboratory and in a high-speed airflow environment.  The ultimate result of the project will be a dropsonde system that can be fitted to many xxxxxx UAVs and enable them to gather in-situ atmospheric profiles and surface measurements using dropsondes.	12532
Flexible 2-Phase Thermal Strap for Small Sats, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	A rapidly growing class of spacecraft are xxxxxx and SmallSats.  Current xxxxxx missions indicate an equally rapid growth of technological capabilities to support these small spacecraft.  xxxxxxver, large deployable solar arrays and closely packed electronic suites are giving rise to an increasing demand for thermal management technologies in xxxxxx and SmallSats.  xxxxxx is currently seeking more sophisticated thermal control technologies for this class of spacecraft, thus enabling revolutionary capabilities within small satellites.In response to the need for advanced heat transfer components for improved thermal management onboard xxxxxx and SmallSats, i2C xxxxxxutions proposes to develop space-rated flexible 2-phase thermal straps with vacuum survivability and operational capability.  The current effort will build upon current and previous Department of Defense-funded developments of 2-phase thermal management components with thermal conductivities in excess of 1500 W/m-K and thicknesses of less than 1-mm.  Additionally, a world-class CubeSat team including xxxxxxxxxxxx, leaders in the thermal analysis of SmallSats, has been assembled to assist in application development and demonstration.  The xxxxxx I program will culminate with a proof-of-concept demonstration of a 2-phase thermal strap designed and manufactured for operation in the harsh space environment. The successful development of the proposed space-rated thermal strap will open the door to a new class of future CubeSat and SmallSat missions.	12533
Dual –frequency Cloud Radar (DCR) System for EV-3 Missions and Beyond	2013-09-01	2018-07-19	This work will develop a xxxxxx Hawk installation plan for a dual frequency (W- and xxxxxx) radar that combines two existing xxxxxx radars, xxxxxx xxxxxx (CRS) and High xxxxxx Wind and Precipitation Imaging xxxxxx (HIWRAP).  The main part of the effort will focus on an implementation plan to reduce costs and risks for upcoming opportunities such as xxxxxx Earth Venture (EV-3) and xxxxxx Chemsitry Ecosystem (ACE) algorithm development activity.The effort will involve a mechanical and thermal study for installation of CRS into the xxxxxx Hawk, RF design for integrating the HIWRAP xxxxxx transceiver with CRS and a new subscale prototype antenna for ACE, and specification and testing of a Ka-/W-band radome necessary in front of the antenna. The proposed work will be a solid design concept for a dual-frequency CRS that can be readily implemented on the xxxxxx Hawk. Since CRS is currently single frequency (W-band) and the NGES antenna is dual-frequency (Ka- and W-band), this effort investigates what is necessary to use the HIWRAP xxxxxx transceiver with CRS timing and other interfaces. Finally, the xxxxxx Hawk installation will require a dual-frequency radome and part of this effort will investigate suitable radome materials that is transparent at at both operating frequencies.	12534
Characterization and Modeling of Neutron and Gamma-Ray Radiation Damage in Silicon Carbide Semi-Conductor Materials and Silica Optical Fibers at Cryogenic Temperature	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	When radiation is incident upon a material, it can knock atoms within the lattice out of their proper positions. xxxxxxver, this damage can often be overcome because when lattice atoms have energy, the dislocated (interstitial) atoms can go back to their original positions or fill other vacancies left by other dislocated atoms. This process of annealing allows most damages to be repaired. Damages that are not annealed can affect the structural stability of a material, the electrical properties of a material and the optical properties of a material. Furthermore, annealing is less effective at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures because the temperature of a solid is a measurement of the kinetic energy in the lattice atoms. This means that radiation at lower temperatures could cause greater damage in a specific material, since less of the damage would anneal. This proposal details the methods for researching this phenomenon in silicon carbide and silica optical fiber. These two materials are of particular importance because semi-conductor material like silicon carbide is prevalent in many current and future electronic designs and silica optical fibers can be used for fast and efficient electronics and communication. Because xxxxxx operates advanced electronics and communication systems in the extremely cold conditions of space, these materials are of particular importance. xxxxxx hardware is subjected to heightened levels of space background radiation. But more importantly, some deep space probes like Viking I use nuclear fuel, and future space propulsion systems involve the use of a nuclear reactor. By subjecting the space electronics and communications systems to these high levels of radioactivity at low temperatures, it is evident that is hypothesized that a heightened level of radiation damage will occur. If enough damage occurs, it could component failure and possible mission failure. This research project addresses a number of xxxxxx xxxxxx would be applicable to the goals of multiple research divisions within xxxxxx. For example, the xxxxxx xxxxxx's xxxxxxn and xxxxxxo-xxxxxxnic Devices Branch would be able to use the specific research outlined in this proposal when designing next generation spacecraft electronics.I plan to investigate the radiation damage in semi-conductor material, silicon carbide and in silica fiber optics cables at very low temperatures. This research would be the basic work behind a Masters Thesis in nuclear engineering, which would provide me with nuclear engineering research experience with implications to many related fields. The research proposal will outline work that is aligned with my educational goals as well as xxxxxx research goals. In this research project, (1) xxxxxx and silica optical fiber will be irradiated at the xxxxxx State xxxxxxersity xxxxxxearch Reactor at varying fluences of neutron and gamma-ray irradiation and the irradiation damage will be characterized at low temperatures and while the temperature rises to room temperature, 2) the neutron irradiation will be modeled in order to determine a theoretical model for neutron damage, (3) the results of the experiment will be compared with the model.	12535
Biodegradable Long Shelf Life Food Packaging Material, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	Long shelf life food packaging is a critical to maintaining the crew's well being in xxxxxx manned missions to the mars.  Not only does the packaging have to offer an effective means to preserve the food's nutrition and flavor over a long period of time, but the packaging material itself should be easily managed/recycled inside a confined environment like a space shuttle.    xxxxxxhough metal cans have long been used for long term food storage in daily life, trash management poses a serious problem for xxxxxx.  Recently, biodegradable polymers attracted a lot of attention as an environmentally friendly packaging material. xxxxxxver, they are mainly used for short shelf life products because of poor barrier properties.  To enhance its barrier protection properties to oxygen and water, in this xxxxxx project, we propose a new composite material of PLA coated with a thin layer of transparent and pin-hole free amorphous xxxxxx.  To improve PLA thermal properties and produce retorted polymer structures nanoparticles will be introduced in the polymer matrix. Moreover, to obtain the desired barrier properties for long shelf life food packaging a unique technique will be used to deposit xxxxxx films at substrate temperatures less than 80&#61616;C.  This effort will greatly enhance PLA's barrier properties to provide a unique high barrier packaging material with less mass and, more importantly, totally biodegradable.  This technology is easily scalable and a successful commercialization will definitely benefit xxxxxx manned missions.  Moreover, as an environmentally friendly packaging material, the technology has the potential to have a broad impact on society.	12536
VG2 NEP PLS DERIVED RDR ION OUTBND MAGSHTH M-MODE 12MIN V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	This data set gives the best available values for ion densities, temperatures, and velocities near xxxxxx derived from data obtained by the Voyager 2 plasma experiment. All parameters are obtained by fitting the observed spectra (current as a function of energy) with xxxxxxian plasma distributions, using a non-linear least squares fitting routine to find the plasma parameters which, when coupled with the full instrument response, best simulate the data. The PLS instrument measures energy/charge, so composition is not uniquely determined but can be deduced in some cases by the separation of the observed current peaks in energy (assuming the plasma is co-moving). In the upstream solar wind protons are fit to the M-long data since high energy resolution is needed to obtain accurate plasma parameters. In the magnetosheath the ion flux so low that several L-long spectra (3-5) had to be averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ratio to a level at which the data could be reliably fit. These averaged spectra were fit using 2 proton maxwellians with the same velocity. The values given in the upstream magnetosheath are the total density and the density-weighted temperature. In both the upstream solar wind and magnetosheath full vector velocities, densities and temperatures are derived for each fit component. In the magnetosphere spectra do not contain enough information to obtain full velocity vectors, so flow is assumed to be purely azimuthal. In some cases the azimuthal velocity is a fit parameter, in some cases rigid corotation is assumed. In the 'outer' magnetosphere (L>5) two distinct current peaks appear in the spectra H+ and N+. In the inner magnetosphere the plasma is hot and the composition is ambiguous, although two superimposed xxxxxxians are still required to fit the data. These spectra are fit using two compositions, one with H+ and N+ and the second with two H+ components. The N+ composition is preferred by the data provider. All fit values in the magnetosphere come with one sigma errors. It should be noted that no attempt has been made to account for the spacecraft potential, which is probably about -10 V in this region and will effect the density and velocity values. In the outbound magnetosheath and solar wind both moment and fit values are given for velocity, density, and thermal speed. The signal-to-noise ratio in the M-longs is very low, especially near the magnetopause, which can result in the analysis giving incorrect values. The L-long spectra have too low an energy resolution to permit accurate determinations parameters in many regions temperature and non-radial velocity components may be inaccurate.	12537
A Compact, Radiation Hardened, Stable, Low Power, Programmable Crystal Oscillator for Extreme Temperature and High Reliability Space Application, Phase II	2013-05-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxx (Div. of FMI, xxxxxx.) proposes to design, fabricate and deliver a conceptually proven, practical, and commercially available solution for a novel compact, radiation hardened, stable, low power, programmable crystal oscillator (RPXO), for high reliability space & extreme temperature applications. Our proposed device will be offered in a robust miniature 5x7mm industry standard surface mount package (0.24 grams only). We have engaged in the xxxxxx I study to further refine the approach with more confidence which concludes that the proposed solution would also offer compelling features such as scalable (wide) frequency range (100KHz to 250MHz), and dual output logic compatibility (CMOS & LVDS). The compelling features of our device features include drastically improved reliability and quicker availability. The overall design of the RPXO includes a radiation hardened SiGe ASIC that operates over the extreme temperature range of -230C to +150C and holds all the necessary functions of a crystal driver circuit, synthesizer, and output buffers. The ASIC uniquely provides dual output logic compatibility (CMOS and LVDS). All aspects of radiation hardness such as TID, ELDERS and SEU have been researched and addressed in the phase 1 study. The SiGe ASIC is integrated with a high reliability and radiation hardened crystal resonator in a highly compliant yet robust miniature package.	12538

Adaptive Automation for Anomaly Resolution, Phase I	2012-08-01	2018-07-19	As ground operations personnel and crew manage the operations of orbiting and exploration spacecraft, inevitably anomalies will arise. xxxxxxolving anomalies in real-time and preventing their future occurrence can be difficult.	12540
Real-Time Methods for Adaptive Suppression of Adverse Aeroservoelastic Dynamics, Phase II	2016-05-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx aeroservoelastic interaction is a problem on aircraft of all types causing repeated loading, enhanced fatigue, undesirable oscillations and catastrophic flutter. Traditionally, to suppress adverse aeroservoelastic interaction, notch and/or roll off filters are used in the primary flight control system architecture. This solution has pitfalls; rigid body performance is degraded due to resulting phase penalty and it is not robust to off nominal behavior. In xxxxxx I, an approach was developed that is entitled, Modal Isolation and Damping for xxxxxxive Aeroservoelastic Suppression (MIDAAS). This adaptive technique determines an optimal blend of multiple outputs that effectively isolates a problematic lightly damped mode and simultaneously determines an optimal blend of multiple inputs to suppress the problematic mode via feedback. xxxxxx effects on aircraft rigid body performance are minimized, resulting in virtually no phase penalty. MIDAAS was validated against aeroservoelastic F/A-18C aircraft models with varying stores configurations and demonstrated very successful performance. In the proposed xxxxxx program, a robust real-time adaptive aeroservoelastic suppression solution will be developed with a buildup approach that includes further MIDAAS enhancements, extensive validation studies utilizing a high-fidelity CFD-based aeroelastic model of the xxxxxx X-53 aircraft, and extensive validation studies utilizing real-time pilot in the loop simulation capability.	12541

Reactive Rendezvous and Docking Sequencer, Phase II	2013-05-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx poses some of the most challenging operational activities of any xxxxxx deep space mission. Rendezvous of a vehicle with a sample canister in order to return the canister to Earth requires a variety of complex mathematical processing on a changing data set, coupled with the need to safely and effectively handle a large range of off-nominal conditions and spacecraft faults. xxxxxx speed delay isolates the spacecraft from real-time operator intervention, while inertial and situational uncertainties demand reactivity not required of typical spacecraft sequencing systems. These mission features call for a new class of sequence capability: Reactive Rendezvous and xxxxxx Sequencer (xxxxxx  melds the rule-based reactivity needed for rendezvous and docking with sequence characteristics common to more traditional missions. xxxxxxs watch for conditions in order to react to the current situation, allowing a wide range of complex activities and safety-related responses to be concisely represented without complex procedural programming. xxxxxxponsibility for commanding elements aboard the spacecraft is divided among sequenced state machines called managers, coordinated together by a flight director which the ground commands.Underlying flight software for navigation, thruster allocation, inertial checking, attitude estimation and control, contact detection, docking mechanisms, and the like receive direction from the managers. This mediated control causes the system to reactively operate in modes with proper ordering of activities. Reactive operations are represented explicitly by states and transitions defining the managers, and do not require use of explicitly timed activities.xxxxxx of this xxxxxx will produce a Class B version of the underlaying VML 2.2 flight software capable of executing the RRDS state machines.

Accelerated Aging Experiments for Capacitor Health Monitoring and Prognostics	2013-04-12	2018-07-19	This paper discusses experimental setups for health monitoring and prognostics of electrolytic capacitors under nominal operation and accelerated aging conditions. xxxxxxlytic capacitors have higher failure rates than other components in electronic systems like power drives, power converters etc. Our current work focuses on developing first-principles-based degradation models for electrolytic capacitors under varying electrical and thermal stress conditions. Prognostics and health management for electronic systems aims to predict the onset of faults, study causes for system degradation, and accurately compute remaining useful life. Accelerated life test methods are often used in prognostics research as a way to model multiple causes and assess the effects of the degradation process through time. It also allows for the identification and study of different failure mechanisms and their relationships under different operating conditions. Experiments are designed for aging of the capacitors such that the degradation pattern induced by the aging can be monitored and analyzed. Experimental setups and data collection methods are presented to demonstrate this approach.	12556

Physics-Based Aeroanalysis Methods for Open Rotor Conceptual Design, Phase II	2018-04-01	2018-07-19	Operating costs and fossil fuel consumption of civil transports can be reduced through use of efficient counter rotating open rotor (CROR) propulsion systems, thereby addressing both key industry needs and long-term xxxxxx technical goals.  To develop such next-generation systems, multiple design variables must be assessed efficiently within a conceptual design software environment.

FDM-HAWK, A High Performance Compact Modular Solar Array, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxing a next generation high performance solar array withsignificant reduction in size and weight will result in improved xxxxxxmission capabilities at lower cost.  xxxxxx cell technology isevolving rapidly to the point solar array structural and mechanicalsystems do not fully optimize system level mass and volume performancepotential.  MMA Design LLC (MMA) proposes to develop a compactdeployable modular solar array concept with next generation cost andperformance improvements.  A solar array is proposed that ismechanically simple while meeting the support requirements of currentlyavailable solar cells, as well as future higher performance cells.  Thesolar array decreases production and system costs through modularity andsimplicity, increases the power to stowed volume ratio (W/m3), andincreases specific power (W/kg), thus exceeding the performance of theexisting state-of-the-art (SOA) systems.

Surface Passivation of Lithium-Ion Electrodes: A Path to High-Performance Energy Storage	2016-08-01	2018-07-19	Energy storage is one of the most crucial aspects of space technology. Whether the energy is stored as fuel in the solid rocket boosters or as electrochemical energy in the onboard batteries, the need for on-demand power is essential. Some functions of spacecraft such as life-support and lighting require continuous electrical energy, but a large majority of other functions such as communications, guidance, and control electronics only require it intermittently. This places a widely varying electrical load on the power systems of the spacecraft that in some cases cannot be handled directly by the constant energy output of solar or thermoelectric power generation systems. In these cases the electrical power is supplied as needed in part or wholly from rechargeable battery banks. These batteries must have a long cycle life, high energy density and high power density to meet the rigorous demands of spacecraft avionics. In addition they also have to be light-weight, compact and able to withstand extreme operating conditions; a consideration for every component sent into space. The importance of secondary battery systems in spacecraft and space exploration equipment cannot be overstated, making them a vital space technology. Of the currently available rechargeable battery technologies, lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries have the best combination of high specific energy density, high volumetric energy density and acceptable cycle life. xxxxxxver, current li-ion technology has cost, toxicity, and high temperature cyclability issues.This project seeks to overcome the deficiencies of current li-ion battery technology and meet the electrical energy requirements for long-duration space missions through the development of a high-performance li-ion cathode based on the lithium nickel manganese spinel (xxxxxx or LNM). LNM has advantages of low-cost and low-toxicity over current li-ion technology because it does not use cobalt, an expensive and toxic element. Also, LNM has higher specific energy density and power density over current layered lithium cobalt oxide cathodes because of its higher operating voltage and increased capacity. xxxxxxver, LNM does suffer from unfavorable cyclability at elevated temperatures due to increased reactivity with the electrolyte, a problem that can be mitigated or solved through surface passivation. Doping the material with foreign elements and processing the cathodes under sufficient synthesis conditions can lead to surface passivation through reorganization of the surface structure. This renders the surface kinetically stable upon cycling by creating a stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer which protects the electrolyte from further oxidation/reduction. The exact mechanism of surface passivation of LNM by doping and its connection to surface restructuring is not known. The goals of this project are to identify the surface passivation mechanism of the doping method in the LNM system and its connection to surface restructuring and use that knowledge to optimize composition and synthesis conditions to improve cyclability of LNM. xxxxxxanced electron microscopy techniques such as aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) combined with traditional analysis techniques such as x-ray diffraction (xxxxxx) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) will be employed to analyze surface/bulk compositions and structures of the material with different dopants processed under varying processing conditions. The knowledge gained from these experiments will lead to a next-generation li-ion battery with superior energy storage and cycling capabilities that is robust enough to endure the extreme conditions of space duty. This represents an innovative and important scientific contribution to xxxxxxs space technology and more broadly, the many technologies that can benefit from portable, high performance electrical energy storage.	12569
Machine Learning of Multi-Modal Influences on Airport Delays, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	We build machine learning capabilities that enables improved prediction of off-block times and wheels up times which are critical inputs to NAS stakeholders.  xxxxxx will rely on machine learning techniques utilizing all sources of useful information in order to improve predictive accuracy and reliability of flight operations in the NAS.  These predictive capabilities will support real-time optimization of surface operations. We use machine learning to learn from historical data and similar situations in the past in order to optimize the performance of the NAS for the current situation.  The proposed xxxxxx-xxxxxx, xxxxxx-xxxxxx (MLMV) machine learning approach takes real-time weather, demand, and other data inputs (including landside data from TSA security line queues and traffic congestion levels on highways), searches through an archived set of historical data, identifies similar situations and NAS controls used in those situations, ranks historical situations according to their effectiveness, estimates a set of Traffic Management Initiatives (TMIs) and other control strategies impacting off-block-times and wheels up times.	12570
Environmental and facility conditions promote singular gravity responses of transcriptome during Drosophila metamorphosis	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	Genome-wide transcriptional profiling showed that reducing gravity levels in xxxxxx (xxxxxx) causes important alterations in xxxxxx gene expression intimately linked to imposed spaceflight-related environmental constrains during xxxxxx metamorphosis. xxxxxxver simulation experiments on ground testing space-related environmental constraints show differential responses. Curiously although particular genes are not common in the different experiments the same GO groups including a large multigene family related with behavior stress response and organogenesis are over represented in them. A global and integrative analysis using the gene expression dynamics inspector (xxxxxxI) self-organizing maps reveals different degrees in the responses of the transcriptome when using different environmental conditions or microgravity/hypergravity simulation devices. These results suggest that the transcriptome is finely tuned to normal gravity. In regular environmental conditions the alteration of this constant parameter on Earth can have mild effects on gene expression but when environmental conditions are far from optimal the gene expression is much more intense and consistent effects.	12571

Automated Break-Out Box for use with Low Cost Spacecraft Integration and Test, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	Electrical checkout and testing is a critical part of the overall spacecraft integration and test flow.  xxxxxxing proper harness and connector signal interfaces is key to ensuring component health and overall system functionality.  Break-Out Boxes (BOB) are used to give test personnel access to electrical signals for probing, voltage injection, isolation checks, safe-to-mate checks, and voltage/current measurements.  Currently this involves manually attaching multimeters and oscilloscopes to banana jacks on the BOB, taking measurements and comparing to expected results.        xxxxxx proposes designing an automated break-out box to make electrical integration activities more efficient, repeatable, and safe by introducing software controlled test sequences and reducing human errors.  Additionally, significant schedule and cost reductions are realized by improving the speed and reliability of integration operations.  Our software controlled BOB would allow isolation and safe-to-mate checks to be accomplished in a fraction of the time required for a human operator.  xxxxxxtage and current measurements would be analyzed in the software for pass/fail criteria and reported to the user for inclusion in the test log.  Automating test sequences through the use of an automated BOB has the potential to significantly streamline spacecraft, payload and launch site electrical integration and test activities.	12574

We believe these methods can be reconfigured to use for spaceflight operations.  These completely unobtrusive measures of cognitive load can be part of an overall workload assessment assay and are compatible with both team and individually performed tasks.  Within xxxxxx I, we will conduct an extensive literature review of the current state of the art in automated detectors, focusing on unobtrusive methods that can detect dimensions proven scientifically to predict workload.  This review will reveal evidence-based features that show the most promise as both behavioral indicators of workload and as objective measurements that are amendable to machine learning and statistical techniques. The results of this review will serve as a risk reduction exercise to evaluate and down-select a set of workload detection methods that warrant further investigation.  We will then use the set of candidate metrics, along with our own prior work with semantic analysis and keystroke dynamics to design machine learning algorithms, ultimately producing a workload sensor tailored for use with long duration mission relevant tasks.  xxxxxx I will include an exploratory investigation of a candidate measures, initial sensor designs, and produce experimental plans and IRB protocols for the overall system validation using a combination of data gathered from laboratory settings and ground-based analogs such as the Human Exploration xxxxxxearch xxxxxx (HERA) at JSC, the UTMB Bedrest facility, and the xxxxxx Simulation (HISEAS). xxxxxx will focus on engineering efforts to implement the sensor algorithms, the support tools for the experiment, conducting the validation study, and data analysis.	12575

The LES/FW-H model will be simultaneously validated against matched sets of flowfield and companion acoustic data acquired recently at xxxxxx/GRC for round nozzles.

Lunar Spectral Irradiance Monitor, Phase II	2019-07-01	2018-07-19	The purpose of this effort is to develop an instrument to accurately calibrate (1% k=2) the lunar spectral reflectance (350 to 2,300 nm) at relatively low expense from a small satellite. Assuming the TSIS missions are successful and the solar irradiance is known, the lunar spectral reflectance can be used to provide known lunar irradiance, thereby providing a stable exo-atmospheric calibration source for earth-viewing instruments on low earth orbit satellites. The proposed instrument has been designed specifically for calibrating the lunar irradiance. It is compact, simple in concept, and the data product is nearly immune to long-term degradation because it collects solar and lunar signals using the same optics in the same way.

WindBots: persistent in-situ science explorers for gas giants	2016-06-01	2018-07-19	We envision persistent exploration of the gas giants with robots powered by locally harvested energy, performing in-situ observational atmospheric science. Riding strong, turbulent windstorms of the troposphere, WindBots (WBs) tumble and are bumped around. Real-time control is used to adjust body shape/surface asymmetries for controlled aerodynamic forces, changing direction or lift. Autorotation and mechanisms similar to those used in kinetic/automatic watches are used to harvest wind energy. They obtain electric power via electromagnetic generators. They can also deploy retractable electrodynamic tethers to harvest the planetary magnetic field.	12582
Towards Prognostics of Power MOSFETs: Accelerated Aging and Precursors of Failure	2013-05-09	2018-07-19	This paper presents research results dealing with power MOSFETs (metal oxide semiconductor field effect tran- sistor) within the prognostics and health management of electronics. Experimental results are presented for the identification of the on-resistance as a precursor to failure of devices with die-attach degradation as a failure mechanism. Devices are aged under power cycling in order to trigger die-attach damage. In situ measurements of key electrical and thermal parameters are collected throughout the aging process and further used for analysis and computation of the on-resistance parameter. Experimental results show that the devices experience die-attach damage and that the on-resistance captures the degradation process in such a way that it could be used for the development of prognostics algorithms (data-driven or physics-based).	12583

Reliable Actuator for Cryo Propellant Fluid Control, Phase II	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	Fluid handling applications in cryogenic and extreme environments require reliable actuation technology that can handle extreme temperatures, mechanical bind-up from ice and foreign contaminants, and operation in poor conditions.  A novel EM hammer drive technology is proposed for use in cryo-propellant fuel storage and regulation valves/devices.  In addition to high force, the new drive technology offers potential advantages for miniaturization, heat load reduction, and lower cost than traditional electromagnetic and piezoelectric actuators.  xxxxxx and Materials (xxxxxx) proposes to focus the xxxxxx innovation on the development of a hammer drive actuation mechanism that will take the EM oscillatory power and produce continuous linear motion for operation at cryogenic and extreme environments.  xxxxxx has demonstrated expertise in the operation of its high force linear motor actuators at temperatures down to 77 K.  The proposed actuator should operate from approximately 4 K to 400 K and should provide very low or no out gassing as well as operational capabilities in hard vacuum. The technology is proposed for applications in the cryo fluid management, pressure and flow control, and driving operational equipment and instruments. This proposal addresses xxxxxx's approach to the development of flight-scalable demonstration components for the EM hammer drive technology.	12585
Thermodynamically Consistent Electrochemical Models for Accelerating Development and Qualification of Power Generation and Storage Systems, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	Industry and other government agencies are advancing battery, fuel cell, and electrolyzer technology to reduce costs and increase specific power.  xxxxxxver, xxxxxx unique missions with extreme conditions and difficulty in replacing batteries require even greater specific power improvements in conjunction with long life and performance at extremely high or low temperatures.  xxxxxx models, incorporating the thermodynamics and electrochemistry that dictates device performance and degradation, are needed to accelerate development and insertion of these systems.  To provide this capability, CFDRC and our collaborator Dr. xxxxxx, TAMU, will develop and validate detailed models that link chemical composition and elementary reaction steps with the properties and reactions of electrochemical system constituents.  The proposed electrochemical models will be based on fundamental chemical and electrochemical properties of the materials, as opposed to empirical fits of observed properties for a specific battery electrode material and electrolyte mixture or fuel cell catalyst, support, and electrolyte combination.  A property database and software library will be used and extended, allowing application of the developed models in performance simulators of xxxxxx preference.  The ability of the developed models to incorporate detailed thermodynamics and electrochemical kinetics of degradation processes will be demonstrated during xxxxxx I, with extension to additional materials and validation during xxxxxx.  The resulting models will significantly reduce the need for iterative, trial-and-error tests of new materials to accelerate development and increase confidence in projected device lifetimes.	12586

Assessing the Feasibility of Using Co-electrolysis to Concurrently Convert Carbon Dioxide and Water into Methane and Oxygen for Propellant and Life Support on Mars	2020-08-01	2018-07-19	By using co-electrolysis with task-specific ionic liquids (TSILs), water from xxxxxx regolith and carbon dioxide from the xxxxxx atmosphere may be simultaneously electrolyzed in an electrochemical cell, producing methane and oxygen in a single process vessel. The following objectives and methods will be undertaken to advance the technology for future crewed missions to xxxxxx. xxxxxx will identify candidate TSILs and electrodes for the cathode compartment of the electrochemical cell. To achieve this, a literature review of potential ionic liquids and cathode materials will be performed in order to identify those suitable for this technology. The next step will be to experimentally verify that they possess desirable characteristics and address knowledge gaps from the literature review. xxxxxx 2 will then evaluate TSILs and electrodes from xxxxxx by characterizing their reaction kinetics, adsorbed species, and intermediates. Rotating disk and rotating ring-disk electrode experiments will be used to study the reduction process of carbon dioxide to methane. The results of these tests will be collectively analyzed to identify and select cathodes and TSILs most conducive to methane production. xxxxxx 3 will focus on designing and fabricating a benchtop-scale electrochemical cell in order to enable the evaluation of selected cathodes and TSILs in a laboratory environment. xxxxxx 4 will characterize the performance of the electrochemical cell with each TSIL and electrode over a range of operating conditions. Candidate components selected at the conclusion of xxxxxx 2 will be integrated into the test article from xxxxxx 3 to parametrically assess the technology on a bench-top scale. The goal is to prove that methane can be selectively produced in relevant operational environments. xxxxxx 5 will assess integrated system-level parameters. The specifications of promising test units, including methane and oxygen production rates, mass, volume and power, will be extrapolated to relevant scales for human spaceflight to enable comparison to functionally similar systems.This research effort is aimed at advancing the technology readiness level of co-electrolysis with TSILs from 2 to 4 by proving the concept of the technology and validating a low-fidelity cell. This will position the technology for further refinement and integration into xxxxxx xxxxxxource Utilization (ISRU) systems. If an ionic liquid can be identified and implemented in a properly designed electrochemical cell, co-electrolysis should reduce the cost, complexity and risk of crewed xxxxxx missions by simplifying oxygen and methane production to a single chemical step. In fact, an ISRU architecture with this technology would require fewer major processes and components, approximately 50% less mass, and 25% less power than the conventional xxxxxxxxwater electrolysis paradigm for propellant and oxygen production. Acknowledging these advantages and the potential for the technology, xxxxxx calls for the development of co-electrolysis with TSILs in its roadmap for Human Exploration Destination xxxxxxs.	12590

Unlike competing deposition technologies severely limited by substrate size and dimensions, xxxxxxSonic's rare earth silicate coatings may be spray deposited under ambient conditions onto large area complex substrates and converted to mechanically robust, thermally insulative EBCs on a production basis.  In fact, legacy spray equipment employed for hardcoat deposition within the marine, automotive and aerospace industries has been used for successful EBC deposition. Simulated NTP testing completed by the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx on coated xxxxxxonel 625 substrates indicate five candidate EBCs have exceptional environmental, dimensional, and adhesive durability within flow conditions representative of NTP rocket engines. In fact, zero spallation, erosion, or any other form of coating degradation was observed at the thermal limit of testing of 1,950 C. All candidate resins may be transitioned to 200-gallon batch production quantities within an established manufacturing infrastructure.	12593
Europa Drum Sampler (EDuS), Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	The main objective of the proposed work is to develop a robust and effective sample acquisition system for the xxxxxx lander called the xxxxxx xxxxxx (EDuS).  The proposed drum sampling system is based on a terrestrial roadheader design and includes a Thwacker that generates percussive vibrations during rotary excavation.  All components will be designed to withstand xxxxxx Heat xxxxxxbial Reduction as well as xxxxxx Protection requirements.  The EDuS' structural components include a support boom, a buffer plate, and a cutter head.  The support boom is hollow and its position and length can be adjusted depending on the required excavation depth and volume on the lander.  For launch, the boom will be compressed and then spring-extended upon landing.  A spring loaded boom has an added advantage of mitigating Thwacker vibrations to the Robotic Arm.  The buffer plate is also a structural member whose main purpose is to prevent chips from falling out.  The cuter head is the central part of the system.  The cutter head has been designed in the shape of a typical cylindrical pressure vessel.  The teeth are placed on all rotating surfaces, including the convex sides. This shape can deal with a range of surface topographies from flat to very jagged.  The teeth are very sharp to reduce cutting forces and are made of carbide to increase longevity.  The cutter head also includes a ring of teeth which make up the Thwacker Ratchet.  Thwacking will reduce cutting forces and aid in sample delivery.	12594

UAVs can be flown in xxxxxx xxxxxx (NAS) today, but only with special permission from the FAA -- a process that often takes 60 to 90 days. Moreover, permission is often contingent on heavy restrictions, such as accompanying the UAV with a manned chase plane, thereby nullifying the cost savings of a UAV. Full fruition of UAV technology will require incorporation of UAVs into mainstream air traffic management (xxxxxx) practices, including traffic flow management flow control programs and possible creation of special use airspace (SUA). In this xxxxxx, we propose a UAV-to-traffic flow management (UAV-TFM) interface. This allows traffic managers to anticipate and track UAVs.

This sensor, similar to that of the successful xxxxxx's  Terminal xxxxxx xxxxxx  (MSL-TDS) will 1) expand the  range of operation over that of the MSL-TDS and 2) mitigate  identified risks due to dust and anomalously low backscatter areas.  We will achieve this in part by establishing a xxxxxx TDS design.  In xxxxxx we will explore compact multi-beam shared aperture antenna designs and system trades to minimize antenna aperture size.  In addition, the design approach for the system back-end electronics will be modular, compact, reproducible, and highly versatile.  Utilizing RSS' novel, modular reconfigurable digital subsystem will enable us to produce reconfigurable architectures and pulse-timing/geometry.  Such a solution is independent of the eventual transmit frequency of operation.  As such, xxxxxx or even W-band sensors could be produced based on this design for landing scenarios where velocity accuracy or size is a premium, and dust or airborne particulates are not a concern.The xxxxxx will establish a design that not only meets the stated MSL-TDS requirements but exceeds them in terms of sensitivity and range of altitudes of operation.

There is no mechanism for the aircraft to autonomously return to a safe landing zone under these conditions. Furthermore, experience has shown that existing controllers are not good at detecting bad position data caused by intermittent GPxxxxxxse conditions are known to cause flyaways.  The only existing protection is the operator. There is currently no automation that can protect an SUAS when the flight controller is unable to recognize that the GPS and comm links are unreliable.A unique feature of the invention is a dual onboard flight controller. One is a failsafe controller, and the other is experimental. The failsafe controller allows access to control outputs by the experimental controller. Meanwhile, it detects conditions such as lack of GPS reliability, imminent airspace violations, flight profile violations, imminent loss-of-control, and loss-of-stability by experimental software. If the failsafe controller detects one or more of these conditions, then it autonomously seizes control authority from the experimental flight controller and navigates the aircraft to a pre-determined recovery spot, using visual navigation if necessary. No comm link is required.	12610
Solid Oxide Fuel Cell/Turbine Hybrid Power System for Advanced Aero-propulsion and Power, Phase I	2005-01-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx oxide fuel cell (SOFC)/ gas turbine hybrid power systems (HPSs) have been recognized by federal agencies and other entities as having the potential to operate at unprecedented levels of performance for terrestrial applications (e.g., 70% power generation efficiencies with significantly mitigated criteria pollutant and noise emissions).

High-Strain Composite Deployable Radiators for CubeSats, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	In response to xxxxxx need for compact, lightweight and efficient, low-cost deployable radiators for xxxxxx, xxxxxx proposes to develop a high-strain laminate composite deployable radiator capable of dissipating over 50-watts of thermal energy. The proposed design leverages xxxxxx's experience in high-strain composite deployable structures and thermal management products for CubeSat and SmallSat applications. While solar arrays and instrument capabilities in CubeSat applications keep growing, the limited radiator surface results in a thermal bottleneck that limits the actual use of science or communication instruments.

Correlation Radiometer ASIC, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	The proposed project aims to develop an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for the xxxxxx microwave correlation radiometers required for space and airborne Earth sensing applications. The radiometer instrumentation installed on xxxxxx and SmallSats is required to have small volume, low weight and consume low power. Currently used correlating radiometers rely on analog signal processing, thus are bulky, power hungry and cannot be reprogrammed. xxxxxx filter parameters tend to be unstable over temperature, power supply voltage, may degrade over time and need tuning.The proposed low-power, rad-hard ASIC will operate with microwave correlation radiometer front ends down-converting the RF to up to 10GHz IF quadrature signals. The ASIC will include digitizers, bandpass filters, cross-correlators, totalizers, serializers, an output data interface and an I2C interface for the ASIC's programming. Bandpass filters will split up the digitized quadrature IF input signals into bands (up to 16), will cross-correlate the signals within each band and will ship out the resultant data in a convenient format. Instead of analog signal processing performing a strictly defined function, the ASIC will employ a digital signal processing which can be reprogrammed to adopt specific parameters of the filter block such as the number of bands, each filter's corner frequency, bandwidth and filter's order. A number of innovations will be introduced to the ASIC in order to combine programmability, low power consumption and radiation tolerance. The project's xxxxxx I will provide the proof of feasibility of implementing the proposed ASIC. xxxxxx will include finishing the design, chip fabrication, testing and delivering the ADC prototypes which will be ready for commercialization in xxxxxx.	12614

Monolithic Compliant Space Mechanisms Design Strategies	2017-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx additive manufacturing technologies such as Direct Metal xxxxxx Sintering and xxxxxxn Beam xxxxxxing now allow 3D printing of complex geometries. These processes build up a part layer by layer, instead of removing material from a large block as in traditional machining. Such processes are ideal for low quantity production. Using these technologies, assemblies can be simplified to one part in a monolithic (made from a single solid piece) design. xxxxxx of monolithic designs include simplicity, robustness, and lower cost.Compliant mechanisms derive their motion from the flexing of constituent members. This eliminates sliding contact in bearings and joints, which can greatly increase reliability, especially in space. Because compliant mechanisms do not rely on assembled joints, they are ideally suited to monolithic designs.Combining additive manufacturing techniques with compliant mechanism technology has the potential to greatly increase performance and reduce costs in space technology applications. Compliant mechanisms are often designed to be monolithic, and using 3D additive machining processes is a natural step in the development of compliant mechanism technology.xxxxxxing compliant mechanism design strategies for monolithic space technology carries some unique challenges that must be addressed in order to take full advantage of the technology. In the context of additive manufacturing techniques, I will address two major challenges: vibration characteristics and large strain energy.Because compliant mechanisms are flexible, they often have low natural frequencies, making them subject to undesirable vibrations. By employing the pseudo-rigid-body model of complaint mechanisms in conjunction with finite element analysis, I believe we can find ways to optimize compliant space mechanisms for high natural frequencies without compromising the needed flexibility.As compliant mechanisms are actuated they act as springs, storing energy as the flexible members deflect. This results in a need for larger input forces to overcome the mechanism's internal stiffness. Large actuators add mass, complexity, and increased power consumption. xxxxxx balancing has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing the force required to actuate compliant mechanisms. Usually static balancing strategies require some assembly step to introduce a pre-load that compensates for energy added during actuation. Think of an architect's lamp and how the springs compensate for the weight of the lamp. Now realize that all those springs and links add complexity and expense. Finding strategies for pre-load introduction without departing from monolithic fabrication will be a major part of ensuring the feasibility of this technology. By exploiting compliant mechanisms in monolithic designs, we can eliminate much of that complexity.By developing design guidelines that adapt compliant mechanisms to the needs of space technology I hope to take advantage of new advances in additive metal manufacturing to achieve unprecedented performance and longer life. This research will directly impact xxxxxx 12.3 (Mechanical xxxxxxs), but TA13.3 (xxxxxxreased Reliability) and xxxxxx (Robot Manipulation) will also benefit.	12616

The manufacturing process for SCCM integrates Trex's patented CVC xxxxxx process technology with ITT's corrugated mirror design.  The former technology CVC xxxxxx has been shown to yield an excellent, highly mechanically and thermally stable mirror substrate material, while the latter corrugated mirror concept has been utilized to rapidly and inexpensively fabricate glass mirrors.  The SCCM process forms a hollow, closed back corrugated mirror blank by sequentially depositing thin (1-3mm thick) CVC xxxxxx layers onto appropriately designed sacrificial graphite mandrels, which are removed subsequently by burnout in an oxidizing high temperature furnace.  Nominally, the hollow SCCM then consists of mirror facesheet layer, a corrugated interior layer and a backsheet layer, each intimately chemically bonded with each other by the CVC xxxxxx layer-on-layer deposition process.  The result is a monolithic, highly stiff, mechanically and thermally stable mirror substrate suitable for visible, UV, EUV, x-ray and infrared telescopes.  Furthermore, because of the unique fabrication process, minimal after deposition grinding is required, resulting in a cost-effective, rapid deposition process.	12618
Advanced Filtering Techniques Applied to Spaceflight, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx need accurate position and velocity estimates in order to control their orbits.  Some missions require more accurate estimates than others, but nearly all missions need some type of orbit determination.   IST-Rolla seeks to provide highly accurate algorithms that do not overpower the spacecraft's computer.Many new, powerful algorithms exist such as the particle filter and the unscented xxxxxx filter, but most of them involve integrating several state vectors, and those integrations devour the computing power available.  IST-Rolla will implement the è-D technique, the cost based filter (CBF), and the neural network estimator for orbit determination(developed by IST-Rolla xxxxxxs) and analyze the results.  These filters are nonlinear and might provide better accuracy than the extended xxxxxx filter (EKF) which is widely used, without being computationally cumbersome as the particle filter and unscented xxxxxx filter.The theta-D technique approximates the solution to the filter-related Ricatti Equation.  The CBF is an attempt to formulation of the filter under an 'optimal' framework. The neural network estimator works to estimate the modeling errors online so that the estimates become more accurate.	12619
Machine-learning & QMU for multi-fidelity analysis of scramjet operability, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx-mode scramjets have the potential to operate efficiently in a variety of flight conditions without requiring complicated variable configurations, thus providing cost-effective access to space and potential for high-speed atmospheric transport. xxxxxxver, the successful design and operation of these systems requires the identification of potential failure modes related to the transition between ramjet and scramjet modes and inlet-isolator-combustor unstart events. High-fidelity computer simulations and detailed diagnostics in a ground-based facility provide invaluable data, but cannot be routinely used for an extensive exploration of design solutions due to cost. Furthermore, it is challenging to formulate efficient design strategies that accommodate performance constraints and guarantee safe operations; as a consequence safety factors (and limitations in vehicle operability) are typically introduced a-posteriori leading to suboptimal systems. Cascade's proposal aims at investigating modern scramjet systems using a combination of computational tools focusing on design strategies that a-priori include safety margins from unstart. The project goal is to combine machine-learning tools, in-house high-fidelity simulation capabilities, and high-throughput low fidelity engineering techniques within a risk-aware optimization framework that can potentially enhance the ability to generate safe and performant design. xxxxxx learning will enable the extraction and categorization of knowledge from in-house high-fidelity data and experiments; the engineering tools afford the exploration of a large set of geometrical configurations and operating scenarios; the QMU (Quantification of Margins and xxxxxx) technique, will provide the optimization framework. xxxxxx of the high-fidelity and low-fidelity tools with data from the HIFiRE experimental campaign will provide an explicit measure of the confidence in the simulations which will explicitly be included within QMU.	12620
Novel High Pressure Pump-on-a-Chip Technology, Phase II	2016-01-01	2018-07-19	"HJ xxxxxx & xxxxxx, xxxxxx. proposes to develop a novel high pressure \"pump-on-a-chip\" (HPPOC) technology capable of generating high pressure and flow rate on the microchip level.  When combined with a \"valve-on-a-chip\" (VOC) platform, HPPOC is naturally suited for xxxxxx planetary science applications including on-chip HPLC sample manipulation and analysis.  In xxxxxx I, we have established the technical feasibility of the technology by fabricating a set of HPPOC chips and successfully demonstrating the required maximum pressures and flow rates.  In addition, we have also established a novel HPPOC actuated VOC platform.  In xxxxxx, we will construct, test, and deliver a high performance and low power consumption microfluidic sample manipulation manifold prototype.  In particular, we will build an integrated on-chip HPLC buffer and sample injection pump and valve manifold specifically engineered to support the chip-based LC-MS research effort at GSFC.  In addition, the xxxxxx work will also be performed in parallel with efforts to develop such manifolds for the commercial analytical markets."	12621
In-Flight Microbial Monitor	2014-06-01	2018-07-19	Previous research has shown that potential human pathogens have been detected on xxxxxx (xxxxxx). &nbsp;xxxxxx microorganisms are introduced with every exchange of crew and cargo. &nbsp;xxxxxx introduced to the xxxxxx are readily transferred between crew and subsystems (i.e., ECLSS, environmental control and life support systems). &nbsp;Current microbial characterization methods require a culture-based enrichment of microorganisms and at least a 48-hour incubation time. This increases the microbial load while detecting only a limited number of microorganisms. The culture-based method detects approximately 1-10% of the total organisms present and provides no identification. To identify and enumerate xxxxxx samples requires that the microbes be returned to Earth for complete analysis. Therefore, a more expedient, low-cost, in-flight method of microbial detection, identification, and enumeration is needed. The RAZOR EX, a ruggedized, commercial off the shelf, real-time PCR field instrument was tested for its ability to detect microorganisms at low concentrations within one hour. Escherichia coli, xxxxxx enterica Typhimurium, and xxxxxx aeruginosa were detected at low levels using real-time DNA amplification. Total heterotrophic counts could also be detected using a 16S gene marker that can identify up to 98% of all bacteria. To reflect viable cells found in the samples, xxxxxx was also detectable using a modified, single-step reverse transcription reaction. Previous research has shown that potential human pathogens have been detected on xxxxxx (xxxxxx). xxxxxx microorganisms are introduced with every exchange of crew and cargo making it necessary to monitor the water, air, and surfaces to identify microbial contamination and prevent adverse effects on crew health and environmental control systems (xxxxxx, 2012).&nbsp; xxxxxx introduced to the xxxxxx are readily transferred between crew and subsystems (i.e., ECLSS, environmental control and life support systems). Current microbial characterization methods are time consuming, requiring enrichment of microorganisms thereby increasing the microbial load. This method can detect only a limited number of microorganisms and therefore is an incomplete picture. To identify and enumerate xxxxxx samples requires that samples to be returned to Earth for complete analysis. Neither route would be feasible for long duration space flight especially beyond low Earth orbit. Therefore, a more expedient, low-cost, in-flight method of microbial detection, identification, and enumeration is warranted.Many subsystems on the xxxxxx have been negatively impacted by microbial biofouling. In 2011, microbiologists and other subject matter specialists recommended implementing molecular-based technologies, such as real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), to evaluate if qPCR could replace current culture-based technologies. The following year, in 2012, the xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Mission Directorate Game xxxxxxing xxxxxx Program initiated a project to identify current platforms capable of microbial monitoring in microgravity. xxxxxxs capable of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were selected and evaluated. PCR is a method designed to take a small amount of genetic material (DNA) from cells and amplify it using optimized PCR reagents. Within a short period of time, one copy of the cellular DNA is amplified to billions of copies without the need to cultivate the microorganisms (xxxxxxure 1). If successful, it would provide a fast, reliable monitoring technology, enabling operational decisions for the xxxxxx and for future long-duration spaceflight missions.The goal of this study was to describe and test the capabilities of a potential microbial monitoring system that will identify and provide relative abundance information for commonly recovered microorganisms previously sampled aboard the ISxxxxxx RAZOR EX&reg; (xxxxxxfire Defense, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, UT) is a compact, lightweight, ruggedized, automated, rapid, PCR instrument capable of providing rapid microbial identification and relative enumeration. Designed to readily detect microorganisms on the battlefield, the instrument is easily operated by untrained crew members and can provide real-time data for air, water, surface, and biomedical samples (xxxxxxure 2).Additional goals included the development and testing of species-specific assays for detection of target organisms; testing to confirm the lowest level of detection for the RAZOR polymerase chain reaction instrument for targeted organisms; and determining the effects of media, solutions and complex matrices on the detection of microorganisms. xxxxxxs were also tested to determine if communities of microorganisms would interfere with the detection of each individual type of microorganism through competition, and whether total heterotrophic counts of microorganisms could be performed to provide cellular enumeration data. Ultimately, these combined data would be presented to down-select a COTS platform suitable for microbial monitoring aboard xxxxxx. Once the above goals were completed, the RAZOR was then applied to additional programs (i.e., Food Safety) to assess its functionality.	12622
An Airborne Particulate Monitor for Spacecraft, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	Currently there are no tools to monitor the size or concentration of nanometer to submicrometer particles aboard spacecraft cabins. Yet there are many sources aboard the spacecraft known to generate particles in this ultrafine size range. Our technology provides a means to make this measurement in a compact, low power, unit that may be made suitable for spacecraft. With a newly developed, self-sustaining water-based condensation particle technology, particles from the nanometer to micrometer size range are enlarged through water condensation and counted optically. Yet, unlike other condensation-based counters, our unit recovers all of the evaporated water within the wick itself.  It needs no water reservoirs, and can be operated in any orientation. All water transport is by capillary action, and gravity is not needed. Coupled with a size selection device it can provide data on mean particle size. Measurable concentrations are from 1 to 1 million particles per cubic centimeter. We aim to adapt our existing technology to the long-term, zero-gravity, robust monitoring needed by xxxxxx. Specific objectives are to verify a prototype self-sustaining condensation particle counting system that can be operated in any orientation; that can detect and count individual particles from 10 to 2000 nm; that contains the controls and on-board diagnostics to ensure long-term performance; and whose critical components are compatible with an ultimate package weighing less than 2 kg, and requiring less than 4 watts of power.	12623
Multi Satellite Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Trajectory Coordination	2021-08-01	2018-07-19	"The objective of this project is to develop a framework to optimize the coordination of multiple spacecraft, each with defined goals. Using this framework, optimal trajectories can be created for multiple spacecraft to optimize either common or opposing objectives. These objectives can be arbitrary, and applications to cooperative mission objectives such as rendezvous and science objectives such as planetary flyover will specifically be investigated. xxxxxximal trajectories in non-cooperative cases (e.g. one spacecraft \"chasing\" another) will also be investigated because of the applicability to spacecraft impact mitigation and debris avoidance. The general optimization framework will subsequently be used to investigate autonomous cooperation of multiple spacecraft where the optimization is performed online and information is shared between the spacecraft. This includes exploring the degree of information sharing needed for multiple spacecraft to optimize mission goals such as autonomous rendezvous. Autonomous operations can relieve the bottleneck of ground communication and enable the completion of many more mission objectives.The first steps towards investigating spacecraft cooperation and non-cooperation will be using reachable sets that have been previously developed for single spacecraft. Given the reachable space (in orbit element space) of each spacecraft for a certain available delta V, the intersection point of the spaces presents an optimized rendezvous location for low delta V. This same idea can be extended to the non-cooperative pursuit/evasion case where an evading spacecraft calculates the pursuing spacecraft's reachable space and finds the farthest point on that space that it is able to reach. This limited investigation will then be generalized using the framework of differential game theory, which is essentially the \"many player\" equivalent of optimal control theory. The generalization will first be to the pursuit/evasion formulation of a differential game. This will allow direct comparison to the reachable set methods and is a stepping stone towards the more generalized differential game formulation that is more flexible in handling various mission goals. The general differential game framework will allow the optimization of arbitrary criteria to meet mission goals beyond what can be calculated using reachable sets and the pursuit/evasion game. This allows the calculation of optimal trajectories for multiple spacecraft to achieve specified goals. The general differential game formulation also enables the investigation of information sharing needed for successful cooperation.The implications of this project are far reaching and becoming increasingly significant. xxxxxx missions are becoming more complex, with greater reliance on successful coordination of multiple in-orbit assets in order to achieve more complex mission goals. As more ambitious missions make use of multiple spacecraft, optimizing overall coordination of the spacecraft will become more important to reducing cost and increasing chances of mission success. xxxxxx Asteroid Redirect Mission takes advantage of the greater flexibility by using separate robotic and human elements that will rendezvous near the xxxxxx. Similarly, future manned xxxxxx missions may require the rendezvous of multiple assets sent to the planet beforehand. There are also discussions about using groups of SmallSats to map asteroids. The coordination capabilities developed here can directly impact these missions by increasing science returns and decreasing costs. Understanding non-cooperative spacecraft trajectories is important as well, and has several applications. This applies to avoiding an actively hostile spacecraft, but also to impact mitigation between two non-communicating spacecraft/space objects that are at risk for collision. Impact mitigation is becoming increasingly important as the Earth's orbital sphere becomes more and more crowded with space debris."	12624
A Fiber Raman Spectrometer for Field Detecting Geological Materials, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	High throughput, fast detection and characterization of geological materials have become important challenge for future lunar robotic rover exploration and planetary missions. To allow for sample characterization on the moon and xxxxxx, rover missions need to decide what samples to acquire for further onboard analysis. An in situ non-destructive detection technique is highly desirable remote sensing tool for many future missions. We propose to develop a fiber xxxxxx spectrometer for field detecting of geological materials. Recent advances in fiber lasers, fiber optic probes and xxxxxx analysis techniques make the development of such a key component feasible. We expect our innovative design for fiber xxxxxx spectrometer will significantly improve the flexibility of remote xxxxxx collection, so that the field spectrometer's overall performance would be intact and extremely flexible for the field detection.	12625

These raw data .qub files are archived in the Imaging xxxxxx of the xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx (PDS). The calibrated spectra consist of radiance measurements for wavelengths between 0.7 - 5.2 micrometers.	12626
Reinforcement Learning For Coordination And Control of Swarming Satellites, Phase I	2018-06-01	2018-07-19	"Inspired by frequent observation of repetitive learned swarm behavior exhibited in nature, this novel program will develop and demonstrate new capabilities in decentralized control of large heterogeneous vehicle swarms limited in communication, sensors, and actuators, with direct application to communication-less coordination. These goals are accomplished through the adaptation and use of Reinforcement Learning solutions to the optimal control problem. Reinforcement Learning approaches define a value function, which represents the total reward for possible actions at a given state, deriving a decentralized formulation for each agent in a xxxxxx-Agent xxxxxx. The proposal implements the policy gradient method for Reinforcement Learning applied to swarming spacecraft control. Three major tasks are proposed for the development of swarming space vehicle coordination and control: xxxxxxroximate xxxxxximal Control for Large Swarms, Communication-Less Swarm Coordination Implementation, and Human-Swarm Interactions via xxxxxx. xxxxxx development in xxxxxx I will extend to a Centralized xxxxxximal Control xxxxxxution, Inverse Reinforcement Learning for the Local xxxxxxralized Problem, xxxxxx Free Learning, \"Expert xxxxxxution\" Conversions to the Local xxxxxx Local Interaction, Inverse Learning for Behavior Determination and Classification, Hyman Designed Dynamic Reward Functions, and xxxxxx. Follow-on efforts will are proposed for full implementation of the Reinforcement Learning swarm technology for real-time integrated system use and mission integration, including laboratory demonstrations of small robotic units, and the development of flight-qualified software and hardware packages for full integrated technology demonstrations."	12627

Flexible Screen Propellant Management Device for Near Term In-Space Demonstration, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	While evaluating lunar ascent and descent stage propellant acquisition options in 2008 and 2009 for xxxxxx GRC, IES conceived a novel, flexible screen propellant management device (PMD).  The concept provides a highly simplified and easy to build PMD as an alternative to a total communication device or one incorporating a start basket.  Water bench tests with a very primitive prototype yielded encouraging results, and additional, simple bench-level testing with LN2 was also encouraging.  An opportunity exists to refine the concept, develop a larger, more flight-like apparatus, and test it in a cryogenic tank currently being designed and subsequently intended for use on the xxxxxxgenic xxxxxx xxxxxx (CRYOTE) experiment.  Designing a full size flight qualifiable flexible screen PMD under a xxxxxx xxxxxx effort, followed by hardware fabrication, qualification and flight demonstration on a flight test platform concurrently in development, will allow this concept to be demonstrated for a fraction of the cost that would be required for a dedicated flight of a flexible PMD experiment.  The concept xxxxxx should move from 3 to 5 during xxxxxx, and 5 to 7 during xxxxxx 2.	12629
Multi-Axial Damage Index and Accumulation Model for Predicting Fatigue Life of CMC Materials, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	The fatigue life of CMCs must be well characterized for the safe and reliable use of these materials as integrated TPS components. Existing fatigue life prediction models for composite materials may be classified into three different categories: a) fatigue life model (S-N curves), b) residual strength or residual stiffness model, and c) progressive damage model.  Recently, a damage index and accumulation model has been developed by xxxxxx and xxxxxx based on Tsai-xxxxxx static strength failure criterion.  Using this approach as a framework, MR&D is proposing to develop and verify a relatively simple and computationally manageable approach to the fatigue life prediction of fabric reinforced C/xxxxxx composites for hypersonic vehicle load bearing thermal protection system designs.  A combined experimental and analytical program is proposed to achieve the objective of the proposed xxxxxx I effort. At the conclusion of xxxxxx I, a xxxxxx of 2 will have been achieved and progress towards achieving a xxxxxx of 3 will have been made.	12630
Venus Altitude Cycling Balloon, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The ISTAR Group ( IG) and team mate Thin Red xxxxxx xxxxxx (xxxxxxA) propose a xxxxxx altitude cycling balloon (xxxxxx ACB), an innovative superpressure balloon architecture that is ideally suited to cloud level mission parameters and to incorporation of a variety of buoyancy control mechanisms that will enable significant altitude cycling capability.  The 5.5 meter diameter vessel is similar to the dimensions contemplated for higher altitude xxxxxx missions. The pro posse xxxxxx ACB balloon platform is based on xxxxxxA's proprietary xxxxxx High Performance xxxxxx ( UHPV). The attributes that set UHPV apart in its unique ability to address the fundamental challenges confronting a cloud level xxxxxx balloon mission capable of significant altitude cycling are described in detail for these seven innovative design elements:   1. Strongest, lightest weight balloon option  2. xxxxxxoon fabrication is easier, less expensive, more accurate and highly reproducible  3.

Vertical Lift by Series Hybrid Power, Phase II	2018-04-01	2018-07-19	A major market for vertical lift aircraft is in urban operations, primarily for police and electronic news gathering (typically a Bell 206 or a Eurocopter AS350). Manned systems are more costly to operate and have a much larger operational footprint than their unmanned counterparts. But the unmanned multirotor does not have the range and endurance to compete with the manned systems. xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxs believes that the Passive xxxxxx (xxxxxx) Series Hybrid xxxxxx is a viable way to achieve the range and endurance required to penetrate the manned vehicle market. The xxxxxx, like the typical xxxxxx, uses delayed intake valve timing that allows the expansion ratio to be greater than the compression ratio; reducing pumping losses and giving greater energy extraction. But the xxxxxx does not use a positive displacement supercharger. The delayed intake valve closing also allows the xxxxxx greater quench in the combustion chamber to confront the fuel droplet issue associated with small engines. The delayed valve timing also allows the generator in the hybrid system to be optimized for power generation while still being used as the engine starter.xxxxxx on the models developed in the xxxxxx I program, xxxxxx will design, procure, and integrate the components required to demonstrate the Passive xxxxxx (xxxxxx) in a series hybrid architecture. The test system will be used to calibrate xxxxxx I models and design a multirotor using the xxxxxx hybrid system that will be able to perform police and news gathering missions.	12633

Cavehopping Exploration of Planetary Skylights and Tunnels	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	"The robots that venture into caves must leap, fly, or rappel into voids, traverse rubble, navigate safely in the dark, self-power, and explore autonomously with little or no communication to Earth. Exploiting these features necessitates a \"leap\" of technology from current planetary missions, which will be advanced by this team.xxxxxxsurface caverns may be the best place on xxxxxx to find life. They may be the best hope for safe havens and habitation on the xxxxxx. They can provide a window into a planet's geology, climate, and even biology. xxxxxxlights, formed by partial cave ceiling collapse, provide access to subsurface voids. Tunnel entrances have been conclusively shown to exist on xxxxxx and the xxxxxx. There is also evidence supporting their existence on other planetary bodies throughout the solar system. Despite astonishing discoveries of skylights and cave entrances, and their inevitable exploration, they do not yet appear in the decadal survey. xxxxxxlights and the voids below are so unknown that it is too risky to send astronauts to explore them without prior robotic reconnaissance and modeling. While robotic exploration of skylights and caves can seek out life, investigate geology and origins, and open the subsurface of other worlds to humankind, it is a daunting venture. xxxxxx voids present challenging terrain that requires innovative technologies for access, exploration, and modeling. The robots that venture into caves must leap, fly, or rappel into voids, traverse rubble, navigate safely in the dark, self-power, and explore autonomously with little or no communication to Earth. Exploiting these features necessitates a \"leap\" of technology from current planetary missions, which land with large error ellipses in statistically safe terrain, rove slowly and cautiously across the surface, depend on the sun for power and light, and rely heavily on human commands. xxxxxx develops the enabling technologies in the context of \"xxxxxx\", a prototype mission concept to explore a lunar skylight and cave. The xxxxxx mission specifies safe landing on the rim of a skylight, tethered descent of a power and communications hub, and autonomous cave exploration by multiple hybrid driving/hopping robots. In this context, the xxxxxx study will expose and address major feasibility issues inherent in mission architecture for skylight access; robot configuration for in-cave mobility and subsurface sensing; terrain modeling in darkness from a lightweight, dynamic platform; and autonomy for exploring with hopping robots."	12642

A Novel Microfluidic Device for Fully Automated Extraction of RNA from Cell Cultures, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	Differential gene expression by xxxxxx profiling is a universal and critical step in space biology experiments, which seek to link specific molecular events with disease phenotypes. Current xxxxxx preparation methods are tedious, require substantial astronaut time, and necessitate exposure to toxic chemicals. They often have poor, unreliable yields due to RNase contamination. Our overall objective is to develop and commercialize a microfluidics based miniaturized platform (MED-xxxxxx) that can fully automate the complex process of xxxxxx extraction. xxxxxxing from harvested whole mammalian cells in a culture medium, MED-xxxxxx will lyse, capture, extract/isolate and freeze/store xxxxxx content for later analysis, in a fully integrated fashion with minimal user intervention. In addition to higher yields and faster process times, losses and contamination will be minimized as a result of the miniaturization and automation. A novel and unique plastic card based fabrication technology from xxxxxxnics Corp. will be leveraged for low-cost microfabrication. In xxxxxx I, we will develop detailed design for the microfluidic lab card and the integrated system. We will also fabricate and demonstrate critical components (lysis and capture) of MED-xxxxxx. The design process will be based on the state-of-the-art, multiphysics biochip design software from CFDRC.

Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) Assistant Tool	2013-09-01	2018-07-19	The FMEA Assistant tool offers a new and unique approach to assist hardware developers and safety analysts perform failure analysis by using model based systems engineering concepts. xxxxxxs make several selections about their component's functions and inputs/outputs, then the tool recommends for consideration a list of potential failure modes based on a common failure modes list compiled over the course of several major human spaceflight programs.  The FMEA Assistant Tool can help the hardware developer and safety analyst identify early opportunities to design out failure modes, thereby prevent the need for re-design, and can save cost and schedule. The FMEA Assistant guides the analyst through a set of questions about component attributes, including subsystem type, kinds of resources used, and types of outputs.  The chosen attributes narrow down the number of possible choices of failure modes that make sense for that component.   The analyst need only consider a few small sets from the full list of common failure modes to find the appropriate ones.  The dialog is dynamic, so that the choices of failure modes presented change if the analyst changes the attribute selections. The tool also has extended the use of standardization by offering short lists of common failure causes and effects for each failure mode.   Two new features have recently been added: support for choosing hazards associated with identified failure modes and effects, and a library of standard components (e.g., valve, gauge, latch) with pre-selected failure modes.   	12648

Miniature Network Data Acquisition System for Airborne Sensors, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	Over-the-horizon communications and information networks are beginning to produce sustainable capabilities for Earth science operations using advanced unpiloted vehicles.  There is a growing need for affordable desktop access to globally deployable data acquisition and data processing sensor-web networks on board these airborne platforms.

Model-based Prognostics under Limited Sensing	2013-06-19	2018-07-19	Prognostics is crucial to providing reliable condition-based maintenance decisions. To obtain accurate predictions of component life, a variety of sensors are often needed. xxxxxxver, it is typically difficult to add enough sensors for reliable prognosis, due to system constraints such as cost and weight. xxxxxx-based prognostics helps to offset this problem by exploiting domain knowledge about the system, its components, and how they fail by casting the underlying physical phenomena in a physics-based model that is derived from first principles. We develop a model-based prognostics methodology using particle filters, and investigate the benefits of a model-based approach when sensor sets are diminished. We apply our approach to a detailed physics- based model of a pneumatic valve, and perform comprehensive simulation experiments to demonstrate the robustness of model-based approaches under limited sensing scenarios using prognostics performance metrics.	12654

Graded Density Carbon Bonded Carbon Fiber (CBCF) Preforms for Lightweight Ablative Thermal Protection Systems (TPS), Phase II	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	FMI has developed graded density CBCF preforms for graded density phenolic impregnated carbon ablator (PICA) material to meet xxxxxx future exploration mission requirements for higher performance ablative TPS.  Graded Preform PICA (GPP) will be achieved by the continued development of lightweight, graded density carbon preforms which will decrease the overall areal mass of the resulting TPS material while enhancing its thermal performance capability.  The preform material designed to achieve this goal is comprised of a more mechanically robust, ablating outer layer and a lower weight, lower thermal conductivity inner layer than state-of-the-art PICA material. The ablative outer layer and thermal inner layer will be integrated in a continuously cast, monolithic material with equivalent capability for resin impregnation and conversion to PICA as the baseline existing preform material (xxxxxxForm&#174;).  During the proposed xxxxxx program, FMI will continue to develop its capability to produce graded density preform material to achieve TPS areal mass reductions estimated between 17-25% relative to PICA with the goal of improving ablation performance. The developed preform materials will be converted to GPP and then characterized mechanically, thermally, and tested for ablation performance.  In addition to providing a pathway for these enhancements to tile acreage PICA TPS ablator material, FMI will incorporate the developed processing methodology to produce near net-shaped cast PICA TPS material preforms with a reduced density gradient compared to baseline manufacturing techniques.	12660

Picosats for Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking Technology Demonstration, Phase I	2010-01-01	2018-07-19	"Over the next decade, a host of new technologies and capabilities will be needed by xxxxxx to support Project Constellation. For risk reduction considerations, it is desirable that they be flown on other missions prior to use on vehicles such as xxxxxxn or xxxxxx.  An innovative and cost-effective approach to doing so is to use picosats, which are miniaturized spacecraft with masses on the order of a few kilograms. Because of their size, weight and power requirements, they are ideal for low-cost, quick-turn-around technology demonstration missions. Picosats are now being developed at universities by teams of students for \"hands on\" experience with real space hardware. The xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx at xxxxxx (UT) and xxxxxx A&M xxxxxxersity (TAMU), for example, are working with xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx to implement a series of four picosat missions that would culminate in an on-orbit demonstration of autonomous rendezvous and docking (AR&D).

Plasma Control of Turbine Secondary Flows, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	"We propose xxxxxx I and II efforts that will focus on turbomachinery flow control. Specifically, the present work will investigate active control in a high speed turbine flow. The flow control actuators will be Single xxxxxx Barrier Discharge (SDBD), or \"plasma actuators.\" The work will be primarily experimental, with a focus on realistic operating environments for investigating the efficacy of the actuators. The proposed measurements will be the first to utilize plasma flow control in an aerodynamically realistic LPT environment. The objective of the research will be to study the secondary flows in a modern low pressure turbine (LPT) environment, and use active flow control to provide enhanced aerodynamic and/or heat transfer characteristics by controlling the secondary flows through the nozzle and rotor sections of the turbine. The research will build upon extensive experimental development and numerical modeling of weakly-ionized plasma actuators for flow control applications. The study of these actuators in realistic operating environments will be made possible using a new transonic turbine rig located at the xxxxxxersity of Notre Dame. The objectives of the proposed research will involve measurements of the baseline flow field, including the secondary flows produced by the inlet nozzle vanes and the rotor vanes. These data will be used to motivate the actuator design for reduced secondary flows and losses. Specifically, a conceptual model will be constructed to describe how vorticity from the endwall boundary layers, blade surface, and tip gap is stretched and convected into regions of high loss. The actuators will be used to modify the unsteady surface vorticity flux through the plasma body force in order to reduce the net secondary flow losses."	12667
Multi-Platform Sensor Surveillance Network for Range Control, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx (xxxxxx, FL) and its partners Aerial Products (Deland, FL) and Meridian xxxxxxs LLC (Titusville, FL) propose to develop a revolutionary new type of system which is both modular and standardized, and which can effectively interface with existing sensors such as range radar and acoustic intrusion detectors.  The system for launch surveillance/intrusion detection is based on a network of uncooled long wavelength infrared (xxxxxx) imagers with associated xxxxxx Positioning xxxxxx (GPS) sensors and magnetic compass heading indicators, integrated into a small  package which can be deployed on small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), balloons or blimps, and fixed towers.  xxxxxx imagers are chosen for their day/night and all-weather capability and because recent advances in uncooled technology has allowed the price of these sensors to become low enough for fielding a relatively large number of imagers in a cost effective manner.These xxxxxx sensors and integrated instrumentation will provide for the remote detection, recognition, and identification of persons and objects that have intruded into areas of the range that must be cleared in order to conduct safe launch operations. In order to achieve accurate identification, the time and position of potential intrusions will be recorded in a \"track file\" for each detection incidence.  xxxxxx fusion techniques will fuse tracks from various sensors into a single track when possible, and objects will be tracked with multi-target tracking techniques as necessary. This will require the use of encrypted communication, so track data and associated intruder imagery from individual sensors can be combined at a centralized control station as a fused track file. In the cases where intrusions are deemed security risks, further action can be undertaken, such as deployment of a small UAV to the intrusion site for real time observation, while range control and security evaluate the situation."	12668

Low-Stress Silicon Cladding for Surface Finishing Large UVOIR Mirrors, Phase II	2016-04-01	2018-07-19	In this xxxxxx I research, xxxxxx Corporation demonstrated a low-stress silicon cladding process for surface finishing large UVOIR mirrors. A polishable cladding is desired for xxxxxx optics so they may be figured in less time, and so they may be polished to levels suitable for UVOIR astronomy.  xxxxxx has filed a provisional US patent application for the technology.  The proposed process is directly scalable to xxxxxx mirrors several meters in diameter. The process is based on a novel, low temperature, ion-assisted, evaporation technique (IAD), whereby the coating stress of a silicon film may be manipulated from compressive to tensile, in order to produce a near-zero net stress for the complete layer. A Si cladding with little intrinsic stress is essential to allow thick coatings to be manufactured without cracking.  A low stress coating also minimizes substrate bending that would otherwise distort the figure of very lightweight mirrors.	12670
A cubesat hyperspectral imager, Phase I	2017-06-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx spectrometers have been extremely useful in multiple xxxxxx applications, from Earth climate monitoring to identifying hydrocarbon lakes on xxxxxx.  Traditionally, imaging spectroscopy systems are not only heavy but also large in order to accommodate the long path lengths needed for spectral separation.  There are several varieties, such as push-broom and scanning imaging spectrometers, but hyperspectral framing cameras are still relatively rare and are often untenably bulky.  xxxxxxver, framing cameras place fewer restrictions on platform motion and can complete their data acquisition more rapidly, which allows more time and power to be dedicated to other instruments.  A chip-scale full-frame hyperspectral imager would provide the ideal balance: small, light, no moving parts, low power requirements, and suitable for numerous mission architectures.xxxxxxhmics, teaming with Dr. xxxxxx at the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx, proposes to develop a chip-scale hyperspectral imaging technology as a commercial solution for ultra-compact UV-VIS hyperspectral cameras for smallsat and CubeSat applications.

The key innovation in this effort is to combine recently available large, high photorefractive damage threshold, z-cut 5% xxxxxx:LN with novel ridge fabrication techniques to achieve high optical power, low cost, high volume manufacturing of frequency conversion structures.  The proposed ridge waveguide structure should maintain the characteristics of the periodically poled bulk substrate, allowing for the efficient frequency conversion typical of waveguides and the high optical damage threshold and long lifetimes typical of the 5% doped bulk substrate.  The low cost and large area of 5% xxxxxx:LN wafers and the improved performance of the proposed ridge waveguide structure will enhance existing measurement capabilities as well as reduce the resources required to achieve high performance specifications.  For these reasons, the development of ridge waveguides in 5% xxxxxx:LN directly addresses xxxxxx xxxxxxovative xxxxxxs, xxxxxxors and xxxxxxents for xxxxxx xxxxxx, STTR subtopic T4.01: xxxxxx, xxxxxx and Coherent xxxxxx Bundle Arrays.	12674

Vibrating Wingstroke Mechanism, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	This proposed work will develop a new method and mechanism for generating wing stroke motion of any shape and orientation.  The mechanism will provide power, lift and flight control to small aircraft in a single integrated unit.  The key innovation is the means by which wing motion is generated without the use any complex mechanical components.  Wing motion of any shape and orientation can be generated with this mechanism.  The arrangement of wings is such that the mechanism is mechanically balanced and exerts no net torque or force on the aircraft.  This method is applicable to small UAVs (uninhabited aerial vehicles) and will provide them with a simple and reliable means of producing power, lift and flight control.  The versatility of this mechanism is expected to provide UAVs with high maneuverability.  This method will be most valuable for UAVs that are used as planetary aircraft as well as for general surveillance and reconnaissance.	12676

This xxxxxx proposal continues development of a small, portable, detection system specifically for the collection, speciation and identification of gas phase and aerosolized organics. This Mini Gas Chromatograph collects samples and operates without the need for compressed-bottled gas by using xxxxxx's proprietary chemicapacitive sensor array and commercial sensors with a preconcentration/chromatography system, combining selectivity from a diverse sensor array with a miniature sampling system for amplified sensitivity.

Integration of 4D Airline Operation Control Systems into NextGen and the NAS, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	WxOps patent pending Opsxxxxxxt(TM) software and 4D geospatial data are used by xxxxxxan Airlines to achieve unprecedented Airline Operation Control (AOC) in a geobrowser-based Common Operating Environment (COE).  Dispatchers and pilots coordinate flight operations in real time using identical xxxxxx based visualizations on desktops and tablets both on the ground and in the cockpit during flight.  Google has unilaterally deprecated critical functionality which causes the latest versions of the xxxxxx application to be unsuitable for FAA regulated flight operations.  Additional unilateral changes to Google licensing terms are impacting applications for international transportation, particularly for flight operations in Asia.  WxOps has anticipated the need for an alternate geobrowser, and has tested xxxxxx World Wind open source components for critical functionality needed at xxxxxxan.   xxxxxx World Wind provides the equivalent or superior performance for critical functions when compared to xxxxxx.  WxOps proposes to enhance and harden xxxxxx World Wind open source to achieve and potentially exceed the equivalent of xxxxxx best practices.  This includes the introduction of a COM API software interface for coupling of xxxxxx World Wind with WxOps Opsxxxxxxt(TM) and other flight operations software.  A successful outcome will provide a reliable geobrowser capability which can serve transportation community applications in the years to come without fear of deprecation by an uninterested commercial interest.

Cryogenic MEMS Technology for Sensing Applications, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	The development of cryogenic microwave components, such as focal plane polarization modulators, first requires an RF MEMS switching technology that operates effectively at cryogenic temperatures. The approach of this project is to explore the performance of capacitive MEMS switching technology at low temperatures. MEMS capacitive switches represent an alternative to ohmic contact switches, where the RF impedance of the device is not dependent on metal-metal contacts. These MEMS switches operate with much lower effective series resistance (generally ~ 0.25 ohms) and do not have the issues associated with dry contact switching. This technology also has the advantage of operating very well at millimeter-wave frequencies and higher, where many of the most demanding performance limitations exist. This technology has seen significant investment through DAxxxxxx and the xxxxxx, and is directly applicable to high-performance microwave components needed in several of the upcoming xxxxxx missions.	12684
Flexible Polymer Sensor for Space Suits, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	Perception xxxxxx has developed an innovative new type of compliant tactile sensing solution, a polymeric skin (PolySkinTM) that can be molded into any form factor, supports a variety of mechanical properties, and is inherently inexpensive and durable. This novel tactile sensor surmounts the failures of prior tactile solutions with sophisticated multi-modal sensing capabilities, modeled after human hand sensing specifications, coupled with robust design for industrial and space applications.  PolySkin is a perfect choice for measuring space suit interactions with the human body because it was designed for a similar problem: detect contact to allow robots to safely operate in an unstructured environment. PolySkin measures mechanical pressure accurately, has a good resistant to aberrant readings when under moderate bending, shear or torsion, is sufficiently pliant to follow anatomical curves on the human skin without discomfort or lack of mobility, it can be fabricated in thin profiles (~mm) and packaged sufficiently small, free of rigid or sharp points, and it consumes low power. During this project, we will fabricate a flat prototype of our novel tactile sensor and characterize and optimize the elastomer formulation to achieve desired properties: accuracy within 10%, dynamic range: 0.1 to 10N, and high repeatability (<5% error). We will build conditioning electronics to provide serial output signal through a USB port. After passing initial test, calibration, and validation,  the conditioning electronics will be used to test in-sleeve embedded sensor. In a final proof-of-concept milestone, we will fabricate a working prototype wearable sleeve embedded with PolySkin to validate the performance. The deliverables include a 4x4 inch pad sensor at the end of 3rd month, and a wearable sleeve with embedded PolySkin sensor combined with conditioning electronics kit at the end of the project.	12685

Key Real-World Applications of Classifier Ensembles	2012-02-26	2018-07-19	Broad classes of statistical classification algorithms have beendeveloped and applied successfully to a wide range of real worlddomains. In general, ensuring that the particular classificationalgorithm matches the properties of the data is crucial inproviding results that meet the needs of the particular applicationdomain. One way in which the impact of this algorithm/applicationmatch can be alleviated is by using ensembles of classifiers, wherea variety of classifiers (either different types of classifiers ordifferent instantiations of the same classifier) are pooled before afinal classification decision is made. Intuitively, classifierensembles allow the different needs of a difficult problem to behandled by classifiers suited to those particular needs.xxxxxxly, classifier ensembles provide an extra degree offreedom in the classical bias/variance tradeoff, allowing solutionsthat would be difficult (if not impossible) to reach with only asingle classifier. Because of these advantages, classifier ensembles have been applied to many difficult real world problems. In this paper, we surveyselect applications of ensemble methods to problems that havehistorically been most representative of the difficulties inclassification. In particular, we survey applications of ensemblemethods to remote sensing, person recognition, one vs. allrecognition, and medicine.	12696

Methods to Remove Coke from Endothermic Heat Exchangers, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	Currently xxxxxx space program is recognized as the world leader in providing access to space.  xxxxxxver, in order to maintain this position, it will be necessary to reduce the very high cost of reaching low Earth orbit by using single stage or two stage to orbit vehicles.  Some components of these vehicles have exceptionally high heat loads and require additional cooling capacity, which can be accommodated by utilizing the additional fuel heat sink capacity available from endothermic cracking reactions.  Unfortunately, cracking reactions lead to coke deposition in the heat exchanger, which can be a potentially serious problem if it is allowed to accumulate. Therefore in this xxxxxx I proposal, TDA xxxxxxearch, xxxxxx. (TDA) will develop methods to remove the coke from the heat exchanger flow path.  Previously, several different coke formation mechanisms were though to occur during cracking and the selection of an appropriate method to remove the coke would depend on the mechanism responsible.  xxxxxxver, as a result of previous work, we have identified the mechanism primarily responsible for coke deposition with JP-7 and JP-8.  Thus, the methods we develop in this xxxxxx xxxxxx I proposal have a high probability of success.	12718

Improving Diagnosability of Hybrid Systems through Active Diagnosis	2014-01-07	2018-07-19	xxxxxx diagnosis is key to ensuring system safety through fault-adaptive control. This task is diffcult in hybrid systems with combined continuous and discrete behaviors because mode changes make diagnosability hard to achieve. xxxxxxluding additional sensors can improve diagnosability, but that is not always feasible.

This innovative design will meet launch volume constraints and satisfy terminal aerobraking requirements. The approach will focus on transpiration cooling of a flexible material and employs preceramic polymers and active filler technologies as key features of the TPS design. The major hurdle to inflatable aerobrakes becoming reality is the development of a lightweight and structurally flexible TPS. xxxxxxernative designs have focused on complex multilayering to increase the effective emissivity of the material, whereas xxxxxx will focus on reducing the thickness, thus decreasing the overall system mass.

Space-Qualifiable Cyanate Ester Elastomer, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	Cornerstone xxxxxxearch Group, xxxxxx. (CRG) proposes to design and develop a space-qualifiable cyanate ester elastomer for application in self-deployable space structures and future aircraft systems.  Having already demonstrated the feasibility of the current cyanate ester shape memory polymer (SMP) as a space-qualifiable material, CRG proposes to refine its existing cyanate ester SMP to provide the flexibility necessary for self-deployable space structures.  xxxxxx extensively on deployable structure systems for xxxxxx and DoD projects (see section 5.2), CRG has demonstrated the feasibility of self-deploying structures by using surrogate styrene-based systems.

Advanced Structural Health Monitoring, Phase I	2018-06-01	2018-07-19	Frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) are periodic arrays of conductive elements or patches that cause a particular reflection or transmission response when illuminated with high frequency electromagnetic energy. These arrays have been used as high frequency filters and in radar, stealth and advanced antenna applications, and more recently, as sensors. In particular, FSS-based sensing has found a home as a next-generation structural health monitoring (SHM) approach. FSS sensors are inherently wireless and passive, and are interrogated remotely via microwave energy. These sensors can be embedded in layered dielectric (non-conducting) structures during manufacture or installed during the service lifetime on the surface (conductive or dielectric). xxxxxxs penetrate through dielectrics, so in the case of layered structures, FSS sensors can be placed on materials/layers of interest that may be covered by additional dielectrics (such as reentry heat tiles covered with insulation). xxxxxx sensing parameters can be concurrently sensed through proper sensor design and interrogation, as is illustrated below through a strain and temperature sensor.

High-Efficiency, Ka-Band Solid-State Power Amplifier Utilizing GaN Technology, Phase II	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	QuinStar xxxxxx proposes to develop a high-efficiency, solid-state power amplifier (SSPA), operating at xxxxxx frequencies, for high data rate, long range space communications. Specifically, we propose to develop a 20 W power amplifier with an associated PAE of 60% operating over the 31.5 to 34 GHz band. This will be accomplished by employing two major innovations. First, we plan to utilize wide bandgap Gallium Nitride (xxxxxx) on xxxxxx Carbide (xxxxxx) device technology to fabricate our high-efficiency MMICs. Operating at a higher voltage (typically 20-28 V versus 4-5 V for xxxxxx), xxxxxx permits power densities which are 5-10 times higher than xxxxxx or InP. In addition to a higher power density, high-voltage operation results in lower matching and cell combining losses, making these MMICs more efficient. xxxxxxondly, we are proposing to utilize a switching mode of operation (Class-F) to enhance the device efficiency. While this method has demonstrated PAE levels of >80% at 2 GHz, these levels have not yet been realized at xxxxxx frequencies. Computer simulations, contained in this proposal, indicate that by using this method, device PAE levels ranging up to 73% are possible at 32 GHz. Furthermore, this was verified by benchmark data from at least one xxxxxx foundry showing a device, operating in Class-F, with a PAE of 80% at 3 GHz. Finally, simulations at xxxxxx frequencies indicate that even with circuit losses, we can still maintain the efficiency (PAE) at or very close to 60%. The layout and performance of a multistage MMIC is included in this proposal, together with the overall SSPA configuration and performance.	12734

Approximate Cartesian Control for Robotic Tool Usage with Graceful Degradation, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	"Many of xxxxxx exploration scenarios include important roles for autonomous or partially autonomous robots.  It is desirable for them to utilize human tools when possible, rather than needing to build custom tools for each robot.  Control of robotic manipulators for tool usage generally requires a very precise Cartesian-space trajectory of the tool tip (e.g., moving a marker along the surface of a whiteboard or rotating a screwdriver about an axis).  Well-known techniques exist for manipulator control in Cartesian space, most of which necessitate solving a series of Inverse Kinematics (IK) problems.  Closed-form IK solvers work well for 7-degree-of-freedom (DOF) arms with rigid tool attachments, but cannot handle non-rigid tools that slip in the robot's hands.  Numerical IK approaches are more generic and can handle non-rigid links to tools, but can be slow to converge.  More importantly, if any joints fail or become limited in their range of motion, the robot arm essentially becomes 6-DOF or lower.  IK solvers often fail in these lower DOF spaces because the configuration space becomes non-continuous and full of \"holes\".  As a result, a 7-DOF robotic arm in space might be rendered largely useless if a single joint fails or even loses mobility until it can be serviced.  xxxxxx proposes to investigate an alternative approach to traditional Cartesian control approaches, which rely on complex IK solvers that go from Cartesian space backwards to joint space.  We propose to leverage cheap memory and modern processing speeds to instead perform simple computations that go from joint space forwards to Cartesian space.  Such techniques should overcome common changes to a manipulation chain caused by tool slippage or the grasping of a new tool and to overcome uncommon changes to a chain caused by joint failures, reduced joint mobility, changes in joint geometry or range of motion, or added joints."	12736

Real-time accurate and high-resolution maps of the surface are needed for autonomously identifying and navigating towards safe landing sites. Local surface maps that can be tied globally to reconnaissance maps will also enable missions with multiple ground assets to position those assets in their desired locations. OASSIS will develop algorithms and techniques that actively re-map or update surface maps during descent to eliminate navigation errors, develop safe site identification and selection algorithms, and implement a robotic emulation platform for hardware-in-the-loop testing of critical precision landing functions.	12737
Integrated Composite - Heatpipe Radiator Panel, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	A major objective of the xxxxxx science spacecraft systems development programs is to implement science measurement capabilities using small affordable spacecrafts. High conductivity materials to minimize temperature gradients and provide high efficiency radiators and heat spreader panels are required to meet this objective. Under this proposed effort, kTC will develop a high performance thermal distribution panel (TDP) concept. The panel will be fabricated with a high conductivity macro composite skin and in situ heat pipes. The processing technologies proposed to build such a panel can also be used to produce this panel with high structural stiffness, similar to aluminum honeycomb type structure currently in use. This advanced TDP material concept will have high conductance the will obviate the need for attached bulky metal thermal doublers and heat pipe saddles. The conductivity of the proposed material system can be configured to exceed 800 W/mK with a mass density below 2.5 g/cm3. This material can provide efficient conductive heat transfer between the in situ heat pipes permitting the use of thinner panel thicknesses further reducing the mass of this critical spacecraft subsystem. This concept will also obviate reliability challenges due to CTE mismatch between structures and the heat pipes.  In the xxxxxx I program, kTC will produce prototypes employing the proposed TDP concept. In xxxxxx, in conjunction with kTC's Tier I team members, the qualification and integration of the concept into spaceflight hardware will be pursued.	12738

High Energy Density Capacitors, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx?s future space science missions cannot be realized without the state of the art energy storage devices which require high energy density, high reliability, and low cost dielectric materials. T/J Technologies proposes to develop and demonstrate high energy density, fast-rise, and high reliability dielectric materials for these applications.

Autonomous Mission Operations	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	The AES Autonomous Mission Operations project will develop understanding of the impacts of increasing communication time delays on mission operations and develop automation technologies to mitigate the impacts. The technologies are expected to reduce operations costs as well. This will be tested on xxxxxx in FY14. The results of this project are being incorporated and built upon in the Autonomous xxxxxxs and Operations project.  Future human spaceflight missions will occur with crews and spacecraft at large distances, with long communication delays to the Earth. The one-way light-time delay to the xxxxxx is 1.3 seconds, which is sufficient to make some scenarios (e.g. landing) difficult or impossible to conduct from Earth. One-way communication delays to human exploration destinations such as Near Earth xxxxxx (NEA) at close approach range from seconds to minutes. The one-way light-time delay to xxxxxx ranges from 3 minutes (at conjunction) to 22 minutes (at opposition). As the communication delays increase, the crews in the spacecraft must execute, and manage, much of the mission themselves. Throughout the course of a mission, as distances increase, xxxxxx must continue to migrate operations functionality from the Mission Control Center flight control room to the vehicle for use by the crew. The role of the ground control teams and systems will evolve away from real-time support to more long-range planning, diagnosis, analysis and prognostics support role. While the vehicle systems and crew must take on the role of onboard daily schedule execution, planning, and systems management. Both ground and vehicle systems will require automation to maximize crew functionality, minimize unnecessary overhead, and reduce operating costs. This project is to understand the impacts of increasing communications time delays on operations and to develop technologies to mitigate the impacts.	12745

Lightweight Small-Scale Turbine Generator, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	The proposed innovation is a propulsion technology that will help achieve xxxxxx Fundamental Aeronautics Program (FAP) goals of reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency for high speed flight.  xxxxxx objective to achieve increase the specific power of high efficiency electric components to make a 10 mega-watt onboard power generation and/or utilization feasible for propulsion requires the development of sub-scale technologies to support the development and validation of newer turbo-electric aircraft and embedded boundary layer electric propulsion systems.  Compact and lightweight generators scaling from the kW to MW class are needed to transition high speed aircraft to hybrid electric propulsion systems. Metis Design Corp is developing a lightweight, small-scale, gas turbine generator that draws on recent innovations in the fields of permanent magnet generators and turbomachinery, which has a target power density over twice the state-of-the-art and the potential to scale to 100's of kW.  The proposed turbine engine uses a lightweight, two-spool configuration that eliminates the need for the heavy reduction gearbox required by state-of-the-art systems.  xxxxxx I of this xxxxxx will develop a preliminary design of the turbine generator sub-system and develop a detailed design, fabricate and test the innovative generator hardware.  A follow-on phase II effort will develop a detailed design, fabricate and test the complete turbine generator sub-system.	12752
A Modular Minimum Cost Launch System for Nano-Satellites, Phase II	2013-03-01	2018-07-19	As minimum cost will be required for a dedicated xxxxxx-Sat Launch Vehicle, a parallel staged, highly modular vehicle architecture is proposed for development. The principal advantage of a modular architecture for this size of vehicle is the single propulsion development for the boost stages at a relatively small scale.  This approach drastically shortens development timelines and cost. A candidate launch vehicle with a cluster of seven identical modules would light 4 modules for the first stage, 2 for the second, 1 for the third, and fire 1 small spinning Apogee xxxxxx (AKM) for the fourth. xxxxxx (WASP) proposes to refine the xxxxxx design of an all-composite, xxxxxx-fed Hybrid xxxxxx Motor (HRM) propelled, 25 kg to LEO launcher. WASP will then build and fire the AKM, build and fire the core module HRM, then launch the full-scale core module as an unguided sounding rocket from a commercial range. At the conclusion of xxxxxx 2, the technology will be at a xxxxxx level of 6.	12753

Aircraft Anomaly Prognostics, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx Group will leverage its proven xxxxxxmechanical xxxxxx (EMA) prognostics methodology to develop an advanced model-based actuator prognostic reasoner (MAPR). xxxxxx's concept is a self-contained, embedded prognostic reasoner with a passive connection to common avionic data busses. By monitoring actuator health in real time and providing early warning of incipient fault conditions, the proposed MAPR would enable condition based maintenance (CBM) of critical avionic flight control systems and support safer, more reliable next generation air transportation. The novel approach will effectively decouple the passive prognostic reasoner from the target flight control system, or actuator, and will support multiple avionic data bus interfaces, such as MIL-STD-1553, easing adoption, validation, integration, and support. Potentially, a single MAPR could monitor multiple flight control systems, reducing overall sensor costs. Furthermore, an embedded MAPR implementation with field upgradeable firmware would support evolving interface standards and prognostic health measurement capabilities. Finally, the proposed MAPR architecture is ideally suited for hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing, which dramatically accelerates technology readiness and commercial introduction.	12755

Impact-Actuated Digging Tool for Lunar Excavation, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx proposes to develop a vacuum compatible, impact-actuated digging tool for the excavation of frozen and compacted regolith on the lunar surface and in the permanently shadowed craters of the lunar poles.  This technology development effort will address the most challenging aspects of excavation in the lunar environment and work to develop a design relevant to a range of future lunar missions.  This effort will also serve to guide and inform the requirements for the vehicles and systems that will be necessary for such missions. The fundamental architecture of an impact-actuated digging tool has been demonstrated for terrestrial applications for the Department of Defense.  xxxxxx's digging tool design is a novel approach ideally suited for lunar applications to defeat compacted and frozen regolith.  By using the impact energy imparted by a reciprocating hammer transferred through the scoop to defeat the target material, the need for large reaction loads from the vehicle is minimized, allowing for a much smaller, lower mass system. This ongoing effort will serve to instruct and maximize the benefit to xxxxxx.	12764

Use knowledge gained from these investigations to provide new understanding of the xxxxxx-nitride system and to improve EUV detector structural design. It is intended that EUV detector wafers will also be delivered to xxxxxx scientists for the fabrication of detector arrays.  xxxxxx performances of xxxxxx based EUV detectors over conventional existing technologies are expected.	12765
Monitoring of Bone Loss Biomarkers in Human Sweat: A Non-Invasive, Time Efficient Means of Monitoring Bone Resorption Markers under Micro and Partial Gravity Loading Conditions	2012-05-01	2018-07-19	The overall goal of this project was to validate the concept that the rate and extent of unloading-induced bone loss in humans can be assessed by monitoring the levels of two bone resorption markers in sweat, namely ionized calcium (Ca2+) and total collagen cross-links (T-CCL) (i.e., the pyridinium cross-links PYD & DPD) The original funded project plan called for a phased approach consisting of three phases; the first phase focused on selection of the most appropriate and efficient means of collecting a sweat sample from an individual compatible with the microgravity environment of space flight coupled with biochemical validation that these sweat samples contained bone resorption markers at levels capable of being detected using standard laboratory analysis techniques; the second phase focused on validation of the concept that bone resorption marker levels detected in sweat samples accurately and consistently reflected circulating levels and/or urine levels of these biomarkers; and the third phase focused on longitudinal assessment of bone resorption marker level in sweat, blood, and urine in young and old populations undergoing active bone formation or bone loss, respectively.     After successful completion of xxxxxx I, preliminary data generated during xxxxxx indicated that the xxxxxx criterion measure for bone loss during space flight (i.e., 24 hr urinary ionized calcium excretion), while related to calcium and T-CCL levels in sweat samples actively produced during defined exercise, were not predictive of 24 hr urine calcium excretion rates. After consultation and review of the preliminary xxxxxx results by representatives of the xxxxxx-Johsnon xxxxxx-Human xxxxxxearch Program (JSC-HRP), the focus of xxxxxx was redirected to explore collection of a 24 hr sweat sample, rather than collection of a discrete, exercise-induced “active” sweat sample, to determine if a 24 hr integrated sweat sample was predictive of biomarker concentrations found in 24 hr urine samples. This redirection of effort required the identification and validation of additional commercially available absorbant materials which did not contain endogenous biomarker signal as well as a means of extracting the biomarkers from the absorbant material compatible with fluid handling limitations in the space flight environment. After identifying and developing such a collection method, this approach was then utilized to answer the question of whether or not biomarker levels in an integrated 24 hr sweat sample was predictive of those found in a concurrent 24 hr urine sample in a convenience of healthy individuals.     After successful completion of xxxxxx, the xxxxxx-JSC-HRP program indicated that they wished to deploy the sweat monitoring technology in a xxxxxx bed-rest campaigns being performed at the GCRC at xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx Medical Branch (UTMB) instead of in young and old subject populations as originally planned. Unfortunately however, during the last 9 months of the project xxxxxx had to postpone bed-rest operations resulting in a joint decision by xxxxxx-HRP and the Principal Investigator to utilize spinal-injured patients recruited from the xxxxxx Medical Center (rather than xxxxxx bed rest subjects) in which to test the 24 hr sweat monitoring technology as means of assessing bone loss. The resulting time delay surrounding availability of bed rest subjects and the subsequent decision to utilize spinal chord injury (SCI) patients, coupled with the additional requirement to seek Committee for the Protection of Human xxxxxx (CPHS) approval for testing in a new subject population resulted in xxxxxx granting a one year no-cost extension to the project. xxxxxx data gathered in the final year of the project provides evidence that biomarker levels in a 24 hr integrated sweat sample are predictive of those levels found in 24 hr urine samples in SCI patients. These data indicate that 24 hr sweat sample collection (using a collection and analysis scheme compatible with space flight operations) in a terrestrial human population undergoing active bone loss in a similar fashion to crew members during space flight is a non-invasive, time-efficient alternative to on-orbit 24 hr urine void collection as means of assessing biomarkers of bone loss. In addition, the ability to perform this type of sample collection using a microgravity compatible approach to liquid sample handling and the use of simple colorimetric based analysis techniques is of notable operational relevancy. Our data and validated methodologies suggest that sweat biomarker analysis (as an operationally compatible means of assessing and/or monitoring bone loss in crew members during space flight) should be considered for further development as a “real-time” analytical method for assessment of space flight-induced bone loss and a valid means of monitoring the efficacy of “in-flight” bone loss countermeasures.

Bonding and Analysis of Composite TRAC Booms for NASA Science Missions, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	A new deployable spacecraft boom technology called xxxxxx (TRxxxxxxM Boom), invented by the Air Force xxxxxxoratory and exclusively licensed by xxxxxx, is being considered by xxxxxx for numerous missions including the Comet Rendezvous, Sample Acquisition, Isolation, and xxxxxx (CORSAIR) mission being developed by xxxxxx.  For CORSAIR, xxxxxx has baselined a rather robust high strain composite (HSC) xxxxxx to tether a comet Sample Acquisition and Retrieving Projectile (xxxxxxP) to the spacecraft and prevent the harpoon-like penetrator from recoiling back and impacting the spacecraft during retrieval.  xxxxxxver, questions remain as to how to design and build a composite xxxxxx with sufficient strength so as to tolerate the relatively long storage time (several years in-transit to the comet) and relatively high deployment speeds (~30-150 f/s) necessary for the CORSAIR harpoon system.To address this challenge during xxxxxx, xxxxxx proposes to improve the performance of the bondline in composite xxxxxx by reinforcing the adhesive joint and developing mechanical end fittings that allow higher packaging strains while minimizing creep.  We also propose to validate a relatively low cost, out-of-autoclave process for affecting the bond, and validate analytical models to simulate the time- and temperature-dependent viscoelastic behavior of composite TRAC bonded joint, and guide engineering qualification of the joints for future xxxxxx missions, including CORSAIR.  Moreover, xxxxxx will also further optimize the system design, including proximal and distall end fittings that connect xxxxxx into the CORSAIR storage canister and sample return projectile to validate strength and creep performance to mission requirements, and to incorporate load-limiting features that prevent catastrophic failure of the TRAC boom during operation.	12767
Integrated Task and Motion Planning with Verification via Formal Methods	2021-08-01	2018-07-19	"This proposal lays out a research plan to \"lift\" current state-of-the-art results combining discrete and continuous layers of planning in motion planning to the more difficult and more useful problem of task and motion planning. The impact of such research is quite broad, and the current advances in AI and motion planning have made research in this area a hot topic in the robotics community. The uniqueness of this plan lies largely in the proposal to develop tools for verification and falsification in parallel with the tools for task and motion planning. It is expected that doing so will lead to more practical tools for our current robot systems.The significance for xxxxxx is quite broad. xxxxxxrally, xxxxxx wants to use robots for remote exploration and for collaboration with astronauts. xxxxxx wants robots to perform tasks that are too dangerous (searching for damage on the exterior of the xxxxxx), too remote (exploring xxxxxx), or too difficult (moving heavy objects on the moon) for a human. By increasing the level of autonomy in robots and by ensuring that they function safely and correctly, the depth and extent of missions can be increased."	12768

High Count Rate Single Photon Counting Detector Array, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	An optical communications receiver requires efficient and high-rate photon-counting capability so that the information from every photon, received at the aperture, is processed. This is particularly true in space platforms, where the information contained in every additional photon detected directly translates into lower system size, weight, and power (SWAP). To address this need, a near-infrared (NIR) high gain, low excess noise avalanche photodiode (APD) array will be developed for photon counting flight receivers. The proposed APD array technology is capable of a single photon detection efficiency (SPDE) greater than 50% at 100's Mhz count rate. It will be shown possible to discriminate photo-generated events from dark-initiated events, so that when the APD is configured with a low noise readout circuit, with sufficient bandwidth detection circuits, that low false alarm rates (FARs) can be achieved.	12771
High Frequency Measurements in Shock-Wave/Turbulent Boundary-Layer Interaction at Duplicated Flight Conditions, Phase II	2015-06-01	2018-07-19	Large amplitude, unsteady heating loads and steep flow gradients produced in regions of shock-wave/turbulent boundary-layer interaction (SWTBLI) pose a serious and challenging problem for designers of hypersonic vehicles. Characterizing SWTBLI flow features, such as the size of flow separation, is important for design evaluation and CFD validation. xxxxxx and CUBRC propose to develop a wide-bandwidth, thin-film heat transfer sensor system that quantifies the high frequency SWTBLI at duplicated flight conditions. This effort combines xxxxxx' high frequency-response/high-sensitivity electronics and signal processing techniques with the unique expertise of CUBRC in high-speed, high-enthalpy flows to obtain spatiotemporal information for the development of physics-based turbulence models.	12772
CTE-Matched, Liquid-Cooled, High Thermal Conductivity Heat Sink, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	We propose the development of a CTE-matched, liquid-cooled, high thermal conductivity heat sink for use in spacecraft thermal management applications.  The material of construction of this heat sink has four properties that are critical: high normal and specific thermal conductivities, low CTE, high temperature resistivity, and moldability.  Its thermal conductivities are higher than that of copper, so the thermal resistance across this heat sink will be lower than one made of copper.  At the same time, it has a low CTE, which is slightly less than silicon and close to the CTE?s of most semiconductor and optical materials.  CTE-matching is critical in space applications because of the wide variations in ambient temperatures, which can lead to delamination of heat sinks from electronics or their fracture.  This material can withstand very high temperatures, so a faster CVD diamond deposition process is feasible.  The diamond layer maximizes the thermal spreading at the heat sink-device interface (important for devices that are sensitive to temperature gradients) and also provides electrical isolation of the electrical components being cooled.  Finally, the material is moldable, so heat sinks with complex external geometries, e.g. curved for optics, and internal surfaces can be fabricated inexpensively.	12773

Milliwatt Radioisotope Stirling Convertor, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	Sest, xxxxxx. proposes to perform a detailed evaluation at the both convertor and component levels of a small, low electrical output power (50 to 500 mW) xxxxxx cycle based convertor utilizing light weight radioisotope heater units (LWRHU) as the heat source. The proposed milliwatt radioisotope xxxxxx convertor (MRSC) will be optimized for output power with source temperatures in the range of 480 to 560 oK so as to provide electric power at convertor efficiencies in the range of 15 to 20% and sized to make maximum use of the existing LWRHU heat source. These efficiency levels are on the order of 2 to 4 times those of thermoelectric conversion systems. The evaluation processes will incorporate an in-depth evaluation of the structural materials and fabrications techniques required to maximize convertor specific power while at the same time insuring high reliability and long operating life. Due to the unique operating characteristics of convertors of this size a proof of concept linear alternator will be developed and tested during xxxxxx At the completion of the proposed xxxxxx I effort a specific final configuration for the detailed hardware design and fabrication in the xxxxxx effort will be fully defined.   In addition a scaling study will be performed identify optimal configurations over the entire power range of interest.	12775
In Situ Metrology for the Corrective Polishing of Replicating Mandrels, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	"The International xxxxxx observatory (IXO) is due to be launched in 2021. The core of the instrument is a very large (3.2 meter diameter) xxxxxx I optic, to be assembled from approximately 13,000 individual elements.  Each element will, in turn, be created by 'slumping' glass over a precision mandrel, of which there must be in excess of 700.  Inaddition to the very large size of the mandrels (up to 1.6 meter radius), figure and size tolerances are exceedingly tight, ranging from 2 nanometers (axial figure) to 200 nanometers (radius variation).  The combination of size, accuracies, production rate requirements and the number of individual component designs defy standard optical metrology techniques.While polishing equipment that can meet these tolerances exists, the polishers must be controlled by continuous or near continuous (process intermittent) feedback.  In this effort we propose to develop a unique \"point-defined\" metrology instrument that can be incorporated into the polishing machine itself, to control the manufacturing process to the required levels of accuracy.  In xxxxxx we will develop conceptual designs for both stand-alone and on-machine instrumentation.  In xxxxxx 2 we will develop a stand-alone metrology instrument, and in xxxxxx 3 we will fully incorporate the technology onto a commercial polishing instrument."	12776

Doppler Wind Lidar Measurements and Scalability to Space	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx measurements of wind speed and direction from xxxxxx wind  lidars, if available, would significantly improve forecasting of  severe weather events such as hurricanes, severe thunderstorms,  volcanic plume transport, and smoke from wildfires. xxxxxx wind lidar  have been successfully demonstrated on the ground and on aircraft, but  the scanning telescopes traditionally used for xxxxxx wind lidars are  too large and complex for operation in space. The xxxxxx xxxxxx-xxxxxx Transport xxxxxx (ACATS) is a high  spectral resolution lidar (HSRL) and xxxxxx wind lidar instrument  managed at GSFC that flies on the high-altitude xxxxxx ER-2 aircraft.  ACATS is one of only two airborne xxxxxx wind lidar instruments  developed and maintained at GSFC, and it is the only one that provides  simultaneous measurements of cloud/aerosol properties and wind  speed/direction within these layers. The performance of both wind and  HSRL measurements was impeded by poor instrument calibration during  previous flights. Previous work has resulted in improved instrument  calibration and extinction measurements within cloud and aerosols  layers. This project will enable testing and modifications to the  receiver subsystem and/or instrument software to improve the quality  of wind measurements from ACATS, and will also support the exploration  of a new innovative telescope design that is scalable to space.The objectives of this project are as follows:  xxxxxx how ACATS calibration improvements have impacted the    accuracy of the wind measurements.

The  tasks that will be completed to achieve the goals of this project are  as follows:  Test ACATS line-of-sight (LOS) wind measurements from the ground    at GSFC and compare to nearby radiosonde data to determine accuracy    with the new calibration technique.  xxxxxx the ACATS receiver subsystem and instrument software as    necessary to further improve the accuracy of wind measurements.  Work with external “think-tank” engineers to explore an innovative    telescope concept for a space-based wind lidar mission.These tasks will ensure that this proposal’s overall goals of  readying ACATS for future field campaigns and demonstrating its  scalability to space are met.	12778

Rotorcraft Diagnostics, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Under this xxxxxx program, xxxxxx will introduce the first low-cost, low-power, and lightweight data monitoring solution for rotorcraft diagnostics. The solution is an integrated MEMS-based sensors fabricated by a MEMS-first CMOS process methodology. The device measures temperature, shock, and vibration from multiple sensors integrated onto a single substrate that also contains submicron-scale CMOS electronics for the associated readout and data storage functions. High-sensitivity MEMS structures will be developed, and associated sense amplifiers that exploit low power transistors biased to operate in the subthreshold regions will be introduced. Further scaling in power is achieved by leveraging ultra-small geometries available in modern processes (e.g., 130 nm minimum feature length and below).	12780
Compact High-Resolution, Time-Resolved Intensified Image Sensor, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	In situ planetary instruments face challenges that greatly exceed even the challenges of developing in-space xxxxxxorbiting instruments. Because of restricted payload masses for these ambitious missions, planetary in situ instruments must be very small (a few kg, at most), consume low power (20W or less), take up low volume (a few liters, at most), and be highly automated from instrument turn-on to data transmission. To address this need, a compact improvement on time-resolved streak-tube and intensified photodiode (IPD) technology will be developed that is better at achieving the sensitivity, resolution, and count rates. The proposed hybrid intensified solid-state pixelated anode detector (ISPAD) senses and timestamps microchannel-plate (MCP) -multiplied electron clouds at picosecond time scales, allowing photon detection with subpixel spatial resolution, at rates ranging from a few counts per second to billions of counts per second. In xxxxxx I, a solid-state multi-anode readout circuit, optimized for operation in an MCP image tube, will be designed and simulated. After updating the engineering requirements control document, a complete layout, extraction, and simulation of the pixel elements will be performed. A vacuum header will be designed, and the process of integrating the tube body with the photocathode will be established. A preliminary design review (PDR) with xxxxxx technical monitors, instrument designers, scientists, and other stakeholders will then be conducted.	12781
Radiation Pressure on Tunable Optical Metamaterials for Propulsion and Steering without Moving Parts	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	Just as wind can exert a pressure on a sail to propel a sailboat, light too can exert a pressure on a reflective object. This radiation pressure can be used to propel small spacecrafts and is the working principle behind solar sails. xxxxxxver, in order to steer the craft, movable mechanical structures are usually needed, which is a major limitation due to added bulk and weight. In contrast to these traditional solar sails, we will use of a thin film optical metamaterial, composed of sub-wavelength resonant structures, which is capable of changing, in real-time, the optical properties of the device locally. This allows for active control of the resulting photon pressure and hence the ability to steer without the need for mechanically movable parts. In addition, by measuring the photon pressure, we will further illuminate the true nature of photon momentum—a controversy dating back to the early 1900s. We will determine the frequency dependence of the radiation pressure on a variety of materials (traditional dielectrics, traditional metals, and nano- and micro-structured metamaterials) using a cantilever-based setup.	12782
Cryogenic Ice Penetration Mechanics for Investigating the Existence of Life on the Jupiter Moon Europa	2013-10-01	2018-07-19	The innovation described in this proposal is a concept for an instrumented penetrator that can be impacted deep into the surface of xxxxxx and record and transmit data to an orbiter. The data would allow a much better understanding of the chemical composition of xxxxxx, conditions in the ice and the water layer below, whether those conditions can support life, and possibly even confirm the existence of life. A penetrator would be a much less costly option than a lander.  A key challenge is that ice properties at the temperatures that exist on xxxxxx are not well characterized. Our previous studies have shown that hardness as well as dynamic strength of ice increases rapidly with decreasing temperature. Specifically, current models for dynamic mechanical behavior of ice including fracture and fragmentation have difficulty in handling the extreme low temperature regime, because of the coupling between massive failure processes, strength, energetics and dynamics. We propose to address this regime: understanding this regime will enable development of robust and predictive penetration models for deep ice, that will enable the design of a penetrator.	12783
Microwave Enhanced Freeze Drying of Solid Waste, Phase II	2006-11-01	2018-07-19	The development of advanced methods for xxxxxx Enhanced Freeze xxxxxxing of xxxxxx xxxxxx (MEFDSW) is proposed.  xxxxxx for the recovery of relatively pure water as a byproduct of freeze drying will also be fully developed. xxxxxx project will result in the design, assembly, thorough testing, and delivery of a technology demonstrator prototype which may be employed over a broad range of mission scenarios.  The prototype system will recover water initially contained within the wastes and stabilize the residue with respect to microbial growth.  The dry waste may then be safely stored or passed on to the next solid waste treatment process.  Using microwave power in a closed microwave cavity, water-ice present in the frozen solid waste can be selectively and rapidly heated. This results in a more energy efficient lyophilization process, and therefore hardware based upon this technology will have a lower xxxxxx xxxxxx (ESM) than currently available systems.	12784
Miniature Mass Spectrometer for Earth Science Research, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	By drastically reducing the physical footprint of a mass spectrometer to the size of a beverage can, Ceramitron could set a new performance/price standard in the miniaturized MS market.  To do this, we propose eliminating the turbomolecular and roughing pumps in favor two chemical sorption pumps (a non-evaporable getter (NEG) and an ion pump), both integrated into the spectrometer's self-contained vacuum enclosure.  Ceramitron's patented double-focusing 90o magnetic-sector unit comprises three printed circuit boards, sandwiched together to form a vacuum-tight enclosure containing a dual-filament EI source, ion slits, a photo- lithographically-deposited energy analyzer, lenses and I/O pins, continuous-dynode electron multiplier and the sorption pumps.xxxxxx parameters: 200 daltons mass range, 200 resolving power, 5x10-5 Amps/xxxxxx sensitivity, <2kg total weight, <10 watts power consumption.

Internal pumps maintain ~1E-6 xxxxxx with no in-flow.  xxxxxxs will be optimized for harsh operating environments.	12785
Fast Solar Sailing for Solar System Exploration	2015-10-01	2018-07-19	"Practical spinning solar sails will be needed for the most demanding and scientifically compelling solar sail missions of the future. The \"heliogyro\" is potentially the most feasible high-performance spinning architecture, although technology readiness is very low and deployment and flight dynamics are impossible to validate on the ground.  A pathway towards an affordable flight demonstration of a practical heliogyro spinning solar sail will be required to realize the full potential of solar sailing for solar system exploration and science missions. The \"HELIOS\" heliogyro solar sail concept, developed as part of this project, has a theoretical characteristic acceleration performance 5 to 10 times that achievable with current in-space propulsion technologies.  This is sufficient to provide a lower-cost alternative to long-duration solar electric propulsion missions. xxxxxx where practical, heliogyro solar sail technology would be enabling or significantly enhancing include space weather solar storm early warning sentinels, multiple-NEO rendezvous human exploration precursor missions, pole sitters for terrestrial and lunar communications relays, xxxxxxxxxxxx cargo conveyors for supply prepositioning, and asteroid deflection missions.  These \"fast\" heliogyro solar sails would also enable many space science missions that are impossible to perform with chemical or electric propulsion.  These include high-inclination solar polar imaging spacecraft, inner solar system sun-synchronous orbiters, xxxxxx belt fly-throughs, and interstellar probes. "	12786

Runtime Assurance for Flight Test Research Aircraft, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	Barron Associates proposes to develop a runtime assurance (RTA) system that provides in-flight protection to research aircraft that are flight testing advanced or experimental controllers.  The RTA system monitors key critical parameters to determine if errors in the experimental controller are potentially driving the vehicle to unsafe flight conditions.  If such conditions are ensuing, the RTA system activates mitigation strategies to bring the aircraft back to a safe state.  The main efforts in xxxxxx I are: (1) develop the RTA system in a desktop simulation environment using a challenge problem with a specific advanced control system applied to a specific flight test vehicle that is of interest to xxxxxx, (2) integrate the RTA system into a xxxxxx flight test experiment processing environment, (3) generalize the RTA design approach, and (4) prepare for SUAS xxxxxx flight tests by designing a flight test article and flight test experiment plan.

Safety Analysis For Evaluating (SAFE) sUAS, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	The primary goal of Air Traffic Management systems is to ensure safety of operations, in the air and on the ground. While they system have served xxxxxx (NAS) well over the years, the imminent introduction of xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxs (UASs) poses a serious challenge. The variety, flexibility and accessibility of UASs ensures high demand for their use. The low-altitude, small-UAS (sUAS) are perhaps the most attractive platforms due to the low cost to own and maintain. These aircraft pose unique safety risks that are very different from other manned and unmanned aircraft.  To address these risks Intelligent Automation, xxxxxx. (IAI) along with its subcontractor xxxxxx xxxxxxersity propose to develop higher fidelity sUAS xxxxxx (sUTG) tool for Small UASs. The tool is capable of modeling rotorcraft, fixed wind and hybrid sUAS while accounting for the impacts of winds and sensor uncertainty. The model architecture allows for the use of high fidelity 6-DOF data augmented by flight plan data. The lack of credible trajectory model for sUASs is sorely required for improved mission designs, safety analyses, contingency management and NAS performance estimation.  This effort is a step in this direction.	12790
Nanotube Adsorption for the Capture and Re-liquefaction of Hydrogen Biol-Off During Tanker Transfer Operations, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	This proposal discloses an innovative, economically feasible technique to capture and re-liquefy the hydrogen boil-off by using carbon nanotube adsorption prior to liquefaction.  The hydrogen boil- off involves an average of 10,300 SCFM of hydrogen vapor at pressures below 17 psia for a period of an hour.  The configuration disclosed in the proposal significantly reduces the size of the liquefaction equipment and this translates into a substantial reduction in cost for the system.

Highly Efficient, Solid State Hydrogen Purification for Resource Recovery, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx signature electrochemical cell architecture provides a solution to xxxxxx search for regenerative separation technology enabling maximum hydrogen recovery from a stream containing water vapor (saturated), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbons including methane, acetylene, ethane, and ethylene, among others. Separation of hydrogen from mixed gaseous streams presents a significant technical challenge for various xxxxxx applications. In addition, the ability to efficiently perform hydrogen purification presents an attractive economic opportunity.  xxxxxx is developing a technology that extracts hydrogen from a mixed stream by electro-oxidization of the hydrogen and subsequent electro-reduction of the resultant protons in a separate chamber.  The process, when combined with an electrochemical cell architecture that is engineered to tolerate high differential pressure, can be used to separate and compress hydrogen in a single step.  The process is proven to be efficient, quiet, and highly reliable.  It requires no reciprocating compressor, so it is largely maintenance free.	12793
Small Form Factor RFID Applicator, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	The proposed development of a small form factor xxxxxx dedicated RFID label applicator will allow current and future free flying vehicles to place RFID labels assisting in logistics and asset tracking. Metis xxxxxx xxxxxxutions proposes the development of an RFID label applicator designed to fulfill the xxxxxx operational requirements, payload interface requirements, as well as satisfy JSC PSRP requirements for safety. The unit is designed to have a replaceable cartridge with 100 Alien Technologies ALN-9640 Higgs-3 RFID labels. Operationally the unit is first installed, xxxxxx then propels and aligns the vehicle to the target asset/surface to be labeled once there a pitch maneuver aligns the label applicator with the assistance of integrated cameras. The unit then exerts a thrust force on the target as the applicator quickly applies the adhesive backed RFID label.

A Multipurpose Fruit and Vegetable Processing System for Advanced Life Support	2007-01-01	2018-07-19	During the one-year no-cost extension, we completed the fabrication of the multipurpose fruit and vegetable food processor (MFVP) and the remaining trials with its components. In addition, we conducted a comprehensive study to obtain data on using electrolyzed water for cleaning-in-place (CIP) of the MFVP. CIP with electrolyzed water is an attractive option for cleaning as it does not require detergents (caustic solution) or disinfectants (chlorine). Therefore it could be more suitable for application in a controlled environment system. xxxxxxlyzed water is generated from salt mixed in water. We conducted trials with a stainless steel test-bed containing various components used in the MFVP. The cleaning and disinfection of the components after inoculation was validated with microbial testing. Specifically, the effectiveness of electrolyzed oxidizing water (EOW) and electrolyzed reducing water (ERW) used in clean-in-place (CIP) applications for MFVP were studied using 38 mm (1.5 in) diameter stainless steel (SS316L) pipes fouled with apple juice. xxxxxx were compared with industrial CIP cleaner (chlorinated NaOH) and antimicrobial solution (mixture of peroxyacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide). Cleanliness of stainless steel (SS) pipe surfaces was quantified by a hygiene monitoring test and aerobic plate count. xxxxxx were obtained to determine the removal of organic debris and microorganisms at 5, 10, 15, and 20 min washing using electrolyzed water and industrial cleaning chemicals. xxxxxxlyzed water showed potential use in CIP applications--it is easy to use and less hazardous compared to the industrial cleaning chemicals. xxxxxxbiological evaluation showed 5 min cleaning with EOW followed by 5 min cleaning with ERW was sufficient to drop cell levels from 5.2&plusmn;0.3 log CFU (colony forming units)/stainless steel chip to below the limit of detection (&lt;0.69 log CFU/cm2). In contrast, in case of bioluminescence tests, there were detectable adenosine triphosphate (ATP) even after 15 min of cleaning, even though the system was microbiologically at below detection. Furthermore, bioluminescence tests revealed that industrial cleaning chemicals were faster in cleaning compared to electrolyzed water. xxxxxxlyzed water needs to be circulated more than 20 min at 0.6 m/s (2 ft/s) flow velocity to achieve acceptable cleaning, whereas industrial cleaning takes only 5 min of circulation for acceptable cleaning based on the bioluminescence readings.	12796
High-Performance Airborne Optical Carbon Dioxide Analyzer, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	Environmental species measurement on airborne atmospheric research craft is a demanding application for optical sensing techniques.  Yet optical techniques offer many advantages including high-precision, fast response, and high species selectivity.  xxxxxx, kite, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or glider deployment demands that sensors meet stringent size, weight and power requirements.  Few measurements are as important, and none have entered into the public consciousness, like the need to quantify global carbon dioxide loading.  Vista Photonics proposes to develop rugged, compact, power efficient optical sensor technology capable of selectively measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide with precision that rivals ground based instruments.  The enabling technology for meeting stringent xxxxxx mission requirements is a newly emergent infrared laser source that delivers the high-sensitivity of established optical absorption detection techniques with extreme compactness and low power draw.	12797

High Sensitivity Semiconductor Sensor Skins for Multi-Axis Surface Pressure Characterization, Phase II	2018-04-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx program would fabricate high sensitivity semiconductor nanomembrane 'sensor skins' capable of multi-axis surface pressure characterization on flight test vehicles, wind tunnel models as well as operational aerospace vehicles, using SOI (xxxxxx on Insulator) NM techniques in combination with our pioneering HybridSil nanocomposite materials. Such low-modulus, conformal nanomembrane sensor skins with integrated interconnect elements and electronic devices can be applied to new or existing wind tunnel models for multi-axis surface pressure analysis, or to lightweight UAVs as part of active flutter control systems. xxxxxxSonic has demonstrated the feasibility of NM transducer materials in such sensor skins for the measurement of dynamic shear stress and normal pressure. Semiconductor NM sensor skins are thin, mechanically and chemically robust materials that may be patterned in two dimensions to create multi-sensor element arrays that can be embedded into small probe tips or conformally attached onto vehicle and model surfaces. xxxxxxs may be connected to external support instrumentation either through thin film and ribbon cable interconnects, or potentially wirelessly using RF communication directly from electronic networks incorporated into the sensor skin material.	12801
Physics of Failure Models for Capacitor Degradation in DC-DC Converters	2013-05-09	2018-07-19	This paper proposes a combined energy-based model with an empirical physics of failure model for degradation analysis and prognosis of electrolytic capacitors in xxxxxx power converters. xxxxxxlytic capacitors and MOSFET’s have higher failure rates than other components in xxxxxx converter systems. For example, in avionics systems where the power supply drives a GPS unit, ripple currents can cause glitches in the GPS position and velocity output, and this may cause errors in the Inertial Navigation (INAV) system causing the aircraft to fly off course. We have employed a topological energy based modeling scheme based on the bond graph (BG) modeling language for building parametric models of electrical domain systems. Our current work adopts a physics of failure model (Arrhenius xxxxxx) for equivalent series resistance (ESR) increase in electrolytic capacitors subjected to electrical and thermal stresses. Experiments for capacitor degradation were conducted for collecting degradation ESR data. xxxxxx re-estimation for the failure model is done using the experimental data. The derived degradation model of the capacitor is reintroduced into xxxxxx converter system model to study changes in the system performance using xxxxxx simulation methods. Stochastic simulation methods applied to the combined model help us predict how system performance deteriorates with time.	12802

Non-Parametric, Closed-Loop Testing of Autonomy in Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	"The proposed xxxxxx I program aims to develop new methods to support safety testing for integration of xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxs into xxxxxx (NAS) with a particular focus on testing the collision avoidance (CA) algorithms of a UAS xxxxxx-and-xxxxxx (SAA) system.  The two primary issues addressed by this research are: (i) the risk that incorrect/mismatched modeling assumptions will skew simulation analyses and (ii) the fundamental difficulty of verifying the performance of autonomous systems that dynamically react to the environment.  In particular, this research program would develop novel methods for conducting non-parametric, closed-loop simulation testing of collision avoidance algorithms.  The technology generates a campaign of simulation experiments that automatically adapt to the algorithms in question. The purpose of this innovation is to expose potential vulnerabilities in UAS autonomy that are generated through the interaction of autonomous UAS algorithms with other agents such as an intruding aircraft operating under ``right of way rules\".

Efficient, Long-Life Biocidal Condenser, Phase II	2010-02-01	2018-07-19	Environmental control systems for manned lunar and planetary bases will require condensing heat exchangers to control humidity in manned modules.  Condensing surfaces must be hydrophilic to ensure efficient operation and biocidal to prevent growth of microbes in the moist, condensing environment.

Four-Mirror Freeform Reflective Imaging Systems	2020-08-01	2018-07-19	Central xxxxxxs: The research involves a revelation of the solution space for revolutionary families of four-mirror freeform reflective imaging systems. A freeform optical system is one that lacks rotational symmetry, meaning there is no constraint on the surface shape of the mirrors. Freeform designs can mitigate the disadvantages that prevent reflective systems from being used in larger field of view applications by yielding unobscured designs and leveraging the added freedom of surface shape to better correct the optical aberrations in the system. Freeform designs are made unobscured by breaking the axis of rotational-symmetry and tilting the individual elements themselves. They do not require an offset aperture or field bias, which brings a unique advantage in the correction of optical aberrations. By getting the mirrors out of their own way, more surfaces can be introduced. When compared to alternate solutions, whether it is a rotationally symmetric system or an unobscured system with the same number of elements, an increased diffraction-limited field of view has been demonstrated in our group's research.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx: The exploration of the solution space will be accomplished by expanding upon the work of xxxxxx, who derived the analytical solution space for four-mirror anastigmat telescopes. The systems that are yielded from his method have spherical surfaces and an axis of rotational symmetry. These designs will be used as starting points for subsequent freeform designs. Lens design software will be used to optimize the design as the elements are tilted. When tilting elements, very strong astigmatism is introduced. Therefore, toroidal base mirrors for the freeform surfaces are needed for correction. xxxxxx polynomials are then introduced to the toroidal base shapes to further correct the system. The research aims to explore a variety of targeted research questions that aim to address space technology challenges. The sensitivity of the designs from the solution space to common tolerances will be studied using full-field displays that isolate each aberration and show its dependence over the field, combined with Nodal Aberration Theory that puts tolerances in linear space, making the sensitivity calculation efficient and complete. Special attention will be paid to geometries that may be more conducive to stray light reduction through the use of baffles. Similarly, other geometries may be more conducive to radiation shielding by using the mirror substrates themselves as part of the shielding. The added flexibility of folding geometry allows for the design to be tailored to system engineering constraints that could not be addressed with rotationally symmetric systems or unobscured non-freeform systems. Design approaches to achieve these characteristics will be developed.Significance: This research will address xxxxxx interests as per the xxxxxxy 2015 technology roadmap item TA 8.2.1.3. A key, driving aspect of this work will be to focus on revealing key flat field Large, low cost, lightweight precision monolithic mirrors that provide a high degree of thermal and dynamic stability, and wavefront sensing and control for xxxxxx-Stable Large-Aperture UV/xxxxxxxxNear-IR telescopes. This research is directly relevant to the Observatories level 2 TABS element, 8.2. More specifically, it is relevant to the level 3 TABS element Mirror xxxxxxs. The significance of this work is to provide imaging system designs with larger diffraction-limited etendues than the state-of-the-art, (meaning larger apertures and fields of view), which will make the most of limited package sizes and mass constraints. This will advance the optical instrumentation on space probes as well as observatories on the ground towards new space discoveries and knowledge.	12815
Silent and Efficient Supersonic Bi-Directional Flying Wing	2013-06-01	2018-07-19	We propose a xxxxxx I study for a novel concept of a supersonic bi-directional (xxxxxx) flying wing (FW) that has the potential to revolutionize supersonic flight with virtually zero sonic boom and ultra-high aerodynamic efficiency. The xxxxxx-FW planform is symmetric about both the longitudinal and span axes. For supersonic flight, the planform can have as low aspect ratio and as high sweep angle as desired to minimize wave drag and sonic boom. For subsonic mode, the airplane will rotate 90deg in flight to achieve superior stable aerodynamic performance. The conflict of subsonic and supersonic aerodynamic performance of conventional fuselage-wing configuration is hence removed. The preliminary CFD simulation for a xxxxxx-FW business jet (BJ) at xxxxxx numbers of 1.6 and 2.0 indicates that the configuration generates no N-wave sonic boom on the ground at a high lift to pressure drag ratio L/Dp of 16. The superior supersonic aerodynamic performance is benefited from the sharp nose and ultra-slender body with a low aspect ratio of 0.33, which translates to a very high subsonic aspect ratio of 33 for high subsonic performance. This proposal has three objectives: 1) design refinement of a supersonic xxxxxx-FW BJ configuration using CFD; 2) mission analysis assisted with CFD simulation for the supersonic xxxxxx-FW BJ to study the feasibility; and 3) wind tunnel testing of the SbiDir-FW BJ to verify its supersonic aerodynamic performance and sonic boom signature. The research team is highly qualified to perform the proposed tasks.	12816

Passive Wireless Cryogenic Liquid Level Sensors Using Orthogonal Frequency Coded Acoustic Wave Devices, Phase II	2009-08-01	2018-07-19	This proposal describes the continued development of passive wireless surface acoustic wave (SAW) based liquid level sensors for xxxxxx application to cryogenic liquid level sensing.  Orthogonal Frequency Coded (OFC) SAW devices have been demonstrated as passive wireless temperature sensors in xxxxxx Contract NNK04OA28C, and are being further developed under NNK05OB31C.  The liquid level sensors use damping of the acoustic wave caused by mass loading of the liquid to produce fast, reversible liquid level sensors.  The xxxxxx I research successfully demonstrated operation of these devices as liquid level sensors in selected liquids of interest at cryogenic temperatures.  Stability of selected commercially available SAW devices was confirmed, both when exposed to various (extreme and gradual) temperature changes, and upon repeated exposure to liquid nitrogen.  The reversibility of the device response was confirmed. xxxxxx I demonstrated the technical feasibility of using these sensors for cryogenic liquid level monitoring of low to moderate pressure liquids (under 500 psi).  xxxxxx will result in prototype product development.	12820
Modified Collins Cryocooler for Cryo-Propellant Thermal Management, Phase I	2009-01-01	2018-07-19	Future lunar and planetary explorations will require the storage of cryogenic propellants, particularly liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (xxxxxx), in low earth orbit (LEO) for periods of time ranging from days to months, and possibly longer.  LEO is a relatively warm thermal environment and without careful thermal management, significant quantities of stored liquid cryogens can be lost due to boil-off.  This requires that larger volumes of cryogenic fuels must be launched into orbit so that sufficient quantities are available to satisfy the mission propulsion requirements.  It has been shown that active cooling using space cryocoolers has the potential to result in xxxxxx (ZBO) of stored cryogens.  The launch-mass savings using active cooling exceeds that of passive cooling of LOX for mission durations in LEO of less than 1 week.  The savings advantage of active cooling for xxxxxx begins after about 2 months in LEO.  The proposer is developing a xxxxxx Collins xxxxxxcooler that offers the potential for higher efficiency cooling with better system integration for ZBO storage than can be provided by xxxxxx or pulse-tube type cryocoolers.	12821

Next generation global Earth atmospheric composition sounders for the decadal survey requirements and roadmaps	2017-10-01	2018-07-19	"This task follows directly from an \"A xxxxxx\" study conducted in April 2013 to identify the future space based atmospheric composition measurements required to inform future climate and air quality research, public policy, and air quality forecasting following the completion of the xxxxxx and Aura missions.  A group of representatives from across the atmospheric composition community at JPL participated and of the concepts proposed, the most compelling and tractable investigations – 1. developing a predictive capability for global tropospheric ozone and 2. understanding the impact of changing water vapor concentrations in the stratosphere and upper troposphere on climate -- were selected for further study through this program as promising topics around which to base a future xxxxxx Decadal Survey mission. This three-year effort to develop measurement requirements for future global atmospheric composition observations needed to provide a quantitative understanding of key processes affecting atmospheric composition and its impact on climate. We further propose to advance the technology of specific low-cost instrument concepts that are suited to deliver these measurements, namely: a simplified microwave limb sounder and, depending on the results of the first year's study, either an immersed grating or xxxxxx transform spectrometer (FTS).  This project will lead to the generation of one or more \"white papers\" to be submitted to the upcoming Earth science decadal survey.  These will make the scientific case for the measurements and outline mission concepts for delivering the required measurements with mature technology at modest cost. There are two overall objectives: 1. xxxxxx the spatial resolutions and sensitivities required for the instruments; 2. Mature the technology for the limb sounder and the selected spectrometer. Work in the first year is focused on strengthening the case for the observations and establishing requirements for spatial resolution.  The resolution study in turn dictates the preferred implementation route for the short wave infrared (xxxxxx) and thermal infrared (TIR) observations (interferometer vs. grating spectrometer). Work in the second and third years centers on technology maturation for the infrared and limb microwave sensors. "	12823
Ultrasensitive Airborne Formaldehyde Monitor, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	This Small Business xxxxxxovative xxxxxxearch xxxxxx I proposal seeks to develop an ultrasensitive, mid-infrared laser-based formaldehyde gas sensor system for airborne and ground-based atmospheric monitoring. The proposed instrument will be capable of accurately determining sub-parts-per-billion formaldehyde concentrations in seconds.  This compact, lightweight instrument will be capable of long-term autonomous operation, and require minimal power.

Rapid Estimation of Aircraft Performance Models using Differential Vortex Panel Method and Extended Kalman Filter, Phase II	2010-12-01	2018-07-19	The problem of estimating the aerodynamic models for flight control of damaged aircraft using an innovative differential vortex lattice method tightly coupled with an extended xxxxxx filter was investigated during the xxxxxx I research.  The approach exploited prior knowledge about the undamaged aircraft to reduce the order of the estimation problem. Probing maneuvers were designed to improve the observability of the system dynamics. The derived performance model was then be used to determine the aircraft flight envelope, performance parameters and the maneuver limits. The estimated data can be used as the basis for designing safe landing guidance laws for damaged aircraft.   xxxxxx research will refine the algorithms developed during the xxxxxx I research and create a standalone software implementation. Structural dynamic computations and control power estimation will be included in the software. Operation of the software will then be demonstrated at near real-time speeds. All the algorithms and software developed under the proposed research will be supplied to xxxxxx at the end of xxxxxx. Human-in-the-loop simulations and flight test evaluation of the system will be undertaken during the xxxxxx work.	12825
A Robust, Gravity-Insensitive, High-Temperature Condenser, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	Regenerative life support systems and in situ resource utilization systems are vital for xxxxxx future space exploration missions to maximize self-sufficiency and minimize the resupply of consumables.  One of the critical needs for these systems is a gravity-insensitive condenser to collect water in a high-temperature gas stream from these systems, as requested by Topic H03.3. To this end, Creare proposes to develop a gravity-insensitive, high-temperature condenser. The condenser has capillary structures to cool the gas stream, separate the condensate, and drain the liquid water.  The condenser has design features to ensure its operation is insensitive to gravity. The entire condenser is constructed from metals that have excellent resistance to chemical attack from contaminants and biofilm growth, and are suitable for operating at high temperature.  The capillary structures in the condenser are removable and can be regenerated during scheduled maintenance if it becomes necessary. The proposed condenser builds on the gravity-insensitive phase separator technology Creare developed for aircraft applications. In xxxxxx I, Creare will design, build, and demonstrate a proof-of-concept condenser. In xxxxxx, Creare will build and characterize a laboratory condenser for a specific target mission and deliver it to xxxxxx for further performance characterization.	12826
Peer-to-Peer Data Mining, Privacy Issues, and Games	2010-09-22	2018-07-19	xxxxxx-to-xxxxxx (P2P) networks are gaining increasing popularity in many distributed applications such as file-sharing, network storage, web caching, sear- ching and indexing of relevant documents and P2P network-threat analysis. Many of these applications require scalable analysis of data over a P2P network. This paper starts by offering a brief overview of distributed data mining applications and algorithms for P2P environments. Next it discusses some of the privacy concerns with P2P data mining and points out the problems of existing privacy-preserving multi-party data mining techniques. It further points out that most of the nice assumptions of these existing privacy preserving techniques fall apart in real-life applications of privacy-preserving distributed data mining (PPDM). The paper offers a more realistic formulation of the PPDM problem as a multi-party game and points out some recent results.	12827
High Temperature Superconductor Bolometers for Planetary Science	2017-09-01	2018-07-19	This work is a design study of an instrument optimized for JPL&#39;s novel high temperature superconductor bolometers. The work involves designing an imaging spectrometer that spans the infrared and offers capabilities in imaging and spectroscopy that are unprecedented for planetary science. The sensitivity and the use of passive cooling in the proposed far IR hyperspectral imager make this instrument a strong candidate for several missions to the outer xxxxxxar system proposed in xxxxxx: the Comet xxxxxx Sample xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and xxxxxx and xxxxxx. Furthermore, looking beyond this decade, the survey reads: &quot;it is important to make significant near-term technology investments in the [&hellip;] xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Mission, and xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx and xxxxxx.&quot; The high sensitivity of our instrument would allow resolving narrow and weak spectral features, acquiring spectra in short time windows (such as during brief flybys), and imaging fast dynamic processes (such as moving clouds or storms or during rapid flybys). When applied to observe storms in the atmospheres of the giant planets, our team expects our far IR hyperspectral imager to be able to acquire broadband images of storms in minutes, resolving chemical species at different depths to provide information about composition and depth with unprecedented detail. The proposed instrument may also be applied to measure thermophysical properties of icy moons (such as xxxxxx and xxxxxx), asteroids, and comets. xxxxxx include measuring temperature and thermal inertia to study geology and surface evolution while also performing spectroscopy to study composition of the surface of these objects and their thin atmospheres. Additionally, the ring particles of the giant planets are of interest. Thermal inertia measurements probe the ring dynamics. xxxxxxscopy using emission, solar reflectance, and stellar occultation measurements of ring particles probe composition. xxxxxx strongly emphasizes the exploration of the outer solar system, which addresses some of the basic questions of planetary science: &ldquo;How do the giant planets serve as laboratories to understand Earth, the solar system, and extrasolar planetary systems? Important objects for study: xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and xxxxxx.&rdquo;; &ldquo;Beyond Earth, are there contemporary habitats elsewhere in the solar system with necessary conditions, [&hellip;] to sustain life, and do organisms live there now? Important objects for study: xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and xxxxxx.&rdquo; One of the seven proposed xxxxxx missions (xxxxxx) aims at studying the atmosphere of xxxxxx and one of the three proposed large-scale xxxxxx mission (xxxxxx and xxxxxx) aims at studying the atmosphere of xxxxxx. Furthermore, looking beyond this decade, the survey reads: &quot;it is important to make significant near-term technology investments in the [&hellip;] xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Mission, and xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx and xxxxxx.&quot; The hyperspectral imager we envision would allow studying the atmospheres of xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, their moons and rings with higher spectral and spatial resolution than any other existing technology, and would also be applicable to studies of other outer solar system objects such as xxxxxx asteroids or comets. xxxxxx spectroscopy, as offered by the bolometers described below, is vital to studying the thick atmospheres of giant planets and moons because a wide range of wavelengths is needed for probing different depths into the atmosphere. The atmospheres of these bodies are opaque at shorter wavelengths due to the pressure-broadened absorption lines of H2 and He and, in some cases (e.g. xxxxxx and xxxxxx), methane. High spectral resolution optics, will allow for the probing of a wide range of depths, along with relevant spectroscopy of numerous molecular lines. For this reason, the composition of the atmosphere of the gas and ice giants and their moons has been studied by remote sensing using far infrared (FIR) thermal radiance spectroscopy. The hyperspectral imager we envision would allow studying the atmospheres of xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, their moons and rings with higher spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution than any other existing technology, and would also be applicable to studies of other outer solar system objects such as xxxxxx asteroids or comets and their thin atmospheres. The unprecedented high sensitivity of the superconducting bolometer technology instrument will allow capture dynamic phenomena or rapidly acquire image and spectra during brief flybys. The main features of the instrument we envision are: (1) broadband spectral range, potentially spanning from the visible (0.5 &mu;m) to the far infrared (500 &mu;m), (2) one hundred times higher sensitivity in the far infrared than existing radiometers, (3) ten times higher sensitivity than narrow band mid IR detectors, (4) potential for large (kilo pixel) arrays of detectors, and (5) operating temperature of 55 K or higher, accessible using a passive cooling, as deployed on the xxxxxx VIMS instrument. The high sensitivity of our instrument would allow: (1) resolving narrow and weak spectral features, (2) acquiring spectra in short time windows (such as during brief flybys), and (3) imaging fast dynamic processes, such as moving clouds or storms. The large spectral bandwidth of the instrument would allow acquiring hyperspectral images spanning three orders of magnitude in wavelength with the same focal plane, which avoids the problem of stitching together data acquired from different focal planes (as in VIMS and CIRS instruments on the CASSINI mission. The proposed instrument is based on arrays of yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) high temperature superconducting kinetic inductance bolometers (KIBs), which our team had recently pioneered. Each of these bolometers responds to power from the interferometer by shifting the microwave resonance frequency of a resonator in which it is embedded. Hundreds of resonators can be read out on a single feedline because each is assigned a frequency that is distinct from the others. Readout is performed by measuring the transmission of a microwave signal through the feedline. xxxxxx on the current performance of high temperature KIBs, we expect these detectors to: (1) operate at 55 K, a temperature that has already been attained by passive cooling on planetary flight missions; (2) be sensitive from the visible to the far infrared; (3) achieve 100 times higher sensitivity than existing detectors operating at comparable temperatures in the far IR; and (4) yield kilo pixel arrays, thanks to a resource efficient multiplexing scheme [8]. The development of the design involves laying out the optics to focus broadband infrared on an array of bolometers, while simultaneously achieving precision interferometry. This also requires optical coupling to the bolometers such as by use of a feedhorn array. A radiator and thermal design to cool the bolometers and optics to the required temperature are also being developed. The bolometer array design is being developed to match the optics. The design is being optimized to meet the power and mass requirements of a planetary mission. Together, these provide comprehensive design for the optical thermal systems of the instrument.	12828

Ultra High Energy Solid-State Batteries for Next Generation Space Power, Phase II	2017-05-01	2018-07-19	The use of lithium (Li) metal as an anode material has emerged as one highly attractive option for achieving high specific energy due to lithium having the highest capacity (3876 mAh g-1) of all potential anode materials. xxxxxxver, the reliable use of these exceptionally high capacity anodes in a commercial cell has not been achieved due to safety and reliability concerns resulting from thermal runaway and short-circuit issues due to dendritic growth on the metal anode from lithium plating during charge-discharge cycles. xxxxxx-state electrolytes (SSE) have been identified as one option to address this cell failure mode, but SSE technologies must be developed that combine high conductivity and mechanical properties conducive to smooth Li plating with feasible manufacturing processes. Also, xxxxxx anode must be combined with an ultra-high capacity cathode in order to reach xxxxxx aggressive cell-level energy goals. To address this need, xxxxxx xxxxxx proposes to utilize a Li-metal-compatible solid-state battery design to far exceed the specific energies achieved by state-of-the-art (SOTA) xxxxxx batteries in a format that also provides for intrinsic safety and abuse tolerance. xxxxxx I will demonstrate the feasibility of surpassing 600 Wh/kg and 1000 Wh/L at the cell level which will give a 3-5X improvement over the best battery technologies planned for xxxxxx missions today.	12831
Coatings for Fuel Cell Propulsion Compressor Bearings, Phase I	2006-01-01	2018-07-19	Fuel cell air handling systems require clean and contaminant-free inlet air, which dictates that oil-free, motorized, compressor/expander systems should be used.  xxxxxxhough there is no sliding contact in the steady state operation of the foil bearing, occasional contact between the foil and journal surfaces at startup and shutdown and during overload situations, could limit the bearing life.  Therefore, to ensure that the compressor system is highly efficient and reliable the foil air bearings need wear resistant, low friction coatings.  The objective of the proposed STTR investigation is to identify new coatings for use in fuel cell propulsion compressor bearings that would allow the foil bearing to be functional from low temperature start-up conditions to the maximum temperatures encountered during operation. The proposed program will build on a novel hydrogenated diamond like carbon (DLC) coating developed at the xxxxxxne xxxxxxoratory (ANL). The goal of this joint MiTiREG and ANL STTR xxxxxx I program is to demonstrate the feasibility of ANL hydrogenated DLC and MiTiREG KorolonTM coating technology for fuel cell propulsion compressor bearings.  This will be accomplished through coating adhesion and tribological testing of the coatings against various potential shaft coatings such as the xxxxxx developed xxxxxx and/or Korolon 1350B.	12832

Curved Microchannel Plates for Spaceflight Mass Spectrometers, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	This proposal will develop long, continuous, curved microchannel plates (MCPs) for use in spaceflight ion mass spectrometers. These instruments obtain ion mass in part by measuring the ion speed. Ions create secondary elections, first as they enter the instrument window, then as they ht a target. The flight time across the distance in between provides the speed. The time is measured by detecting secondary electrons from the window and then the target. Curved MCPs simplify the detection because: they have a cylindrical symmetry which is compatible with instrument fields of view; the MCP channels always have the same orientation to electron flight paths, and so create uniform azimuthal detection efficiency; and they may be placed close to the window and target, thereby improving time of flight and mass resolution. Curved MCPs will be developed starting with the successful xxxxxxom approach for flat MCPs. A glass capillary array is first formed with 20 micron pores. Using xxxxxx, the array is then coated with thin films that create the desired resistance and gain.	12834
Nanocomposite Thermolectric Materials by High Pressure Powder Consolidation Manufacturing, Phase II	2009-11-01	2018-07-19	In response to xxxxxx need to develop advanced nanostructured thermolectric materials, xxxxxxON is proposing an innovative high pressure powder consolidation manufacturing to fabricate near net shape and net shape thermolectric components with improved densification and properties than possible conventional powder metallurgical methods. Potential candidate materials such as Tellurides, TAGs and SiGe micro/nano composites will be developed at high compaction pressures (150 tsi) using select geometries/shapes and optimized disk samples will be characterized for geometrical, shrinkage, mechanical, microstructure/microchemistry and thermolectric properties. The proposed work has been planned in close subcontract/collaboration with Teledyne and Auburn xxxxxxersity-xxxxxxearch Institute.

Smartphone Video Guidance Sensor for Small Satellites	2012-09-01	2018-07-19	Smartphone Video xxxxxx xxxxxx(SVGS) for Small xxxxxxs will provide a low-cost,integrated rendezvous &amp; proximity operations sensor system to allow an approaching spacecraft to determine the position &amp; attitude of a target spacecraft.The target vehicle will carry an array of target retroreflectors.The SVGS will image targets using a smartphone-type camera;then process the image using photogrammetry techniques to determine the range &amp; relative orientation(6DOF)state of the target vehicle. The primary objectives of this proposal are the following: 1.Demonstrate a video guidance sensor system running on a smartphone platform that can perform proximity operations on any cubesat or microsat. 2.Raise the xxxxxx of the SVGS from xxxxxx 2 to 4 on the path to future development to xxxxxx 6 and ultimately a flight opportunity. 3.xxxxxx spacecraft component costs by demonstrating a COTS-based guidance sensor. 4.Further develop MSFC&rsquo;s small satellite development capabilities. Completion of this proposed work and subsequent development efforts to raise the xxxxxx to a flight-ready level would increase MSFC&rsquo;s foothold into the growing small satellite market with a low-cost subsystem well suited to formation flying and other proximity operations. The small satellite market opportunities include Department of Defense (DoD), academia, and industry-led efforts. Other than the general use of the SVGS technology in the small satellite market, this technology lends itself more specifically to formation flying applications. xxxxxxion flying allows smaller, simpler spacecraft to coordinate and perform more complex missions. The simpler designs of the individual spacecraft result in shorter development times and lower cost. Additionally, a formation of spacecraft may have greater redundancy and ability to adapt to failures. xxxxxxion flying can also take advantage of unique mission capabilities such as higher resolution imaging and the ability to collect observations from multiple look angles to enhance mission results. Potential applications of formation flying include astronomy, communications, meteorology, and earth observation. To date, formation flying of more than two spacecraft is not known to have been demonstrated. By placing the SVGS on a group of 3 or more low-cost cubesats, this sensor would allow for the demonstration of multi-spacecraft formation flying. We will leverage off of past technology developments from the xxxxxxanced Video xxxxxx xxxxxx(AVGS).	12836

A High Efficiency 30 K Cryocooler with Low Temperature Heat Sink, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	Future xxxxxx planetary science missions will incorporate detectors, sensors, shields, and telescopes that must be cooled to cryogenic temperatures.  These missions have very limited access to solar power and therefore reducing the cryocooling system power is more critical than for earth-orbiting satellites.  On this program, Creare proposes to develop and demonstrate an innovative xxxxxx cryocooler that efficiently produces refrigeration at 30 K and rejects heat at about 150 K.  A key component of the proposed cryocooler, its regenerator, will be optimized on this program  to obtain high efficiency over this operating temperature range.  The innovation is a regenerator fabricated by a unique process to enhance its heat capacity near its target cooling temperature and therefore increase the overall thermal efficiency of the cryocooler.  The proposed cryocooler is built on technologies developed for  commercial xxxxxx cryocoolers that are extremely compact and efficient while rejecting heat at 300 K.  In xxxxxx I, we will develop the regenerator fabrication process, measure the performance of a subscale regenerator under prototypical conditions, and optimize the cooler design for optimum performance.  In xxxxxx, we will fabricate full-size regenerators, characterize their performance, integrate a regenerator into a xxxxxx cooler, and optimize the cryocooler operating parameters to maximize its performance.  At the end of xxxxxx, we will deliver a cryocooler to xxxxxx for further performance characterization.	12838

A Nanotechnology Approach to Lightweight Multifunctional Polyethylene Composite Materials for Use Against the Space Environment, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx-based composite materials are under consideration as multifunctional structural materials, with the expectation that they can provide radiation shielding, micrometeorite shielding, and pressure containment during interplanetary missions. While ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is the hardest known thermoplastic, its impact strength and wear resistance still pale in comparison to many other known materials. We propose composites of UHMWPE with these materials, with the expected outcome of increasing its ability to perform as a micrometeorite shield.	12842

Such integration will fundamentally improve the size, weight, reliability and cost of terahertz receivers. Additionally, the integration of a newly available low noise MMIC amplifier at the front-end of the receiver will allow these improvements to be achieved with an overall reduction in the power requirements and an increase in receiver sensitivity.

Advanced Deposition Capability for Oxidation & Corrosion Protection Coatings, Phase I	2014-05-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx long range goals of reducing the fuel consumption by 30% and increasing fuel efficiency by 35% can be partially accomplished through increasing engine operation temperatures.  As a result, the disk section is desired to operate in increasingly higher temperatures, which will subject it to additional degradation mechanisms of oxidation and hot corrosion.  One approach to enhance the temperature capability of these systems is through the incorporation of environmental protective coatings which can provide resistance from oxidation and hot corrosion.  xxxxxxearch is proposed here to optimize the use of advanced coating manufacturing techniques designed to enable the affordable application of environmental protective coatings having enhanced resistance to hot corrosion and oxidation to allow operation at the desired high temperature engine environments.  xxxxxxanced testing conditions will be used to simulate real world conditions and demonstrate the performance of the deposited coatings in these conditions.  This approach is envisioned to aid the development of advanced coatings required to protect the surface of turbine disk components at higher temperatures desired for fuel and thrust operationally improvement without inducing significant fatigue debit.  xxxxxxanced coating systems will be applied in this work onto coupons, and subcomponents to demonstrate coating capability and allow simulated engine environment testing in follow on programs. Success in meeting the objectives will significantly aid the temperature capability of turbine disk components, allowing significant fuel efficiency and thrust increases for turbine engines.	12848
To Ensure the Integrity of the Cryogenic Propellant Depot Tank Within the Expected Radiation and Space Debris Environment, Phase II	2007-11-01	2018-07-19	"HyPerComp xxxxxxing, xxxxxx. (HEI) proposes to develop well characterized, structurally reliable filament wound composite pressure vessels for use in both cryogenic and radiation environment applications. The intent of the proposed effort is to develop the detailed pressure vessel performance characteristics that will result in \"off the shelf' technology for high performance cryogenic/ radiation environment composite pressure vessels. This intent will be achieved via empirical characterization of composite raw materials subsequent to exposure to the aforementioned environments.  xxxxxx I of this effort (xxxxxx contract #NNM05AA45C) demonstrated a significant reduction in structural performance subsequent to exposure to cryogenic/radiation environments.  This reduction in structural performance would seriously compromise the structural performance of any composite structure. The aerospace and the commercial communities have shown significant interest in using filament wound composite pressure vessels for cryogenic applications.  In addition there is serious consideration for using composite vessels in deep space exploration which would sustain significant radiation exposure. The xxxxxx I investigation has shown that these environments significantly degrade the structural capability of these vessels.  Constituent raw materials and existing pressure vessel designs have not been characterized for these applications and as such the safety margins for these applications are undefined.  Therefore, the reliability of such usage is unknown.  HEI has recently completed a xxxxxx I xxxxxx through xxxxxx/MSFC.  This successful effort demonstrated a significant degradation in composite pressure vessel cryogenic/radiation performance.  The effort proposed herein builds upon that knowledge, significantly expands it, and will result in statistically meaningful and, therefore, reliable \"off the shelf\" technology for composite pressure vessels in cryogenic/radiation applications."	12849
Lunar EVA Dosimetry: Design of a Radiation Dosimeter for Astronauts During Lunar Extravehicular Activities	2011-10-01	2018-07-19	Task 1: Design, Fabrication, and xxxxxx Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counters (TEPC) xxxxxxors The purpose of this task was to design, build, and assemble a prototype Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counters (TEPC) that would satisfy the basic specifications outlined by xxxxxx for a dosimeter for astronauts during lunar EVAs (extravehicular activities) and as area monitors in space craft and habitats. The spherical TEPC is based on a single-wire anode with recessed guard ring insulators to shape the electric field near the poles. The diameter of the gas cavity is 18 mm and the wall thickness is 3 mm for a total diameter of 24 mm (~1 inch). xxxxxx vacuum chambers with a shell thickness of 0.5 mm were designed and gold plated to maintain electrical conductivity. A system using a high sensitivity mass spectrometer was assembled to measure vacuum leaks for the assembled detectors with high special specificity. We have been using a version of the software package LORENTZ 3D to model the electric field inside a spherical detector with a linear collector. This uses special modeling techniques based on the Boundary Element xxxxxx to make the solution of these very challenging problems a simple matter. The geometry of the problem can be created with the geometric modeler built into the electric field solvers or can be imported from any of the major CAD (computer-aided design) vendors. More importantly, the geometry can be changed parametrically to optimize a design for robustness, weight, size and, of course, cost. We have fabricated seven versions of the TEPC and xxxxxx Chamber. Three versions with spherical detector and single wire anode operated with the wall at high voltage and the anode at ground were delivered for electronics development and testing. Two versions with a spherical detector and single wire anode operated with the wall at ground and the anode at high voltage have been used for TEPC development and comparative analysis. Two versions of a detector using a new hybrid design with a parallel wire grid surrounding the anode we designed and built. The objective of this design was to form a virtual cylindrical geometry around the anode with that would improve the spatial resolution of the TEPC without distorting the signals required for microdosimetry applications. The single and multi wire detectors with grounded anodes were exposed to xxxxxx from a PuBe source at xxxxxx State xxxxxxersity and high energy charged particle beams at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in xxxxxx (HIMAC) synchrotron in xxxxxx xxxxxx and the xxxxxx xxxxxx Radiation xxxxxx (NSRL) at xxxxxxhaven xxxxxxoratory. This included the following ions and energies: 56Fe (380 MeV/amu), 18Ar (300 MeV/amu), 12C (200 MeV/amu), and 1H (230 MeV/amu). Measurements were taken at several angles of incidence to determine the angular response of the detector. These results were compared with similar measurements using a commercial TEPC with a xxxxxx design that has a helical grid surrounding the anode to provide a uniform angular response. xxxxxx of detector response using digital signal processing was initiated. This system replaced a preamplifier and shaping amplifier with a programmable logic device (PLD) that captures the output signal from the TEPC and digitizes the amplitude in 10 nsec intervals. Task 2: xxxxxx xxxxxxor xxxxxx The objective of this task is to determine the response of the TEPC under ambient conditions and during solar particle events (SPE) on the lunar surface. Computations using the xxxxxx Code PHITS have been made to determine the energy deposition in the TEPC using protons with an energy spectrum from a SPE in October 2003. These data were compared with the dose that would be delivered to the skin beneath a space suit with an areal density of 0.4 g/cm2. It is clear that a stainless steel vacuum chamber in Mod 1 needs to be replaced with lighter and thinner materials. These results will be important in determining what additional modifications will be necessary to achieve the design goal for real time measurements to the skin and blood forming organs (BFO). Task 3: xxxxxx the Variance-Covariance xxxxxx The original proposal for the EVA dosimeter was based on the concept of having two independent proportional counters that would be used to obtain estimates of dose, D, and a quality factor, Q, based on estimating using the variance-covariance method. It was recognized that because of size limitations, the proportional counters would have to be located too close to one another to satisfy the condition that a single particle could not intercept both detectors. The additional constraint that one of the detectors must measure the dose at the skin surface and the other at a depth corresponding to the blood forming organs, makes the original variance-covariance method with paired detectors impractical. We have developed a method using a single detector in a variance-covariance scheme. The concepts are based on collecting the charge, q(i), in a single TEPC for n successive time intervals, i. The method proposed by Borak at xxxxxx State xxxxxxersity (CSU) separates the data set into two groups of n/2 entries of values for q(i) based on odd and even indices. The n/2 pairs of data (odd and even) are used to obtain the covariance and each of the two sets of n/2 values (odd or even) to estimate a variance. xxxxxx codes have been written to test the algorithmic using microdosimetric spectra obtained from measurements in Task 1. The tests indicated that if the change in dose rate between successive intervals was less than 1%, the single detector scheme provided reliable estimated dose rate and dose averaged lineal energy for estimating quality factors. The analysis also indicated that the estimate of dose mean lineal energy for high energy heavy ions (HZE) and recoil protons from PuBe neutrons converged to the correct value when the number of intervals exceeded 100 and the width of each interval was selected such that the mean number of events in each time interval (i) was less than 30.	12850
High Efficiency SiC/SiC Composite Heat Exchanger Structures, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Scramjet propulsion systems for future hypersonic aerospace vehicles will be subjected to heating rates far greater than current materials can manage. In order to sustain high thermal loading while preheating the fuel, regeneratively cooled hot flow path components fabricated from ceramic matrix composites are being considered. The limited availability of high-temperature/environmentally durable materials focuses attention to silicon carbide fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (xxxxxx/xxxxxx) composites. These materials exhibit a unique combination of low density, high thermal conductivity and outstanding strength to near 3000oF. In order to exploit the benefits of xxxxxx/xxxxxx composites, methods are needed for fabricating high density/high conductivity components incorporating impermeable metal tube liners. Additionally, practical methods are needed for uniformly distributing coolant to the array of tubes via manifolding on the backside of the hot flow path surface. The objective of this xxxxxx I program is to demonstrate a promising method for producing a high thermal efficiency xxxxxx/xxxxxx composite heat exchanger with low residual porosity and high interlaminar strength without having to resort to exotic and costly 3D fiber preforms. A functional actively cooled composite panel test article incorporating refractory metal tubes will be designed, fabricated and delivered to xxxxxx for burner rig and/or thermal evaluation.	12851

Distributed Formation State Estimation Algorithms Under Resource and Multi-Tasking Constraints, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	Recent work has developed a number of architectures and algorithms for accurately estimating spacecraft and formation states. The estimation accuracy achievable during spacecraft operation depends not only on the algorithm, but also on its implementation. Typically, the algorithm will be implemented on a real-time multi-tasking processor that allocates on-board computational resources to multiple tasks and functions according to some scheduling policy. The processor's task scheduler  may induce delays that were unaccounted for at design-time and may sometimes preempt estimation tasks in favor of other tasks. Hence, estimation accuracy and in general the performance of any embedded algorithm can be significantly lower than expected during execution. The goal of this project is to develop distributed spacecraft state estimation algorithms that account for real-time multi-tasking processor and other implementation related resource constraints. We bring together modeling techniques from multi-class queuing, well-known xxxxxx filtering techniques and recent advances in embedded systems to develop an innovative co-design framework for the design of embedded state estimation algorithms and software. During the proposed effort, we will design, implement and evaluate estimation algorithms on a network of real-time processors or hardware emulations of processors on-board formation spacecraft.	12857
Hybrid-Electric Rotorcraft Tool Development, Propulsion System Trade Space Exploration, and Demonstrator Conceptual Design, Phase II	2017-11-01	2018-07-19	Hybrid-electric propulsion is becoming widely accepted as a potential disruptive technology for aircraft that can provide significant reduction in fuel consumption as well as many other benefits. The majority of the analysis tools that exist today, however, do not harness the capability to analyze these unique systems, especially in the rotorcraft realm. The xxxxxx I effort focused mainly on the development of the PANTHER tool in preparing it for modeling hybrid and all-electric rotorcraft. The tool was then exercised by modeling a handful of propulsion architectures. The goal of the proposed xxxxxx effort is to further improve upon the strengths of the PANTHER code that was developed, and then utilize this tool to further explore the hybrid-electric rotorcraft design space. Given the goals of the Revolutionary xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Project (RVLT), the PANTHER tool must be further expanded to enable the sizing and performance analysis of unique rotorcraft configurations with propulsion system designs unseen in the vertical lift realm. The tool will be expanded with modules for fuel cells and flywheels along with improved engine modules, physics-based motor and drive models, and a new capability to model complete missions. The thermal management aspect will also be addressed with modules for radiators, cooling ducts, fluids, and pumps. With the capability of PANTHER vastly enhanced, numerous trade studies will then be conducted that attempt to explore a large portion of the rotorcraft trade space made possible by hybrid-electric propulsion systems. These trades will aim to answer many of the questions that have arisen in the community about hybrid-electric rotorcraft. Using the results and lessons learned from these studies, and accommodating the goals of xxxxxx and the RVLT project, a detailed conceptual design will be performed on a notional hybrid-electric rotorcraft demonstrator.	12858

Microbial Observatory (ISS-MO): Indoor microbiome study of the International Space Station surfaces	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	Presented here is the environmental microbiome study of xxxxxx surfaces. The environmental samples were collected with the polyester wipes from eight different locations in the xxxxxx during two consecutive sampling sessions (three months apart). The specific objective was to unveil the pool of genes for each location during two separate sessions to learn of functional and metabolic diversity of microorganisms in the ISxxxxxx xxxxxx (xxxxxx) as a closed built environment has its own environmental microbiome which is shaped by microgravity radiation and limited human presence. The microbial diversity associated with xxxxxx environmental surfaces was investigated during this study. xxxxxx wipes and contact slides were used for sampling of eight various surface locations on the xxxxxx at different time periods. The samples were retrieved and analyzed immediately upon the return to the Earth (via Soyuz TMA-14M or xxxxxx capsule from xxxxxxX). After surface sample collection contact slides containing nutrient media for the growth of bacteria and fungi were incubated at 25 xcb x9aC. The polyester wipes were processed to measure microbial burden (R2A Blood Agar and xxxxxx) and recover cultivable bacteria as well as fungi. xxxxxxly viable microbial burden was assessed using Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods after propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment. The 16S-tag and metagenome analyses were used to elucidate viable microbial diversity. The cultivable bacterial population yield from the polyester wipes was very high (5 to 7-logs) when compared with the contact slides (102 to 103 CFU/m2). The PMA-qPCR analysis showed considerable variation of viable bacterial population (105 to 109 16S rDNA gene copies/m2) among locations sampled. Unlike contact slides polyester wipes cover much larger sample surface (~1 m2) and produce much more reliable results of the microbial diversity of the xxxxxx covering both cultivable and non-cultivable species. The cultivable total and viable microbial diversity was determined utilizing state-of-the art molecular techniques. The implementation of the PMA assay before DNA extraction allowed distinguishing viable microorganisms which is crucial for determining their role to the crew health the xxxxxx maintenance and the general knowledge of the closed environmentally controlled built systems.	12863

The proposed modulator feasibility study would also address the packaging aspect of the HTMX, its miniaturization and manufacturing processes and guidelines to facilitate reliable and repeatable device fabrication and its full adaptation to mission deployment. Our proposed solution offers compelling features such as a rugged package that would withstand atmospheric pressure in excess of 95 bar ambient pressure at +500 degrees C. The design and analysis of the HTMX configuration would include frequency scalable output, and commercially available compact package footprints. Since any hot planet lander system requires reliable communication, the frequency tolerance for HTMX will be optimized to enable reliable transmission fidelity for the xxxxxxians in-situ surface exploration. The underlying objective in evaluating the different modulation schemes is to keep the approach simple. keeping it simple will positively impact the reliability and the eventual xxxxxx of the proposed solution.

The GlideSonde: A Lifting Body Guided Dropsonde, Phase I	2011-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxs are one of the primary in-situ measurement tools available to research aircraft and xxxxxx Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  Unlike sensors mounted on aircraft, dropsondes allow a vertical profile of the atmosphere to be taken below the aircraft.  A guided dropsonde which could glide away from the launch aircraft will allow profiles to be taken away from the aircraft flight path, and would offer aircraft the ability to deploy dropsondes into dangerous environments, such as thunderstorms and volcanic plumes, where few aircraft are able to safely venture.xxxxxx, xxxxxx., in cooperation with xxxxxxilla xxxxxx, xxxxxx., proposes to develop a guided dropsonde to meet this need.  This dropsonde will be designed as a lifting body.

Subsurface Prospecting by Planetary Drones, Phase I	2016-06-01	2018-07-19	The proposed program innovates subsurface prospecting by planetary drones to seek a solution to the difficulty of robotic prospecting, sample acquisition, and sample characterization at multiple hazardous locations in a single mission.  xxxxxxovation focuses on a specific, challenging scenario: sub-surface access of multiple lava tubes by drones far enough from Earth for speed-of-light latency to preclude direct human control.  The technology will be broadly applicable to resource prospecting in cold traps, dark craters, cryovolcanoes, asteroids, comets, and other planets.  The technology is also applicable to xxxxxxrelevant problems such as the detection of poisonous and explosive gases and flammable dust in mines; and surveying urban canyons; exploring bunkers and caves.The proposed innovation is the development of Anytime Motion xxxxxxners that can generate feasible guidance routines to accomplish subsurface prospecting by planetary drones. Anytime Motion xxxxxxners are algorithms that can quickly identify an initial feasible plan, then, given more computation time available during plan execution, improve the plan toward an optimal solution. In addition to Anytime Motion xxxxxxners, optimal guidance routines will also be innovated in this work by formulating xxxxxx (Problem G&C) (Pavone, Acikmese, xxxxxx, & Starek, 2013) as a convex optimization problem and employing interior-point methods to solve the resulting problem to global optimality.

Uncovering the Chemical Processes during Atmospheric Entry of a Carbon/Phenolic Ablator: Laboratory Studies by In Situ Mass Spectrometric and Molecular Beam Techniques	2018-01-01	2018-07-19	Several advanced thermal protection system (TPS) materials currently under development, such as conformal and woven systems, leverage the porous ablator technology developed for phenolic impregnated carbon ablator (PICA), a binary-constituent composite resin infiltrated carbon fiber substrate system.  Current ablation models assume thermodynamic equilibrium chemistry to estimate the recession rate and temperature response, and these models are known to be deficient because they over predicted the recession rate, for example, during xxxxxx entry into the xxxxxx atmosphere.  Clearly, non-equilibrium chemistry is important in such environments; therefore, non-equilibrium models must be built on a fundamental understanding of the relevant non-equilibrium chemical kinetics and dynamics, which may be obtained from in situ measurements of chemical processes during pyrolysis of PICA-class materials under controlled, non-equilibrium conditions.  Validating the models with such high quality laboratory data will enable optimized risk and margin recommendations for a whole generation of future xxxxxx and commercial space missions.  The objective of this effort is to transform our understanding of the decomposition chemistry of carbon/phenolic composite ablator materials using advanced techniques that are well established in the field of reaction dynamics but have not previously been applied to understand the decomposition mechanisms of these materials in an atmospheric entry environment.  To achieve the objective, we will measure time-dependent yields of volatile products during the pyrolysis of a phenolic resin and a carbon/phenolic composite, and we will study the kinetics and dynamics of the heterogeneous reactions of ablation products and representative boundary gases (from Earth and xxxxxx environments) with char and with preform carbon surfaces. We will also investigate the erosion kinetics of pure phenolic resin and a carbon/phenolic composite at high temperatures in a simulated boundary-gas environment.  The focus materials will be PICA, obtained from xxxxxx Materials, xxxxxx., and the separate preform carbon and phenolic resin components of this composite.  The experiments will utilize a molecular beam apparatus with a highly sensitive, triply differentially-pumped mass spectrometer.  The mass spectrometer will be used to detect pyrolysis products of hot materials and reactive products when controlled material surfaces are bombarded with beams of specific reagent gases.  Pyrolysis products will be detected from surfaces with temperatures from ambient to about 1500 K, while beam-surface reactive products may be detected from surfaces with temperatures up to about 2200 K.  For kinetic studies of erosion, surfaces at various temperatures will be bombarded by beams containing pure O2, N2, or xxxxxx and mixtures containing O, O2, CO, xxxxxx, N, and/or N2 in mole ratios to be specified.  Exposed surfaces will be probed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  The PI intends to work closely with xxxxxx researchers to ensure that the experiments conducted will generate data that will validate ablation models under development.	12893

The objective of this xxxxxx project is to continue the engineering development of heat and flame-resistant crew clothing (FRECLOTM) to satisfy xxxxxx needs.  FRECLO consists of xxxxxxoxxxxxx LLC (ISL) proprietary phosphorus-containing flame-retardant (FR) formulations permanently treated on synthetic, natural or blended fabrics as well as on the readymade garments. xxxxxx I demonstrated the xxxxxx use potential. Upon exposure to flame, FRECLO fabrics formed a carbonaceous char layer preventing further fire or heat-induced damage to the fabric. ISL's FR treatments are devoid of halogens, making the process environmentally-friendly and eliminating toxic byproducts during combustion.

Metrology for Freeform Optics	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx requirements for optical instrumentation are requiring larger fields of view and faster f-numbers to complete their objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, opportunities for CubeSat and SmallSat missions are growing as they are seen as a low-cost alternative to perform science for xxxxxx.&nbsp; These demands for fast, wide-field, and small-sized instrument payloads are challenging for traditional optical design forms due to the severe packaging constraints.&nbsp; xxxxxxical surfaces with &ldquo;freeform&rdquo; shapes, however, enable additional degrees of freedom to help reduce volume and even eliminate surfaces from the more traditional design options.&nbsp; Recent GFSC IRADs have investigated the capability of industry to manufacture these surfaces, but, as a final, capstone to this progress, funding is needed to improve the in-house metrology efforts to verify the components, and to develop new and better methods for assembly and alignment of this sensitive optical systems.&nbsp; This work culminates the series of other GSFC IRAD work in the design and fabrication of freeform optics.&nbsp; Furthermore, this effort is fully in line with improving GSFC&rsquo;s capability for testing of other, more traditional aspheric surfaces to reduce costs and keep GSFC at the state of the art and competitive.The objective of this proposed work is to mature the technology to reduce risk in implementing freeforms into optical systems and to improve metrology for aspheres in general.&nbsp; This effort will focus on &ldquo;metrology&rdquo; of optical surfaces with freeform prescriptions.&nbsp;In this work, we will characterize existing optical components using CMM metrology and interferometry for both traditional and freeform optics.&nbsp; We will explore and characterize sources of systematic and random error in the two metrology methods.&nbsp; We will calibrate alignment fiducials using the CMM and then align a simple optical system with the fiducial-based approach, afterward verifying performance with interferometry.&nbsp; A detailed comparison of methods and thorough characterization of uncertainties from these methods has hitherto not been performed to the nm-level needed for visible and UV missions.This will improve GSFC&rsquo;s capability to perform acceptance testing when vendors supply the Government with freeform optics.&nbsp; This acceptance testing will consist of surface error checks using the CMM and fiducial calibration checks.&nbsp; This will establish GSFC&rsquo;s capability to align freeform optical systems using this fiducial-based approach.&nbsp; This work will identify and document new technologies and pursue collaborations with industry through the xxxxxx Opportunities Office, as appropriate.	12895

Co-Cure-Ply Resins for High Performance, Large-Scale Structures	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	Large-scale composite structures are commonly joined by secondary bonding of molded-and-cured thermoset components. This approach may result in unpredictable joint strengths. In contrast, assemblies made by co-curing, although limited in size by the mold, result in stable structures, and are certifiable for commercial aviation because of structural continuity through the joints. xxxxxxfunctional epoxy resins were prepared that should produce fully-cured subcomponents with uncured joining surfaces, enabling them to be assembled by co-curing in a subsequent out-of-autoclave process. Aromatic diamines were protected by condensation with a ketone or aldehyde to form imines. Properties of the amine-cured epoxy were compared with those of commercially available thermosetting epoxy resins and rheology and thermal analysis were used to demonstrate the efficacy of imine protection. xxxxxximum conditions to reverse the protecting chemistry in the solid state using moisture and acid catalysis were determined. xxxxxxernative chemistries were also investigated. For example, self-immolative polymers and photo initiated catalysis would be expected to minimize liberation of volatile organic content upon deprotection and avoid residual reactive species that could damage the resin. The Challenge: Airframe manufactures install mechanical fasteners in adhesively bonded joints to comply with federal aviation regulations. An average commercial aircraft contains several miles of adhesively bonded joints and therefore thousands of redundant fasteners. An alternate means of assembling large-scale composite structures to meet federal regulations is needed to realize the ultimate potential of composites to reduce cost and increase aircraft performance. Removing redundant fasteners may reduce the part count by 120,000 parts and the weight of the aircraft by 5000 lbs. (2%). xxxxxx-functional materials to improve flight efficiency and safety are core components of xxxxxx&rsquo;s mission and align well with xxxxxx&rsquo;s strategic investment plan.The State-of-the-art vs. the proposed method: Large-scale composites structures are prepared by laying up prepreg in a mold and curing it in an autoclave. For thermosetting polymers (e.g. epoxies) the resin reflows upon heating and then undergoes a curing reaction (cross-linking) to form a solid part. If two components are laid-up together and cured simultaneously, this is known as co-curing (see figure). Co-cured assemblies do not require redundant fasteners because the joints are formed seamlessly as the resin re-flows and eventually cures through the formation of new chemical bonds. The use of the co-cure process is limited by the size of the autoclave or oven being used to mold and cure the part. The proposed work will develop a multifunctional epoxy resin that will enable sub-structures to be fully cured while leaving the joining surfaces uncured for assembly in a subsequent, out-of-autoclave, co-cure process. The proposed multifunctional resin, combined with fiber reinforcement, can be used to manufacture composite structures that match the performance of state-of-the-art, mono-functional materials.The xxxxxx Details: The proposed material will be prepared by protecting the reactive groups in a commercially available epoxy resin. Specifically, the amine functional groups of an epoxy hardener will be protected by condensation with a ketone to form an imine. The imine protecting groups will not react with epoxide groups, preventing the resin from curing. After the sub-structures are cured, the imine protecting groups will be removed by exposure to water vapor. Once de-protected, the amine groups will react with epoxides to form a solid, epoxy plastic.The Work Package: Initial demonstrations will be limited to small scale reactions (1 to 10 grams of material). xxxxxx techniques will be used to verify the success of protecting and de-protecting chemistry. The ability of the resin to prevent curing, undergo de-protection, and cure completely will be assessed by thermomechanical analysis. In a subsequent project, the novel resin would be produced in larger quantities and used to make prepreg, which could be used to prepare composite coupons and assess interlaminar fracture toughness.The Risk: xxxxxxhough protecting group chemistry is well known, a significant risk is presented by attempting to introduce new resin systems to aerospace structures. Usually decades of testing and many practical demonstrations are required before new materials are certified for flight. This risk can be reduced by making the minimum possible modification to resin components that are currently in use.	12898
3D Nano-Epitaxial Lateral Overgrowth (nano-ELOG) of Large Area, Highly Efficient, and Flexible Multijunction Solar Cells for Space Applications, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	By Epitaxial xxxxxxeral Overgrowth (ELOG) and Selective Area Growth (SAG) in nanometer scales, xxxxxxLink Devices will develop the next generation of multijunction solar cells for xxxxxx applications. The proposed innovation is the first attempt to use advanced surface nano-engineering technologies to control the formation, propagation and annihilation mechanism of extended defects including dislocations in multijunction solar cells.  There is significant gap between the theoretically calculated efficiency of multijunction solar cells and the experimental results. That efficiency gap increases with the increase of number of junctions/subcells. Misfit dislocations created due to high lattice mismatch between subcells play a major role in hampering the efficiency and reliability of such devices. A successful implementation of nano-ELOG in solar cells will results in 3J solar cells with significantly reduced dislocation density, resulting in an improved xxxxxx and xxxxxx and conversation efficiencies of the cells. Therefore, MLD can utilize this method to grow devices with increased number of junctions to reach practical efficiencies close to 40% (6J) from the current 30% (in commercially available 3J cells) in xxxxxx and 1sun conditions. It is important to explore, and consequently, take advantage of the latest nano-patterning developments for xxxxxx photovoltaic devices.	12899

An Innovative Solution to NASA's NEO Impact Threat Mitigation Grand Challenge and Flight Validation Mission Architecture Development	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	A Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle (HAIV) mission architecture, which blends a hypervelocity kinetic impactor with a subsurface nuclear explosion for optimal fragmentation and dispersion of hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs), has been developed through a 2011 NIAC xxxxxx I study. Despite the uncertainties inherent to the nuclear disruption approach, disruption can become an effective strategy if most fragments disperse at speeds in excess of the escape velocity of an asteroid so that a very small number of fragments impacts the Earth. Thus, the proposed HAIV system will become essential for reliably mitigating the most probable impact threat: NEOs with warning times shorter than 10 years. It offers a potential breakthrough or great leap in mission capabilities for mitigating the impact threat of NEOs. The proposed xxxxxx study further develops the HAIV-based mission architecture and explores its potential infusion options within xxxxxx and beyond.	12904
DAAS: Data Analytics for Assurance of Safety, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	Assuring safe operations in xxxxxx (NAS) encompasses monitoring a variety of systems simultaneously and in real time. It is helpful to imagine NAS as a system of systems where each system loosely interacts with the other. Under this paradigm, an aircraft is a system, so is an airline and as is an airport. Automating safety assurance for each of these systems would involve monitoring an array of sensors each with a different time cycle and reporting characteristics and processing enormous amounts of data. Given the complexing of NAS, it is unlikely that any one tool could provide a solution. Instead, a number of tools each monitoring a smaller, more manageable part of the NAS, all the while sharing information with each other, seem more promising. In the future these tools would ensure airborne separation assurance, track Air Traffic Control (ATC) guidance conformance and ensure safe ground operations. DAAS is an architecture to support these very needs. It forms the basis of a network of smaller, more focused, safety assurance tools that share information and data through a central Big xxxxxx repository that is mined using advanced machine learning algorithms.	12905

Radiation Tolerant Low Power Precision Time Source, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	The availability of small, low power atomic clocks is now a reality for ground-based and airborne navigation systems.  xxxxxx's Low xxxxxx Precision Time Source (LxxxxxxS) is based on Coherent Population Trapping (CPT) technology.  Several of these units were recently delivered to the Air Force xxxxxxoratory (AFRL) at xxxxxx and have demonstrated the performance and robustness of the matured design.  Since CPT technology has been demonstrated as a viable solution to providing low-power, high-performance atomic clocks, it makes sense to explore the potential for deploying these units for space operations.  xxxxxx, xxxxxx and xxxxxx (SWAP) rank among the highest of the critical parameters in the design and fabrication process of a satellite system.  xxxxxxver, the single most critical parameter is perhaps the radiation tolerance of any electronic system.  By using the LxxxxxxS design as a point of departure, xxxxxx proposes to implement a radiation tolerant design of its CPT-xxxxxx xxxxxx Clock to satisfy the need for Low Cost, High Accuracy xxxxxx Signals for small satellite flight opportunities.This xxxxxx xxxxxx I proposal will focus on the design of a Radiation Tolerant Low xxxxxx Precision Time Source (LxxxxxxS-R) suitable for integration into xxxxxx (SPA).	12911

Fabrication Techniques of Stretchable and Cloth Electroadhesion Samples for Implementation on Devices with Space Application	2021-08-01	2018-07-19	The purpose of this study is to determine materials and fabrication techniques for efficient space-rated electroadhesion (EA) samples. xxxxxx metals, including gallium-indium alloy \cite{tabatabai}, as electrodes embedded in an insulating polymer in various patterns will be studied in a vacuum environment, and optimized for application in spacecraft docking, astronaut space suits, and spacewalk gripper devices. Further, this study will characterize materials and fabrication techniques for EA cloths applied as spacecraft blankets with dual purpose of protecting exposed spacecraft surfaces in a space environment and adhesively attaching to objects through a control system. This study focuses on TABS element xxxxxx.3 in using EA technology as a docking and capture mechanism. As a lightweight, low cost, and low power alternative to traditional mechanical docking mechanisms, EA mechanisms in alignment with TA xxxxxx.3.1 will be integrated as docking and automated rendezvous systems. xxxxxxancing scientific knowledge of EA effects, this technology provides alternative capture devices for future xxxxxx missions, specifically for the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, and current space walks on the xxxxxx. Additionally, EA grippers and grabber claws may be used by astronauts on spacewalks to maneuver or collect rocks for scientific studies on xxxxxx.With application in spacecraft docking, orbital debris mitigation, and space walk devices, the fabrication of stretchable EA samples and EA clothes has broader impact in the benefits to the advancement of space technology. Further, stretchable EA has application in the adhesive grabbing of multiple object sizes, and objects that change size over time, as the EA samples are capable of stretching in size. With paper submissions to share research at conferences and outreach to local schools with interactive presentations on EA technology, the public and scientific community will benefit from progression in EA research. As the scientific frontier of space travel advances to xxxxxx and asteroids, adhesive devices using EA technology allow for acquisition of new scientific measurements, accelerating our understanding of the vast universe. Further, research in EA technology with spacecraft docking application benefits society globally with the advancement of space travel. Similar to many technologies that began as space applications and became integral in society, such as cordless tools and long distance communication (xxxxxx), EA advancements are useful as consumer gripper devices and, with further research, may be applied in every-day life.	12917

Analysis of Virtual Sensors for Predicting Aircraft Fuel Consumption	2012-10-02	2018-07-19	Previous research described the use of machine learning algorithms to predict aircraft fuel consumption. This technique, known as Virtual xxxxxxs, models fuel consumption as a function of aircraft xxxxxx Operations xxxxxx (FOQA) data. FOQA data consist of a large number of measurements that are already recorded by many commercial airlines. The predictive model is used for anomaly detection in the fuel consumption history by noting when measured fuel consumption exceeds an expected value. This exceedance may indicate overconsumption of fuel, the source of which may be identified and corrected by the aircraft operator. This would reduce both fuel emissions and operational costs. This paper gives a brief overview of the modeling approach and describes efforts to validate and analyze the initial results of this project. We examine the typical error in modeling, and compare modeling accuracy against both complex and  simplistic regression approaches. We also estimate a ranking of the importance of each FOQA variable used as input, and demonstrate that FOQA variables can reliably be used to identify different modes of fuel consumption, which may be useful in future work. xxxxxx indicates that fuel consumption is accurately predicted while remaining theoretically sensitive to sub-nominal pilot inputs and maintenance-related issues.	12919

Reversible Copolymer Materials for FDM 3-D Printing of Non-Standard Plastics, Phase II	2018-04-01	2018-07-19	Cornerstone xxxxxxearch Group xxxxxx. (CRG) proposes to continue efforts from the 2015 xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx I topic H14.03 ?Reversible Copolymer Materials for FDM 3D Printing of Non-xxxxxx Plastics.? CRGs offers xxxxxx the ability to reprocess space mission waste packaging plastics as an xxxxxx resource for in space manufacturing via xxxxxx Deposition xxxxxx (FDM) type 3-D printing of replacement tools, parts, and devices.  This innovation is enabling for space exploration, the application of xxxxxx reversible thermoset (RVT) polymers combined with a plastic recycling, blending, and extrusion process will allow current and future packaging materials to be processed into a copolymer blend filament suited to FDM 3-D printing system. This approach offers two implementation routes including; (1) An RVT additive that can be combined with existing waste packaging during a reclamation process to produce 3-D printer filament and (2) A RVT based replacement packaging material that can be directly reclaimed into 3-D printer filament.  The material properties of 3-D printer filament from the RVT-based reclamation process can be tuned for mechanical performance (stiffness, flexibility) by adjusting the blend ratios of reclaimed waste packaging:RVT.  This will provide xxxxxx with a means to generate 3-D printer feedstocks with varying mechanical performance from on-hand packaging plastics without the need for separate 3-D printer material payloads.  CRG has already demonstrated the efficacy of RVT additive in reclamation of xxxxxx?s packaging materials in xxxxxx I by producing a co-polymer blend of RVT with xxxxxx packaging, producing a FDM printer filament with the reclaimed packaging, and successfully 3-D printing the resulting reclaimed packaging material.  xxxxxx proposed approach to further develop thermally-reversible polymer materials to reclaim xxxxxx?s packaging will provide a material and processing technology readiness level (xxxxxx) of 5 at the conclusion of the xxxxxx effort.	12921

The telescope consists of an inflatable, half-aluminized spherical reflector deployed within a much larger carrier balloon - either zero pressure or super pressure.	12923

The MRI instrument was only used during first Earth observing period on 18-19 xxxxxxh 2008. The observing period lasted approximately 24 hours, and one MRI image was taken simultaneously with the first north/south scan of the HRI IR spectrometer at half-hour intervals.

Variable Gas-Conductance Radiator: Lightweight, High Turndown Spacecraft Radiator, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx thermal control is a critical element to maintaining spacecraft, manned, unmanned or robotic, at proper temperatures for humans, instruments and electronics to function properly. Simple, passive thermal control in which excess heat is radiated to space via blackbody radiators used to be adequate, however, as spacecraft power levels increase and mission environments become more complex, more flexible and capable thermal control systems and mechanisms are needed. Variable heat rejection is an enabling technology to reliably vary heat rejection during human and robotic spaceflight missions with wide variation in thermal environments & vehicle heat loads. xxxxxx Group is proposing a novel Variable Gas-Conductor Radiator (VGCR) that uses variable gas conduction within an IMLI structure to control heat conduction.   A VGCR could provide both high and very low heat rejection, operating as both effective radiators and high performance insulation, and capable of turndown ratios of 76:1.   The xxxxxx 2012 TA14 Thermal Management xxxxxx stated radiator advancement is perhaps the most critical thermal technology development for future spacecraft and space-based systems. xxxxxx is seeking unique solutions for thermal control technology providing low mass highly reliable thermal control systems.  As xxxxxx moves beyond LEO, spacecraft must accommodate various mission scenarios and need variable heat rejection. Current state of the art variable radiators offer heat rejection turn-down ratios up to about 4:1.  xxxxxx I goals are to develop a new variable spacecraft radiator that can simply and efficiently provide a highly variable heat rejection using variable gas conduction within IMLI insulation, and prove feasibility of the VGCR concept to help improve radiator capabilities for future xxxxxx and commercial spacecraft. A VGCR prototype will be modeled, designed, built and tested for thermal performance and variable heat rejection.	12925
Carbon Nanotube Based Electric Propulsion Thruster with Low Power Consumption, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx project is to develop field emission electric propulsion (FEEP) thruster using carbon nanotubes (CNT) integrated anode.  FEEP thrusters have gained considerable attention for spacecrafts disturbance compensation because of excellent characteristics.  The application of current FEEP has been slow in developing mainly caused by high specific power, which limit the milli-xxxxxx thruster development due to insufficient onboard power.  xxxxxx field improvement from nanometer CNTs is a big advantage to increase the FEEP thrust more than 10 times under constant specific impulse (power).  The CNT based FEEP thruster with low specific power and stable long-term operation will meet spacecraft needs with micronewton to millinewton thrust capability.  The new FEEP device will be constructed innovative in three aspects: (a) xxxxxxtion of CNTs into the ion emission anode, (b) Structural combination from the metal tip emitter and the slit emitter, and (c) Selectable operating thrust units.  In addition, a solid state thruster based on Cs intercalation with CNTs will also be investigated.  The power consumption of the thruster will be reduced by a factor of 5 and more.  The CNT ion emission design may also lead to the development of miniature ion source, benefiting ion source based analytical and material processing facilities.	12926
Reinforcement of 3D Printed Nanocomposite Materials Using Ultrasound Alignment of Carbon Nanotubes	2019-08-01	2018-07-19	The objective of this proposal is to understand how ultrasound waves can be used to create user-defined patterns of nanoparticles in a photopolymer resin, which will then be cured using a stereolithography 3D printing process. 3D printing is an attractive method to manufacture prototypes because highly complex geometries can be created with a single device and limited additional processing. This is especially appealing for space exploration and extraterrestrial colonization, where it is expensive and technically difficult to deliver parts from Earth, but on-site manufacturing capabilities are limited. The critical obstacle that prevents 3D printed polymer parts from being used as actual mechanical components in engineering applications, is their lack of mechanical strength. To increase this strength, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) will be added to the polymer, aligned in patterns tailored to maximize the strength of the part, based on the anticipated mechanical loading of the part. Alignment will be achieved by creating ultrasound standing waves, which exert an acoustic radiation force on the nanoparticles, driving them to desired locations. In contrast to other CNT alignment techniques, ultrasound alignment can be scaled to large areas and it does not restrict the final material shape. In addition, the nanoscale reinforcement could also be used to provide other functionality to the materials, including conductivity, electromagnetic shielding, or other thermal and electric properties. These composite materials attempt to take advantage of the unique properties of nanostructures in macroscale engineering applications. By creating a novel method to create high-strength nanocomposite structures with complex geometries, this research will result in significant advances in the fields of polymer matrix composite and in-space assembly, fabrication and repair research. This project will involve: (1) development of the ultrasound alignment technique within polymer; (2) integration of the ultrasound alignment and stereolithography into a single device, capable of creating 3D printed nanocomposite structures; and (3) analysis of the effects of aligned CNT reinforcement on the mechanical performance of the parts.	12927
Granular Metamaterials and Periodic Structures for Protection from High-Velocity Impacts	2017-09-01	2018-07-19	The unique dynamics of stress waves travelling through chains of spheres has been extensively studied in the elastic-regime and has been shown to create cohesive pulses called solitons that travel through the chains at a rate that depends on the amplitude of the pulse. Because of their demonstrated ability to effectively disperse small shocks, trap energy, reflect and redirect pulses, we are now exploring the applications of solitons in granular crystals to create materials which can effectively survive extremely high-velocity impacts with strain rates on the order of 10^5 -10^7 /sec. The goal of this research is to design and create 3D metamaterials for shock dissipation, leveraging the non-linear dynamics of microstructured materials. This research could lead to multifunctional materials of interest to xxxxxx with improved impact protection as well as radiation resistance and greater thermal control.xxxxxxearch on the dynamics of granular crystals of spheres at very high strain rates and pressures is a new field. Therefore, we don’t know how effects such as plasticity and the strain-rate dependence of the materials, previously considered negligible, will change the properties of stress waves through our materials. We can simulate the physics using finite element methods and lumped mass models of the system and we can perform experiments at various strain-rates using a xxxxxx bar and powder gun. We plan on using this improved understanding of the dynamics of chains of spheres as a starting point on which to grow a catalog of non-linear materials which will allow for the design of metamaterials with tuned and diverse properties for applications in micrometeoroid and orbital debris protection as well as many defense applications.In order to expand the capabilities of our materials, we are also interested in exploring the dynamics of materials that exhibit structural instabilities such as buckling and snap-through. Because materials with instabilities can achieve stiffness and damping properties not typically observed in stable materials, incorporating them into the our granular crystals creates novel ways of controlling energy propagation through structures.	12928

A Compact Extreme Ultraviolet Imager	2014-09-01	2018-07-19	"Just how far can one shrink a solar/heliospheric image??? — Can you shrink it small enough to fit on a cube-sat?   What can we image — successfully — from a cube-sat? And given the technical challenges of maintaining optical sensitivity, thermal control and radiation hardening… perhaps the more vexing question is… Can one design an imager — one adapted and miniaturized specifically for cube–sat implementation — that is applicable to multiple scientific objectives?     We \"answer\" these questions with a resounding — Yes!!!  We believe that the Heliophysics xxxxxx Division/Code 670 is in the unique position to develop a compact, cube–sat-based EUV imager — based upon a commercially–available prototype low-light level camera — capable of either making observations of the xxxxxx and solar corona, or observations of Earth's plasmasphere.  Identical emissions — yet emanating from vastly different plasma environments and, therefore, each carrying its own unique set of information regarding the state of the plasma environment from whence the emissions came.  Despite the apparent physical disparities of these environs, using the same basic EUV imager — but employing a slightly different front-end lens/telescopic system — one could, in principle, be in a position to image either of two vastly different plasma environments as requirements dictated.       With the successful development of such an imager, GSFC would be uniquely well positioned — strategically — to take advantage of the growing number of cube–/µ–/nano–satellite flight opportunities.We propose to evaluate the Intevac Photonics xxxxxxVista® M711 Low xxxxxx xxxxxx Camera as the baseline detector of a new Compact EUV imager (C–EUVI).  To accomplish this task, we will procure a prototype model M711 camera — w/o image intensification — design and implement an appropriate prototype comm-interface, place the unit under vacuum and then test/validate the efficiency/sensitivity of the camera to a range of EUV wavelengths.  The effort will also test/validate the uniformity of — i.e., \"flat-field\" — the detector.   The resulting data set will then used to baseline the viability of implementing this commercially available camera/detector for solar/heliospheric imaging applications. xxxxxxment of a compact, cube–sat-based EUV imager exploits the advantages of using a [prototype,] commercially available, back-illuminated CMOS anode, low-light level camera. Numerous advantages to exploiting this approach exist, including:   Minimal technical risk since the bulk of the camera development is complete; Cube–sat compatible dimensions and power requirements; Use of a CMOS detector is advantageous since it: xxxxxxs the need for active thermal control required by a CCD detector; Provides stable detection in radiation environments; and finally Has a predicted QE > 40% from 2–600Å (soft X-ray to EUV wavelengths).  "	12930
Scalable Lunar Surface Networks and Adaptive Orbit Access, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxovative network architecture, protocols, and algorithms are proposedfor both lunar surface networks and orbit access networks. Firstly, anoverlaying architecture is proposed to seamlessly integrate lunarsurface networks and orbit access networks. xxxxxxondly, for lunar surfacenetworks, a network architecture based on hybrid mesh networkingtechnologies is developed to support both fixed and mobile nodes on thelunar surface. It supports autonomous network coverage extension via adhoc networking capability. Link adaptation algorithms provide automaticlink configuration and ensure constant high link quality in a dynamicharsh environment. To support xxxxxx of heterogeneous traffic types, a xxxxxxoriented MAC protocol with scalable throughput performance is proposed.A hybrid routing protocol is also proposed to enhance routing efficiencyand dramatically improve the reliability of ad hoc networking. Thirdly,for orbit access networks, a dynamic delay and disruption-tolerantnetworking (DTN) routing protocol is designed by integrating DTN andmobile ad hoc network (MANET) reactive routing. It is disruptiontolerant and capable of supporting intermittent links. Finally, beaconbased communications serve as the remedy to handle the emergentsituation where neither lunar surface network nor orbit access is available.	12931
Damage Adaptation Using Integrated Structural, Propulsion, and Aerodynamic Control, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	The proposed xxxxxx xxxxxx I plan of research seeks to develop anddemonstrate an integrated architecture designed to compensate forcombined propulsion, airframe, effector, and structural damage caused bycatastrophic system failure or an intentionally hostile act.  Whereasprior damage-adaptive control work focused on reconfiguring fromunforeseen aerodynamic changes (e.g., effector or airframe damage), theproposed damage-adaptive control approach also accounts for the currenthealth of the propulsion systems and key structural elements.  xxxxxx controller merges available system identification anddiagnostic information to compute a new &quot;safe&quot; operatingenvelope for the vehicle that accounts for identified changes instructural integrity/dynamics.  Once this envelope is computed, thecontroller then proceeds to compute (1) an achievable flight path forlanding the aircraft, and (2) a set of inceptor (or effector) andpropulsion commands that will track the computed achievable referencetrajectory in a decoupled way  all the while assuring that, ifphysically possible, the aircraft will not excite dangerous structuralmodes or create structural loads that would risk further damage.  xxxxxx will also investigate advisory and retrofit implementations ofthe proposed approach that will enable early V&amp;V and implementation.	12932

Comparison of Prognostic Algorithms for Estimating Remaining Useful Life of Batteries	2013-04-10	2018-07-19	We were interested here in particular in conditions where un-modeled effects are present as manifested by the different degradation curve at 45°C. xxxxxxhough all algorithms were given the same amount of information to the degree practical, there were considerable differences in performance. Specifically, the combined xxxxxxian regression-estimation approach implemented as a RVM-PF framework has significant advantages over conventional methods of RUL estimation like ARIMA and EKF. ARIMA, being a purely data-driven method, does not incorporate any physics of the process into the computation, and hence ends up with wide uncertainty margins that make it unsuitable for long-term predictions. Additionally, it may not be possible to eliminate all non-stationarity from a dataset even after repeated differencing, thus adding to prediction inaccuracy. EKF, though robust against non-stationarity, suffers from the inability to accommodate un-modeled effects and can diverge quickly as shown. We did not explore other variations of the xxxxxx Filter that might provide better performance such as the unscented xxxxxx Filter. The xxxxxxian statistical approach, on the other hand, appears to be well suited to handle various sources of uncertainties since it defines probability distributions over both parameters and variables and integrates out the nuisance terms. Also, it does not simply provide a mean estimate of the time-to-failure; rather it generates a probability distribution over time that best encapsulates the uncertainties inherent in the system model and measurements and in the core concept of failure prediction.	12936

Operational High Resolution Chemical Kinetics Simulation, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	"Numerical simulations of chemical kinetics are critical to addressing urgent issues in both the developed and developing world. Ongoing demand for higher resolution models with larger chemical mechanisms drives exponential growth in computational cost: many models spend over 90% of their runtime simulating chemical kinetics.  Energy efficiency and renewable energy system research and development depend on simulations involving thousands of chemical species and reactions, but there are no general analysis tools that can handle mechanisms of this size. Simulations of more than a few hundred species or reactions are hand-tuned, ad-hoc solutions that will ultimately become obsolete.  xxxxxxxxxxxx will address this need by improving its \"Kppa\" general analysis tool for chemical kinetics to facilitate coupling with high resolution models and to support large chemical mechanisms.  xxxxxx I will explore the feasibility of methods for large mechanism support including flux analysis for sub-cell parallelization and mechanism reduction, dynamic mechanism selection based on environmental conditions, and iterative methods for large sparse systems.  xxxxxx I will also improve Kppa as a general analysis source code generator by implementing accelerated analysis methods that use many-core and multi-core devices and/or xxxxxx to reduce mechanism analysis, support for non-Arrhenius reaction rates, and an interface for coupling Kppa-generated code with high resolution models. xxxxxx will implement large mechanism support based on xxxxxx I findings.  Pre-coupled open source model packages containing Kppa-generated source coupled with a multi-physics or flow code will be provided in xxxxxx I to facilitate commercialization through xxxxxx and beyond.  The improved Kppa tool will reduce time-to-solution by combining the latest numerical and algorithmic developments with accelerated computing technology to enable supercomputer-level performance on smaller computers with lower costs."	12939

Asymmetric Supercapacitor for Long Duration Power Storage, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	"When solar energy is used in aerospace applications, the necessary shadowed parts of the spatial orbit require energy storage for the craft/equipment to continue in operation. xxxxxx are used for the purpose currently, but with increasing power requirements, more efficient charge storage devices have to be developed. Energy storage technologies are expected to have improved energy density, speed, efficiency, or wide-temperature operation (-125oC to over 450oC) with a high cycling stability.

Veritex is a composite material consisting of common reinforcement fibers, such as e-glass, carbon, xxxxxx, or high-strain capable fabrics, and one of CRG's shape memory polymers (SMP). Veritex materials will return to a memorized shape when raised above a specific activation temperature. This unique feature enables the use of Veritex as a primary lunar structure for its predictability and repeatability, which will offer quick, self-deploying lunar habitat that can return to a rigid enclosure after the deployment process. The development of expanding composite habitats will offer increased packing efficiency compared with fully rigid structures that lack expandable characteristics and waste valuable cargo space.

BioSentinel	2019-09-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxxanced Exploration xxxxxxs&#39; (AES) xxxxxxxxxxxx project will develop, prototype, integrate, test, and prepare for the first spaceflight mission of a broadly applicable small satellite-based instrument platform to autonomously perform a range of human-exploration-relevant life-science studies of biological consequences of the space environment beyond xxxxxx (LEO).&nbsp; The small, autonomous, low-power payload (a 6 unit CubeSat) will support biological/radiation testing on uncrewed missions such as xxxxxx Launch xxxxxx (SLS) Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1).Radiation damage studies will be conducted using the yeast xxxxxx cerevisiae and&nbsp;will report double stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) in response to ambient space radiation. &nbsp;The results will be critical for improving interpretation of the biological effects of space radiation exposure, and to reduce risk associated with long-duration human exploration.&nbsp;The &ldquo;6U&rdquo; &nbsp;(10 x 22 x 34 cm; 14 kg) xxxxxxxxxxxx nanosatellite as a secondary payload to fly aboard xxxxxx&rsquo;s xxxxxx Launch xxxxxx (SLS) Exploration Mission (EM) 1, scheduled for launch in xxxxxxe 2019. For the first time in over forty years, direct experimental data from biological studies beyond LEO&nbsp;will be obtained during xxxxxxxxxxxx&rsquo;s 6- to 12-month mission. xxxxxxxxxxxx will measure the damage and repair of DNA in a biological organism and allow us to compare that to information from onboard physical radiation sensors. In order to understand the relative contributions of the space environment&rsquo;s two dominant biological perturbations, reduced gravity and ionizing radiation, results from deep space will be directly compared to data obtained in LEO (on xxxxxx) and on Earth. These data points will be available for validation of existing biological radiation damage and repair models, and for extrapolation to humans, to assist in mitigating risks during future long-term exploration missions beyond LEO.The xxxxxxxxxxxx experiment will utilize the monocellular eukaryotic organism xxxxxx cerevisiae (yeast) to report DNA double-strand-break (DSB) events that result from ambient space radiation. DSB repair exhibits striking conservation of repair proteins from yeast to humans. Yeast was selected because of 1) its similarity to cells in higher organisms, 2) the well-established history of strains engineered to measure DSB repair, 3) its spaceflight heritage, and 4) the wealth of available ground and flight reference data. The S. cerevisiae flight strain will include engineered genetic defects to prevent growth and division until a radiation-induced DSB activates the yeast&rsquo;s DNA repair mechanisms. The triggered culture growth and metabolic activity directly indicate a DSB and its successful repair. The yeast will be carried in the dry state within the 1-atm P/L container in multiple independent culture microwells, built into 96-well microfluidic plates with integral microchannels and filters to supply nutrients and reagents, confine the yeast to the wells, and enable optical measurement. The measurement subsystem will monitor each subgroup of culture wells continuously for several weeks, optically tracking DSB-triggered cell growth and metabolism. xxxxxxxxxxxx will also include a physical radiation sensors based on the TimePix sensor, as implemented by JSC&rsquo;s xxxxxx group, which record individual radiation events including estimates of their linear-energy-transfer (LET) values.

Accelerated Aging in Electrolytic Capacitors for Prognostics	2013-06-19	2018-07-19	The focus of this work is the analysis of different degradation phenomena based on thermal overstress and electrical overstress accelerated aging systems and the use of accelerated aging techniques for prognostics algorithm development. xxxxxxults on thermal overstress and electrical overstress experiments are presented. In addition, preliminary results toward the development of physics-based degradation models are presented focusing on the electrolyte evaporation failure mechanism. An empirical degradation model based on percentage capacitance loss under electrical overstress is presented and used in: (i) a xxxxxxian-based implementation of model-based prognostics using a discrete xxxxxx filter for health state estimation, and (ii) a dynamic system representation of the degradation model for forecasting and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. A leave-one-out validation methodology is used to assess the validity of the methodology under the small sample size constrain.The results observed on the RUL estimation are consistent through the validation tests comparing relative accuracy and prediction error. It has been observed that the inaccuracy of the model to represent the change in degradation behavior observed at the end of the test data is consistent throughout the validation tests, indicating the need of a more detailed degradation model or the use of an algorithm that could estimate model parameters on-line. xxxxxx on the observed degradation process under different stress intensity with rest periods, the need for more sophisticated degradation models is further supported. The current degradation model does not represent the capacitance recovery over rest periods following an accelerated aging stress period.	12962

Mesh Independent Probabilistic Residual Life Prediction of Metallic Airframe Structures, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxxing and Materials, xxxxxx. (GEM) along with its team members, Clarkson xxxxxxersity and LM Aero, propose to develop a mesh independent probabilistic residual life prediction tool for metallic airframe structures. The deterministic solver of this probabilistic analysis tool will be developed by integrating our cutting edge extended finite element toolkit for xxxxxx (XFA) with a novel small time-scale fatigue crack growth model for mesh independent fatigue crack growth prediction of a complex airframe structural component subjected to multiaxial and variable amplitude loading. The fast matching and narrow band technique will be implemented to track a curvilinear 3D crack growth without remeshing. Both the versatility and the high computational efficiency will make the XFA an ideal solution model for the probabilistic life prediction where the initial defect shape and location can be treated as random variables without user intervention. After the integration of XFA with a general purpose probabilistic analysis framework (PFA), the resulting probabilistic version of the XFA (PXFA) will enable the following: 1) fatigue reliability assessment of an aging component; 2) evaluation of design variables to meet a targeted reliability level; and 3) provision of operational decision support using SHM data on repair, maintenance, and life extension options.	12965

While many xxxxxx sensors have been utilized for crop mapping (i.e., ERS-1, xxxxxxxxxxxx Axxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxxx-X, xxxxxxat, xxxxxx-1), no options for cost efficient, systematic, and continental scale data have existed until now. In this new xxxxxx xxxxxx we are expanding upon current research to integrate xxxxxx products and workflows into global food security Decision Support xxxxxx and expand ecosystem services markets.

AIRSAFE: Analytics to Improve Reliability & SAfety in Flight Environments, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	The increased system complexity resulting from interaction of human and automated systems in aviation programs introduces new challenges that need to be addressed. Many notable flight incidents can be wholly or partially attributed to crew error, either due to inexperience with the aircrafts automated control systems or in response to component failures or adverse conditions. xxxxxx safety experts can piece together information and data from multiple sources to identify the cause after an accident or incident has occurred whether it is due to human errors, machine failures or a combination of both. It is therefore reasonable to expect that much of the information is already dispersed in various databases and, with the right tools, flight safety experts can identify deficiencies and factors that may provide indicators or serve as precursors of accidents. Such actionable knowledge will lead to better training, design and/or onboard systems to ensure safety. In response to this need, SSCI proposes to build Analytics to Improve Reliability & SAfety in xxxxxx Environments  (AIRSAFE), a software toolbox that assists flight safety analysts in discovering key factors and their interactions among a large number of potentially relevant factors, testing one's hypothesis on the key factors to safety, and identifying previous incidents that support the hypothesis. The software toolbox is built on our previous and on-going efforts, such as DAxxxxxx's XDATA program, in Bigxxxxxx machine learning.	12967
High Temperature Smart Structures for Engine Noise Reduction and Performance Enhancement, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	Noise mitigation for subsonic transports is a continuing high priority, and recent work has identified successful exhaust mixing enhancement devices that have demonstrated substantial capability for reducing aircraft engine noise in critical takeoff and landing conditions. Existing fixed-geometry versions of such devices, however, are inherently limited to optimal noise mitigation in a single operating condition and also can impose significant performance penalties in cruise flight.  An adaptive geometry device using smart structures technology offers the possibility of maximizing engine performance while retaining and possibly enhancing the favorable noise characteristics of current designs.  The proposed xxxxxx I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, focusing on design and demonstration of variable geometry chevrons using rapidly maturing xxxxxx (SMA) actuation technology.  This work represents an extension of prior successful development of solid state smart structures, though it will exploit new high temperature SMA (HTSMA) materials technology to enable the devices to operate in both low temperature (fan) and high temperature (core) exhaust flows.  While important in its own right, this development also holds the promise of being the first step in development of a range of smart materials devices for a spectrum of aeropropulsion applications.	12968

Enhancing Access to Scientific Models through Standard Web Services, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	We propose to investigate the feasibility and value of the&quot;Software as a Service&quot; paradigm in facilitating access toxxxxxx numerical models. We envision providing prototypeWeb-based access to xxxxxx scientific models (GEOS-5, WRF) and theirresults, via industry-standard service interfaces (OGC's Web CoverageService, Web Map Service, xxxxxx) implemented by open-source softwaretools such as MapServer and THREDDxxxxxxse services would allowdeclarative access to pre-computed model outputs, on-demand(asynchronous or synchronous) model runs, and user-customizable modelworkflows. These services would use the MAP Mobile Environment Workflowtool and associated templates to encapsulate details of the modelsoftware and the computing environment in which it runs. Providing thesemodeling capabilities as a service, through well-defined,widely-supported Web interfaces, would facilitate loosely-coupledcollaborative work among different computing facilities and differentdisciplines; and it would broaden access to modeling beyond thosealready &quot;in the know&quot; or qualified to login to a xxxxxxcomputing resource.

Figuring and Polishing Precision Optical Surfaces, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	"The requirements for cost effective manufacturing and metrology of large optical surfaces is instrumental for the success of future xxxxxx programs such as xxxxxx, WFIRST and NGXO. Our plan in this xxxxxx I effort would be to combine our xxxxxxForm Finishing (UFF) (a sub-aperture compliant wheel and belt type polishing process for rapid material removal from the ground state to a finished optic), with our newly developed xxxxxxSmooth Finishing (USF). USF is our sub- and mid- aperture conformal pad polishing process capable of larger area finishing and smoothing of mid-spatial frequency errors. The UFF rapidly removes residual grinding marks and sub-surface damage, while providing a robust solution for surface corrections on the required X-ray mandrels and cylindrical shells. Our USF process was initially developed for high speed finishing of hard ceramic plano components and is now producing impressive test results for smoothing of critical aspheric components. xxxxxxiPro's technologically advanced optical manufacturing capabilities, along with our strong university and industry partnerships, gives us a very strong team and a clear path towards developing and commercializing the platforms which solve the difficult challenges associated with the fabrication of these large complex mirrors and cylindrical shells.The proposed xxxxxx I plan will include fabrication, test and delivery of a 0.25 meter precision mirror. The part geometry will be measured with xxxxxxiPro's \"xxxxxxSurf\" a non-contact free-form measurement system. We envision that the work done during xxxxxx I will be extended during xxxxxx to hyperbolic or elliptical shaped mirror surfaces with dimensions ranging from 1 to 2 meters. This research will position us with the information needed to develop the machine platforms needed for the fabrication and test of these large xxxxxx mirrors, which could also be a xxxxxx deliverable."	12973

Integration of Performance Based Operations into ATM and TFM Simulations, Phase II	2012-02-01	2018-07-19	FAA predicts that air traffic will double or even triple by 2025 and unless solutions that enable improvements in the use of airspace can be developed and implemented, significant airspace congestion will occur.  xxxxxxancements in aircraft capabilities via new technologies can enable aircraft to operate more efficiently in the NAS and to operate safely in areas previously restricted.  AeroTech proposes to enhance the assessment of Performance xxxxxx Operations (PBO) by implementing the Autonomous Weather xxxxxx (AWHAM) into xxxxxx simulations providing autonomous guidance for aircraft thru hazardous weather regions.  PBO and traffic flow schemes can be assessed for any scenario by varying the detection capabilities of simulation aircraft, regulations, and/or policies, and examining deviation decisions, flight paths, safety impacts, and NAS throughput.  xxxxxx will involve implementing the hazard avoidance model into an operational simulation and performing a proof of concept study that will establish and quantify the benefits of aircraft equipped with particular hazard detection capabilities from the perspective of an aircraft operator.

ChemCam-like Spectrometer for Non-Contact Measurements of Key Isotopes, Phase II	2016-04-01	2018-07-19	"This project addresses the need for a non-contact instrument capable of measuring the isotopic ratios O-18/O-16 and D/H from water ice and other solid materials (rocks). xxxxxx is the dominant ice in the outer solar system, recently found on the xxxxxx. Extensive deposits of near-surface ice discovered on xxxxxx. xxxxxx and hydrogen isotopic records preserve history of water/rock interactions depending on chemistry and ambient conditions. Ratios of these isotopes are the main tool in paleoclimatology studies on Earth. A proposed non-contact optical instrument similar to ChemCam will be capable of measuring not only complete elemental compositions but also the key isotopic abundances in surface materials. We demonstrated the resolution and sensitivity required to determine these isotopes in synthetic samples and natural minerals relevant to xxxxxx. We are utilizing and developing our recently published technology: xxxxxx Ablation Molecular Isotopic xxxxxxmetry (LAMIS). Our concept is simple and scientifically proven. We will advance to xxxxxx4 with the further aim of integrating our LAMIS detector with a ChemCam-like instrument. The proposed effort leverages and advances the technology developed for ChemCam. The added strength of measuring isotopes will greatly expand the capabilities of the ChemCam, which is already a highly successful instrument onboard \"Curiosity\". We will develop a breadboard prototype of the instrument that can be later amended to measure other key isotopes (C, N, B, Cl, Mg, Ca, Sr). We plan further infusion in xxxxxx missions and commercialization. The immediate focus is on xxxxxx but our concept is also highly germane to future landing missions to the xxxxxx, other planets and their moons, asteroids, and to a broad range of applications in ecology, agronomy, nuclear industry, radio-chemotherapy, forensics, security and other fields. Our instrument can be used for stand-alone landing missions or for in situ sample characterization prior to sample return."	12980

Micro-cathode Arc Thruster PhoneSat Experiment	2013-10-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx-cathode Arc xxxxxx xxxxxxsat Experiment&nbsp; was a joint project between xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxersity and xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx that successfully developed and integrated a fully operating electric plasma propulsion subsystem for xxxxxx commanded by the xxxxxx developed xxxxxxSat bus. The integrated system was tested and evaluated successfully. A prototype version was integrated by the MAPERS team this summer, demonstrating the integration and control in the desired cubesat form factor. The integrated demonstration systesm consists of a Pulsed xxxxxx xxxxxx operated by a phone and a commercial micro-controller that generates a plasma jet that comes out of the thruster head. The PPU has two main parts: an Inductor for Energy xxxxxx (IES) and an Anode/Cathode Discharge (ACD) section. The latter is where the thruster head is located schematically. An anode made by nickel, a cathode made by titanium and a ceramic insulator form the thruster head. The anode and the cathode are connected to the PPU by copper wires and a metallic spring. The cathode itself is the actual solid propellant of the thruster.These parts are mutually exclusive, meaning that the current only flows in one of them at the same time. xxxxxx (IGBT) controls the current flow in both of the sections. The input of the entire system is received in form of a trigger pulse from the micro-controller. This pulse has a moderate amplitude of about 3 V with a specific period and waveform. The operation of the thruster can be split into two main steps, a charge and a discharge cycle. During the charge period, the power capacitor stores energy up to its maximum and the float voltage is used to charge the inductor. Current only flows in the IES section. At this time, the trigger pulse pass through the gate of the IGBT, causing a current flow from the collector to the emitter of the transistor, closing the circuit. At the end of this step, the inductor is charged to its maximum. In the discharge cycle, once the IES is completely charged, the trigger pulse is turned low. When there is no input at the gate, the IGBT is switched off. Therefore, any current flows from the collector to the emitter and a rapid discharge goes through the ACD section between the anode and the cathode. A peak voltage of several hundred volts is generated between both electrodes. Arc currents in the order of several tens of Ampere flow from the anode to the cathode. A plasma-jet is produced. Then, plasma flows through the carbon paint connection to the cathode, where the propellant material gets consumed.Regarding the interface, the shipment of commands from the xxxxxx was established through a serial port. Tests are done by sending commands that activate the trigger pulse and enable the various thruster channels. All three thruster were successfully commanded and operated. Frequencies of 1, 2, 10, 25 and 50 Hz were tested, demonstrating activation at each frequency. The Smartxxxxxx interface was programmed in xxxxxx while the micro-controller interface was programmed in xxxxxx.This system has reached a xxxxxx of 6 by being tested in relevant conditions of vacuum this summer at the xxxxxxing Evaluation xxxxxx at xxxxxx xxxxxx. Three different thrusters were fired at the same time.	12982
Design Concepts for Cooled Ceramic Matrix Composite Turbine Vanes, Phase II	2013-05-01	2018-07-19	The work proposed herein is to demonstrate that the higher temperature capabilities of Ceramic xxxxxx (CMC) can be fully utilized to reduce emissions and improve fuel consumption in gas turbine engines.  The work involves closely coupling aerothermal and structural analyses for the first stage vane of a high pressure turbine (HPT).  These vanes are actively cooled, typically using film cooling.  Ceramic materials have different structural and thermal properties than conventional metals used for the first stage HPT vane.  xxxxxxe configurations which satisfy CMC structural strength and life constraints, while maintaining vane aerodynamic efficiency and increasing mainstream gas temperature for improved engine performance will be identified.

Extreme Temperature Gearhead, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	In response to the need for actuators, particularly, gear heads, that can operate in the harsh xxxxxxian environment for extended periods of time, on the order of several days to weeks, xxxxxx proposes to develop and demonstrate an extreme temperature compatible gear head. The proposed effort will consider the novel design of gear bearings, which is capable of handling wide range speeds and loads requirements, but will also incorporate standard bearings as a means of constraining relative axial motions of the gears.

The introduction of these nanoscale features will enable realization of an intermediate band solar cell (IBSC), while simultaneously increasing the effective absorption volume that can otherwise limit short circuit current generated by thin quantized layers. The triple junction cell follows conventional designs comprised of bottom Ge cell (0.67eV), a current-limiting middle xxxxxx (1.43eV) cell, and a top Inxxxxxx (1.90eV) cell. The xxxxxx cell will be modified to contain InAs nanowires to enable an IBSC, which is predicted to demonstrate ~45% efficiency under 1-sun xxxxxx conditions. The InAs nanowires will be implemented in-situ within the epitaxy environment which is a significant innovation relative to conventional semiconductor nanowire generation using ex-situ gold nanoparticles. Successful completion of the proposed work will result in ultra-high efficiency, radiation-tolerant space solar cells that are compatible with existing manufacturing processes. Significant cost savings are expected with higher efficiency cells which enables increased payload capability and longer mission durations.	12993

Experimental and Numerical Investigation of Ablation Kinetics	2018-01-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx (UVM) and the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx (UMI) propose a 2-year experimental and numerical research effort aimed at providing critically needed information on the state of pyrolysis gases leaving a porous char material for a carbon/phenolic ablator and reacting with hot boundary layer species.  This proposed activity directly addresses 1) finite-rate gas-surface interactions; 2) finite-rate chemistry of pyrolysis and boundary layer gas interaction; and 3) resin decomposition.  The experimental approach for these elements is the use of species-selective, laser-spectroscopic measurement techniques to quantify the chemical composition and thermal state of the gases as they leave the char surface and interact with the plasma boundary layer.  The justification for addressing these elements is the lack of such experimental data to guide model development. The proposed experiments involve exposing selected carbon/phenolic material samples to high-temperature plasmas with varying composition (argon, nitrogen, oxygen, and air) in the UVM 30 kW Inductively Coupled xxxxxx (ICP) Torch Facility.  During the tests the interaction zone will be probed using tailored, time-resolved Diode-xxxxxx Absorption xxxxxxscopy (DLAS) and emission spectroscopic instrumentation.  These experiments will establish which species leave the material, and how the composition varies with the introduction of different reacting plasma species (Ar, N, O). A parallel experimental effort will be devoted to developing novel sample test configurations that provide a constant char surface location in the plasma stream by allowing sample movement within the holder. The objective of this work is to establish quasi-steady test conditions to enable spatially resolved xxxxxx-Induced xxxxxx (LIF) measurements of key species. Computations performed by UMI will support the development of this capability by simulating the experimental configuration and test conditions using state-of-the-art numerical codes that include pyrolysis and plasma species interaction chemistry.  UMI has direct prior experience of simulating the flow in the UVM ICP Torch Facility.  These simulations will help define test configurations and conditions as well as provide continuous feedback on experimental findings.The proposed investigation addresses three of the physical processes of Topic 1 with a set of carefully designed experiments that take advantage of existing laser spectroscopic instrumentation to quantify concentrations and gradients of key reacting species: O, N, H, C, CN, CH, OH.  xxxxxx on prior work some of these measurements determine surface reaction rates, but in all cases the data will provide a valuable resource for validating the chemistry of advanced ablation models. These validation data sets will be comprised of in situ measurements of key species within the non-equilibrium reaction zone, along with carefully measured plasma test conditions and uncertainty estimates for all measured values.  This will facilitate the development of better ablation models, which, in turn, enable more reliable and better-understood heat shields, leading to increased payload and/or mission flexibility.	12997

Principle of combined acoustic emission/thermal monitoring of TPS The general aim of this work is to develop and demonstrate a prototype structural health monitoring system for thermal protection systems (TPS) that incorporates piezoelectric acoustic emission (AE) sensors to detect the occurrence and location of damaging impacts, and an optical fiber xxxxxx grating (FBG) sensor network to evaluate the effect of detected damage on the thermal conductivity of the TPS material. Following detection of an impact, the TPS would be exposed to a heat source, possibly the sun, and the temperature distribution on the inner surface in the vicinity of the impact measured by the FBG network. A similar procedure could also be carried out as a screening test immediately prior to re-entry. The implications of any detected anomalies in the measured temperature distribution will be evaluated for their significance in relation to the performance of the TPS during re-entry. Structure of optical fiber network An important aspect of this proposal is the development of a robust, electronically-reconfigurable FBG network that employs the optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) technique to measure temperature-induced strains in the xxxxxx gratings. The network will have a high degree of redundancy to ensure its continued effectiveness in the event of damage to one or more fiber segments. xxxxxx will be routed around damaged fiber segments, so that the network can continue to operate even when some regions of it are damaged. xxxxxx routing/configuration could be: i)        controlled from a central processor, using wired or wireless communications; or ii)      determined using a distributed, self-organized approach to control of the sensor network. This approach has been outlined in a recent Contractor xxxxxx (xxxxxx & Price, xxxxxx/CR-2007-215092). Both these approaches will be demonstrated, the former as a bench-top demonstration to establish the feasibility of the principle of OFDR in a switched FBG network (by end FY11), and the latter as a fundamental component of the TPS health monitoring application demonstrator. Proposed demonstrator architecture and structure The project will build a demonstration structure that loosely simulates a segmented, circular ablative thermal protection system (a developmental prototype segmented ablative TPS has recently been developed for the xxxxxxn CEV program by Boeing). The structure will consist of three layers: a metallic carrier, a bond layer and the TPS layer, which will be fabricated from a material whose acoustic and thermal properties should be similar to those of a relevant heat shield material. A comprehensive program of measurement of the acoustic and thermal properties of the materials used in the demonstrator structure will be carried out in order to underpin the development of computational models of acoustic and thermal propagation within the structure. Acoustic and thermal modeling will be used to determine sensor densities and placements: piezoelectric AE sensors will be bonded to one surface of the carrier and the FBG network described above will be embedded in the bond layer, adjacent to the TPS material. A second FBG sensing network, with sensors separately configured to measure temperature and strain, will be mounted on the inside surface of the carrier structure to measure effects of high temperature and mechanical strain on the structure (objective c). Schematics of the demonstration structure will be provided in the presentation. The final outcome of the project will be incorporation of the monitoring system into a larger-scale TPS experimental structure at xxxxxx (in FY15). xxxxxxnic system architecture The proposed electronic control, data acquisition and processing system is based on the architecture of a distributed multi-agent system. Such a system has already been developed and demonstrated for detection and diagnosis of impact damage, as part of a collaboration between xxxxxx and CSIRO. (xxxxxx Contractor xxxxxxxxxxxx/CR-2010-216186). Individual autonomous sensing agents each control a local group of AE sensors and routing switches for the FBG network. Each agent can communicate with its nearest neighbors. Local algorithms that control the communication of information around the network of agents will allow the system to collectively determine the most appropriate path for light propagation through the FBG network, and will enable thermal information obtained by the sensors to be returned to the appropriate local agents. The benefits of a system such as this over a conventional centrally-controlled network include robustness (there is no single point of failure, and the network can continue to function in the presence of damage in some areas), scalability (the number of agents and sensors can be greatly increased without degrading system performance) and ability to respond effectively to dynamic environments.   xxxxxxers xxxxxx, HEOMD, STMD   Products xxxxxxnically-reconfigurable optical fiber sensor network.

High Measurement Channel Density Sensor Array Impedance Analyzer for Planetary Exploration, Phase II	2009-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx exploration missions, such as those planned by xxxxxx and other space agencies over the next few decades, require advanced chemical and biological marker measurement technologies that will help answer fundamental questions about the composition of the xxxxxxar xxxxxx and the possibility of past and present extraterrestrial life. Electrical/electrochemical array-based systems are highly suited for space and terrestrial applications because of their robustness, high-sensitivity, low-power requirement, miniaturization capability, and diverse transducer mechanisms which permit detection of a broad range of target analytes. Scribner Associates xxxxxx. will leverage its expertise in measurement science, analytical instrumentation for arrays, and impedance spectroscopy to develop a prototype high measurement channel density array impedance analyzer for use with existing (e.g., xxxxxx Oxidant xxxxxxent) and future chemical and biological sensor arrays for planetary exploration.

Design and Analysis Tools for Deployable Solar Array Systems, Phase II	2016-10-01	2018-07-19	Large, lightweight, deployable solar array structures have been identified as a key enabling technology for xxxxxx with analysis and design of these structures being the top challenge in meeting the overall goals of the xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx. The use of analysis to drive design from an early stage is critical to their success, yet conflicting design requirements and demanding space constraints make traditional design/build/test methods challenging and expensive. The proposed xxxxxx program focuses on overcoming this through the development of a user-friendly multi-disciplinary design and analysis software toolkit that can rapidly perform parametric studies and design optimization of solar array concepts. The software package will provide a graphical user interface and analysis procedures to evaluate critical performance metrics, while eliminating the unnecessary pre-processing and computational overhead associated with current approaches. xxxxxx capabilities will include flexible multi-body dynamics, array deployment, modal analysis, and response simulation. xxxxxx creation will be simplified through the use of an extensible, hierarchical blockset solution and a library of blocks specific to deployable solar array analysis. xxxxxx effort will focus on the development of advanced analysis and design capabilities and further validation of the tool through test-correlated modeling of a state-of-the-art solar array system.	13000

Anchoring a lander on an asteroid using foam stabilization, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx has proposed several missions to land a craft on an asteroid and potentially to return samples from it.  While large asteroids in the asteroid belt can exhibit a significant amount of gravity, most near-earth asteroids are small and show a surface gravity of less than 0.1% of earth.  xxxxxxding, and staying on the surface of such a small object is a challenge, especially for manned missions.  Just the movement of an astronaut in and out of the lander during excursions would most likely dislodge the vehicle.  Similarly, drilling for a sample return mission requires the ability to exert force onto the surface without pushing the lander off the surface.  A solid anchoring system is required, but made difficult due to the potentially rubble-like consistency of small asteroids, which makes classic mechanical anchoring difficult.Adherent Technologies, xxxxxx. (ATI) has developed innovative materials for space use for over a decade.  These include inflatable structures, self-sealing membranes, coatings for satellites and solar sails, and vacuum-deployable foams.  The proposed program will combine these technologies to produce an anchoring system that deploys either a sticky screen that can attach to a solid rock formation or a foam injection anchor that can bind a large amount of rubble as an anchoring point.  The system is modular, and a decision which anchoring method to use only needs to be made on location.	13005
Titan Montgolfiere Terrestrial Test Bed, Phase II	2014-04-01	2018-07-19	With the xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Mission, xxxxxx is proposing to send a Montgolfiere balloon to probe the atmosphere of xxxxxx.  To better plan this mission and create a robust optimized balloon design, xxxxxx requires the ability to more accurately evaluate the convective heat transfer characteristics of the balloon operating in xxxxxx atmosphere.  xxxxxx on limitations of previous efforts, xxxxxx has requested proposals for a testbed to support CFD validation.  Leveraging the results of the xxxxxx I effort, Near xxxxxx Corporation (NSC), proposes to develop and operate two full scale xxxxxxs (~9 m diameter) in order to help validate CFD models for xxxxxx balloon.  The xxxxxxs will incorporate new envelope design innovations and state-of-the-art data acquisition methods to enable data intensive tethered and free-flight tests.  Utilizing its unique balloon facility located in a large blimp hangar, NSC will conduct iterative tethered hangar tests of the full scale xxxxxxs (which is not possible in existing cryogenic test chambers). These flights will enable better IR imaging and flow characterization measurements.  The acquired data will provide critical input to incrementally improve and validate the CFD models.  The outdoor drop/inflation test and a free flight test will retire technology risks associated with the future xxxxxx mission in addition to generating the validation data necessary to improve the existing CFD models.  NSC proposes to develop and operate a mature TMTT system during xxxxxx, generate pertinent data that will be used to improve the CFD models, and leverage the effort to create valuable technology with both xxxxxx and non-xxxxxx commercial applications.	13006

Iodine Hall Thruster for Space Exploration, Phase I	2012-08-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx proposes to develop a high power (high thrust) electric propulsion system featuring an iodine fueled xxxxxx xxxxxx (HET). The system to be developed will include a thruster, hollow cathode, and condensable propellant feed system. xxxxxx Co. xxxxxx. proposes to develop a high power (high thrust) electric propulsion system featuring an iodine fueled xxxxxx xxxxxx (HET).  The system to be developed will include a thruster, hollow cathode, and condensable propellant feed system.  The nominal power level of the thruster developed in this program will be 20 to 50 kW.  The thruster can be clustered to support ~200 kW class missions to the moon, xxxxxx, and beyond.  In a future program, the technology can be scaled to xxxxxx kW per thruster to support MW-class missions.  The available specific impulse can be throttled between 1500s to will be as high as 3000 to 4000 s.  The use of iodine propellant enables significant mass and cost savings for lunar and xxxxxx cargo missions, including Earth escape and near-Earth space maneuvers.  High purity iodine is readily available commercially in large quantities at a fraction of the cost of xenon.  Iodine stores at a density that is 3 times greater than xenon and at less than one thousandth of the pressure.  Thus, iodine may be stored in low volume, low mass, low cost propellant tanks instead of the relatively large, high pressure, high cost COPV tanks required for xenon xxxxxx thruster systems.  xxxxxx has already demonstrated a low power (several hundred watts) iodine thruster system based upon its flight qualified BHT-200 thruster.  At most points, the efficiency are the same or nearly the same given experimental uncertainty.  xxxxxxver, iodine may have a significant performance advantage at high power:  Iodine yielded significantly higher specific impulse and thrust to power at higher input power.  This effect will be investigated with the proposed high power system.	13008
Drag &Drop, Mixed-Methodology-based Lab-on-Chip Design Optimization Software, Phase II	2005-12-01	2018-07-19	The overall objective is to develop a ?mixed-methodology?, drag anddrop, component library (fluidic-lego)-based, system design andoptimization tool for complex lab-on-a-chip systems.  Experiments-baseddesign is expensive and time-consuming.  Full multiphysics simulations,while successful in designing components, are computationally infeasiblefor system design.  The proposed tool will accelerate (days to minutes)and simplify (non-expert vs. expert) biomicrofluidic system design.Simple representation of complex, interacting physico-bio-chemicalprocesses is a formidable challenge.  Our innovative ?mixed-methodology?solution seamlessly exchanges information between vastly differentmethodologies, (Artificial Neural xxxxxx, Differential AlgebraicEquation, Analytical and High-fidelity).  In xxxxxx I, we have developeda hierarchical software consisting of xxxxxx (GUI), xxxxxxxxxxxxver and component models.  Proof-of-concept was successfullydemonstrated, (compared to high-fidelity simulations), by characterizinga candidate biomicrosystem in a fast (350 fold reduction, 1.5 hour to 15seconds), intuitive manner, while retaining accuracy (~10&#37; difference).xxxxxx will feature enhanced component models and system solver formultiphysics phenomena (electrokinetics, biochemistry, capillary andhemodynamics), augmented GUI functionalities and extended library ofmicrofluidic components.  An expert advisory board (xxxxxx, academia,industry) will guide the multidisciplinary development team.  CFDRC iscommitted to developing simulation tools for biotechnology, and willleverage its considerable expertise and resources toward successful commercialization.	13009
Lab-on-a-chip astrobiology analyzer, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	The overall goal of this program (through xxxxxx) is to develop an astrobiology analyzer to measure chemical signatures of life in extraterrestrial settings.  The analyzer will employ a lab-on-a-chip to extract biochemical signatures from soil or water samples and surface-enhanced xxxxxx spectroscopy to detect and identify the signatures.  The goal of the xxxxxx I program is to demonstrate feasibility by separating mixtures of amino acids in SER-active sol-gel capillary columns.  This will be accomplished by developing new sol-gels that selectively extract the amino acids from flowing water, while at the same time providing SER activity to identify the amino acids, individually and as a class.  xxxxxx work will design, build and test the proposed prototype lab-on-a-chip analyzer.  This will be accomplished by incorporating the sol-gel coated capillaries into a lab-on-a-chip, and performing chemical separation and xxxxxx signal enhancement sufficiently to identify chemical signatures of life.	13010

A prototype will be delivered at the end of xxxxxx.	13011
Integrating Standard Operating Procedures with Spacecraft Automation, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx automation can be used to greatly reduce the demands on crew member and flight controllers time and attention. Automation can monitor critical resources, perform routine tasks, respond to unexpected events, and manage the overall operation of on-board systems.  xxxxxx members and flight controllers also use standard operating procedures to manage the tasks necessary to operate complex space missions. These procedures document both manual, non-automatable tasks and the interaction with automated space systems. In current xxxxxx operations, however, automation systems and procedures are completely divorced from each other. Thus, procedures cannot start automation processes, monitor automation systems, or respond to state changes in automated systems.  xxxxxx has developed an integrated development environment for electronic procedures called PRIDE. Our subcontractor, The Hammers Company, has developed an automation system called  xxxxxx and its xxxxxx Test and Operations xxxxxxuage (STOL) interpreter.  In xxxxxx I of this research, xxxxxx and The Hammers Company integrated PRIDE with xxxxxx as a proof-of-concept example of the capabilities provided by a link between standard operating procedures and automation systems. xxxxxx of this research will focus on a much tighter interaction between PRIDE and xxxxxx and application to xxxxxx?s xxxxxxource Prospector mission.	13012

Bulk Nano-structured Materials for Turbomachinery Components, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	This xxxxxx xxxxxx I effort seeks to exploit some of the tremendous benefits that could be attained from a revolutionary new approach to grain refinement in bulk metals.  Specifically, preforms of high temperature Ni-base superalloys will be produced in this work with fine grain (FG) to ultra fine grain (UFG) micro-/nano-structures for higher strength.  Despite their excellent corrosion resistance and ability to retain strength under extreme operating conditions, the relatively low strength of xxxxxx and Monel 400 have prevented their more widespread use.  Thus, grain refinement methods that incorporate severe plastic deformation (SPD) offer the opportunity to increase the strength of these alloys.  Most SPD work to date, however, have only been successfully performed on small, laboratory scale samples given the special (expensive) tools and high pressures needed..  Thus, the present work will demonstrate a new, production level grain refinement technology to produce microstructurally enhanced xxxxxx and Monel 400 material with higher strength capability for in-space propulsion applications.	13015

Fiber Optic Pressure Sensor Array, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	VIP xxxxxxs proposes to develop a xxxxxx xxxxxxic Pressure xxxxxx Array for measuring air flow pressure at multiple points on the skin of aircrafts for xxxxxx xxxxxx Test applications. The array consists of multiple micro-miniature optical MEMS pressure sensors interconnected by a common optic fiber to an interrogation system located inside the airplane. The proposed optical pressure sensors are essentially flat, light weight, fully passive (no electrical power), and EMI/RFI immune, they exhibit superior performance regarding accuracy, dynamic range and noise. They are inherently self identifiable; the interrogation system knows what data belongs to what sensor.The proposed sensor array technology is applicable to different types of optical sensors (accelerometers, strain, temperature, etc). Each sensor in the array is designed to work at preset optical wavelengths; they are read by the interrogation system using Wave Division and/or Time Division xxxxxxxing.xxxxxx of aircrafts requires a large numbers of sensors. Each sensor needs four to six wires to interconnect to signal conditioners. For large measuring systems, this means very large numbers of wires that add weight and occupy space.The proposed FO sensor  array system not only has the potential to significantly improve pressure measurements for xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx, but its novel  technology of micro-miniature networking  sensors will benefit many other aircraft ground and flight testing applications.	13017

The treadmill device we propose will offer excellent periodic impact exercise to stimulate bone remodeling and cardiovascular activity as well as an added component of resistive exercise to encourage all-body muscle maintenance. The goal of this project is to demonstrate by design and analysis that the proposed treadmill will satisfy the stringent volumetric, power, and performance requirements demanded by lunar missions and provide the active feedback necessary to control the treadmill and display Daily xxxxxx Stimulus (DLS). We along with our partner the xxxxxx Clinic believe that a hybrid compact exercise device along with the direct feedback of DLS is a unique and new approach that will provide a superior in space exercise system than ones currently in use on xxxxxx. This project will culminate at the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) level having requirements defined and performance verified through analysis and technology demonstration on existing facilities. The technical aspects of the work can be divided into three key areas: xxxxxx Track Treadmill xxxxxx, xxxxxxistive xxxxxxject xxxxxxing Device, and xxxxxx xxxxxx.	13021
Advanced Numerical Tools for Design and Analysis of In-Space, Valve and Feed Systems, Phase II	2009-11-01	2018-07-19	In-space valves are required to provide precise mass flow control, wide throttling range and handle rapid on-off control. These requirements can result in significant unsteady, transient effects both on the fluid mass flow rate, as well as the torque required. xxxxxxver, there currently are no analytical or numerical modeling tools that can predict the unsteady/transient performance of these valves; current design tools are limited to quasi-steady models and empirical correlations.  The innovation proposed here is a high-fidelity, comprehensive numerical tool that can characterize the transient performance of these flight valves and provide design support.  An innovative approach to modeling valve motion in a broad range of valves designs including showerhead, ball and butterfly valves is proposed; this will permit simulations of transient valve operations and the resulting mass flow history and pressure drop.  Unsteady effects at partial valve openings due to both turbulence interactions as well as multi-phase cavitation are addressed with an advanced numerical framework that incorporates both advanced LES models and real-fluid cryogenic effects.  The tools and technology developed here would directly impact design support efforts for the J-2X upper-stage engine in the xxxxxx launcher envisioned under the Constellation program for the mission to the moon.	13022
Ultra Compact Laser for 3D Imaging LIDAR, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	In response to xxxxxx solicitation for light-weight, power-efficient and radiation-hardened instruments that enable robotic exploration of the xxxxxxar xxxxxx, especially xxxxxx, xxxxxx in partnership with xxxxxx proposes to develop a compact and robust xxxxxx instrument to assist in the landing/sampling site selection process. xxxxxx low SWaP and higher energy laser will extend the dynamic range of xxxxxx's xxxxxx instrument to > 10 km.For xxxxxx JPL, xxxxxx completed a design study of potential xxxxxx solutions for a lander. It was concluded that the challenging xxxxxx requirements could be met with a laser of about 1W average power, using short pulses in the green at a PRF of ~30 kHz. The biggest challenge to this application is the limited mass and the high radiation environment.xxxxxx proposes to develop a 1-W laser that has a volume < 8 c.c and a weight < 20 g. The SWaP is at least an order of magnitude lower compared to the commercially available laser source. The modular form factor allows the laser to be easily modified to produce different wavelengths by frequency up conversion.The ultra-compact laser along with the single photon xxxxxx will find direct and immediate application on at least two more xxxxxx missions - xxxxxxtore-L and ARRM. xxxxxxtore-L is an ambitious endeavor to launch a robotic spacecraft in 2020 to refuel a live satellite in low-Earth orbit and demonstrate a suite of satellite-servicing technologies, potentially including a satellite laser rangefinder using the same laser. The Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM) is designed to send astronauts to visit a large near-Earth asteroid, explore it and return with samples in the 2020s. This is part of xxxxxx plan to advance new technologies and spaceflight experience in preparation for a human mission to the xxxxxx system in the 2030s.	13023
Organoselenium Surface Modification of Stainless Steel Surfaces To Prevent Biofouling in Treatment of Space Wastestreams, Phase I	2014-11-01	2018-07-19	The objective of this work is to quantify the reduction of biofilm formation in a water distribution system resulting from an organoselenium surface coating on stainless steel pipes and fittings.  Differentiated from currently marketed antimicrobials, selenium, is permanent, catalytic and does not leach into the environment. This will reduce the problems associated with biofilm growth and fouling in the water recycling system.. Thus, we could draw quantifiable conclusions about the system performance for long term missions in complex water treatment systems containing organoselenium coatings and provide the data to xxxxxx engineers who may then make an assessment as to whether or not this is a viable technology to reduce the need for biocides, reduce ESM, and potentially impact xxxxxx by decreasing the chemical burden for treatment which would decrease payload mass and downtime affecting astronauts' efficiency.The project will quantify the impact of an organoselenium surface coating within stainless steel pipes and fittings on product water quality and service life of the pipes and fittings over time.   xxxxxx.  xxxxxximize the attachment of organoselenium to the surface of stainless steel to achieve the greatest and most reliable reduction in biofilm growth and formation.xxxxxx 2.

Plug and Play Realtime Diagnosis for Ground Processing System Integration, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	"xxxxxx \"xxxxxx xxxxxxs xxxxxxment and Operations Program\" is moving towards transforming parts of xxxxxx from a historically government-only launch complex to a spaceport bustling with activities involving government and commercial vehicles alike. The success of this transformation drive largely depends on achieving the ability to process multiple types of vehicles, within a rather short time and in an economic way. QSI proposes developing a COTS (Commercial off-the-Shelf) Software to facilitate 'xxxxxx and Play Real-time xxxxxx for xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxtion' to support achieving the objective of the program. QSI will add capabilities to their TEAMS (Testability xxxxxxing and xxxxxx xxxxxx) toolset such that it will enable xxxxxx to perform diagnostic analysis for various vehicular and ground systems without the requirement to build the analytic models and software tools from ground-up. Here, xxxxxx is only required to build the diagnostic models (required for system integration, testing, assembly, maintenance/troubleshooting and pre-launch checkout) of the systems. Upon building, those can be used in a plug-and-play fashion through the analytic/diagnostic environment of TEAMS in conjunction with monitored data and test results from the vehicular and ground systems for obtaining diagnostic, prognostic, time to alarm, time to maintenance, etc. decisions."	13025
An Overview of Selected Prognostic Technologies with Reference to an Integrated PHM Architecture	2013-03-20	2018-07-19	This chapter reviewed generic prognosis algorithmic approaches and introduced some of the basics associated with probabilistic predictions and a required architecture for performing prognostics on critical aerospace systems.Prognosis is a critical element of a HM system and has the promise to realize major benefits for cost avoidance and safety improvement for fielded systems. It also presents a number of challenges to the HM system designer, primarily due to the need to properly model damage progression and to deal with large-grain uncertainty. Long-term prediction of a fault’s evolution to the point thatmay result in a failure requires means to represent and manage the inherent uncertainty. Moreover, accurate and precise prognosis demands good models of the fault growth and statistically sufficient samples of failure data to assist in training, validating, and fine tuning prognostic algorithms. Prognosis performance metrics, robust algorithms, and test platforms that may provide needed data have been the target of HM researchers in the recent past. Many accomplishments have been reported but major challenges still remain to be addressed.To address the issue of inherent uncertainties that are the aggregate of many unknowns and can result in considerable prediction variability, the concept of adaptive prognosis was introduced. In that case, available, albeit imperfect, information is used to update elements of the prognostic model. Only one of many approaches for accomplishing this was briefly introduced, namely, the particle filter. Other statistical update techniques include xxxxxxian updating, constrained optimization, and xxxxxx filtering.The design process is not a trivial process by which features and models are chosen for integration such that the best possible prediction on RUL still is obtained. It takes substantial effort to design systems so that measured data can be fused and used in conjunction with physics-based models to estimate current and future damage states. This is exacerbated when multiple models are employed that may use different feature inputs. The prognosis system must also be capable of intelligently calibrating a priori initial conditions (e.g., humidity, strain, and temperature) and random variable characteristics in an automated yet lucid process.	13026

Low-Cost, Low-Power Sensor For In-Flight Unsteady Aerodynamic Force and Moment Estimation, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx and xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx propose to develop a sensor system providing sectional aerodynamic forces and moments with fast response, low volume/size/power requirements for ease of installation, and minimal calibration requirements. Aviation loss of control (LOC) accidents often result from stall and uncertain weather/flow conditions, often at low altitudes e.g., take-off/landing. The sensor system: (1) uses a robust transduction mechanism, (2) has a one-time lifetime calibration requiring minimal maintenance, (3) provides monotonic output with speed and circulation, and is (4) relatively insensitive to environmental parameters such as flight altitude, pressure, temperature, and density. This technology provides real-time output for energy state awareness under both nominal and off-nominal flight conditions.	13028

Automated Autonomy Assessment System, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx has expressed the need to assess crew autonomy relative to performance and evaluate an optimal level of autonomy that maximizes individual and team performance. For this project, we propose to leverage our Automated Behavior and Cohesion Assessment xxxxxx (ABCAT) system, which we designed for xxxxxx for a recent project. The ABCAT system was designed in part to assess crew performance, which we will need for this project as well, and our approach will be to add autonomy modeling and assessment to the design. One of the key results of this xxxxxx I project will be the identification of the most significant aspects of the environment and the behavior of the astronaut's engaged in space flight operations that can be used to identify their actual autonomy and performance level as they perform their tasks. The second will be the design of the data acquisition and processing components and framework that work together to observe and interpret those aspects and provide an assessment of the crew's exhibited level of autonomy and performance characteristics.	13030

10^3 Segment MEMS Deformable-Mirror Process Development, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx AO will extend its proven segmented MEMS deformable mirror architecture to large array sizes required for high-contrast astrophysical imagers.  Current implementations consist of arrays of 37 mirror segments (currently available commercially) and 163 segment arrays (first prototypes under test).  Existing thin-film based MEMS fabrication techniques used by competitors typically can not achieve an adequate degree of optical flatness and maintain it over a range of temperatures.  Even newer thick-film methods suffer from the same problem to some degree.  The xxxxxx AO segmented mirror approach, on the other hand, uses a thick and rigid single-crystal-silicon optical surface bonded to an electrostatically driven actuator platform.  This results in excellent mirror flatness and insensitivity to temperature even when specialized optical coatings are used.  This proposal addresses scaling this technology up to 10^3 segments.  xxxxxx technical issues to be addressed in accommodating the larger number of segments include: (a) controlling overall bow of the larger chip; (b) developing the electrical interconnect design and fabrication process, and (c) modifying the mirror-wafer bonding process.  This xxxxxx I will include one process run in order to test and refine the proposed solutions.	13033
SAW passive wireless sensor-RFID tags with enhanced range, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	This proposal describes the development of passive wireless surface acoustic wave (SAW) RFID sensor-tags with enhanced range for remote monitoring of large groups of conventional sensors.  Passive wireless sensing tags using SAW technology have been demonstrated by xxxxxx at xxxxxx xxxxxxs and others.  These sensor-tags consist of a SAW device with an antenna attached to one port and sensor(s) and reference impedance(s) connected to the other ports.  RF signals are reflected off of the surface wave device, and their reflection characteristics are modified by changes in the impedance of the attached sensor(s).  This proposal describes development of novel passive wireless SAW sensor tags that combine radio frequency identification (RFID) coding with dispersive and low-loss SAW transducers and reflectors.  The proposed devices utilize RFID reflective delay line coding techniques to produce devices capable of data densities over 32 bits, enabling production of large codesets.  xxxxxx in the reflected RFID code are used to identify the device and to provide a measure of the attached sensor(s), along with any internal sensing function(s).   The use of dispersive low-loss transducers and reflectors provides increased processing gain and over 10 times the range of conventional SAW RFID tags.  The proposed sensor devices also operate in a manner that is inherently immune to RF backscatter signals, further enhancing S/N.  Successful completion of the proposed xxxxxx I activities will establish the technical feasibility of these sensor-tags, will evaluate their performance in the laboratory when used with at least two external sensor devices, and will provide performance projections for use with other sensors.  At the end of xxxxxx I, devices will be at xxxxxx 4.  xxxxxx will result in development of multiple uniquely identifiable passive sensor-tags and interrogation systems operable to wirelessly monitor sensors of interest to specific xxxxxx programs (xxxxxx).	13034

At lower temperatures (T Pulse tube coolers at high temperature have offered increased efficiency and reliability over older cooler technology.	13037
Optimizing Battery Life for Electric UAVs using a Bayesian Framework	2013-04-25	2018-07-19	In summary, this paper lays a simple flight plan optimization strategy based on the particle filtering framework described in [5]. This is meant as a first step in formalizing computationally tractable stochastic programming techniques to optimally generate flight plans in response to battery life predictions. This approach takes advantage of the PF framework to simultaneously generate the optimal/sub-optimal flight plan simultaneously with predicting the RUL. Several steps lie ahead like a comparative analysis of alternative stochastic models in terms of optimality as well as computational cost. These options will need to be validated by flight tests where robustness to environmental conditions like air temperature and density as well as wind speed can be evaluated. The notion of risk-tolerance can be introduced via appropriate objective functions, thus allowing a non-zero risk of the dead stick condition in order to use more battery power.	13038

Cathode for Electric Space Propulsion Utilizing Iodine as Propellant, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	We propose a hollow reservoir cathode suitable for use in ion or xxxxxx thrusters which utilizes iodine as a propellant. xxxxxx cathodes have several unique features which will allow them to resist the corrosive effects of iodine. Chief amongst these is that the barium-emission-material-containing reservoir is isolated from the iodine flow. This allows free barium to be produced in an environment free of iodine. Furthermore, barium production rates in reservoir cathodes can be adjusted to very high levels -- high enough to overcome the deleterious effects of iodine at the cathode's emitting surface. xxxxxx cathodes carry a barium supply that is 100 times that of conventional cathodes. Furthermore, the reservoir cathode inserts can be made of materials other than tungsten. This is not possible with impregnated cathodes. These materials can be selected for their resistance to iodine attack. They include osmium, rhodium, and iridium.xxxxxx is pursuing iodine EP because of iodine's advantages over xenon, especially for small satellite propulsion. Most important are its low cost and its high storage density. Also, it requires no high-pressure, large and heavy pressure vessels.	13042
Low Power 2-Bit ADC Array with Serial Output, Phase II	2013-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx interferometers for xxxxxx missions such as xxxxxx employ the xxxxxx instrument, consisting of 600 receivers. Each receiver requires I and Q ADCs (analog-to-digital converters) for signal digitizing at 1GHz before further processing in the cross-correlators. xxxxxx consumption as well as instrument volume and weight are critical in space born instruments. During xxxxxx I, Pacific xxxxxxchip Corp. designed the block diagrams and circuits of a monolithic array consisting of sixteen 2-bit ADCs. A serializer is integrated to reduce the number of outputs from 32 to 1. This reduces the power consumption per ADC and resolves the problem of wiring congestion in the interface with cross-correlators. For further power reduction, a novel metastability programming feature is integrated into the ADC latches. The clock distribution is fundamentally simplified as well. The 2-wire serial I2C (Inter-xxxxxxted Circuit) interface allows all 1200 ADCs of the xxxxxx instrument to be calibrated and optimized. xxxxxx I work provided a complete definition and in silico validation of the monolithic ADC array with serial output. xxxxxx of the project will produce a fieldable product. In order to facilitate the commercialization efforts in xxxxxx, a Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) xxxxxx-on-Isolator (SOI) technology will be used for fabrication.	13043

Conformal Space Suit Antenna Development for Enhanced EVA Communications and Wearable Computer Applications, Phase II	2011-02-01	2018-07-19	As xxxxxx prepares for the Constellation xxxxxx and xxxxxx (EVA) on the moon by 2018, astronauts will be required to spend more time exposed to the hazards of EVA operations.  Providing reliable communications is imperative during current EMU/xxxxxx operations as well as future Constellation xxxxxx. Communications during EVA is required to relay progress regarding the task and to monitor the health and ability of the astronaut to perform in hazardous environments.  Therefore, in order to improve astronaut mobility and space communications, xxxxxxlied EM, xxxxxx. will apply the results of xxxxxx I to develop and demonstrate a prototype multi-frequency design of a conformal, flexible, body-worn antenna that can be integrated into space suit designs to enhance UHF communications during EVA operations.  In addition, the antenna design has multi-frequency capability that enables wireless bio-med telemetry for wearable computer applications during space operations.  xxxxxx new Constellation xxxxxx xxxxxx (CSSS) will provide new space suit designs to improve the astronaut's mobility, efficiency, and safety while wearing the space suit during long periods of EVA operations.  Therefore, the objectives for xxxxxx will consider antenna designs for both near term and far term space mission applications.	13045
Modular Distributed Concentrator for Solar Furnace, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	This research proposes to develop a lightweight approach to achieving the high concentrations of solar energy needed for a solar furnace achieving temperatures of 1000-2000C.  Conventional solar-fired furnaces face significant challenges in fabricating, deploying and pointing the large aperture, high concentration ratio reflectors that power them. The xxxxxx Distributed Concentrator (MDC) is a systems solution comprising an array of identical, modestly sized solar concentrator dishes with a network of optical or thermal transmission links that route the high quality concentrated energy to a centralized receiver.  The approach provides lower mass because of the ability to optimize the scale of the individual reflectors to achieve high concentration ratio without the heavy structure needed to achieve and maintain optical alignment found in large aperture optics.  The minimum deployed height associated with an array of concentrators allows for good packaging efficiency and minimum deployment complexity, and since the dishes are one-piece and identical, tooling and manufacturing costs are significantly reduced.  The proposed program performs system optimization trades and then proceeds to the preliminary design and development of key components such as the optical light guide and thermal heat pipe transmission links that carry the energy to the furnace, as well as the key input and output interfaces.  A proof-of-concept demonstration in xxxxxx I will be used to validate the performance model and guide the detailed design, development and environmental testing of system components in xxxxxx.	13046
Quantifiable and Reliable Structural Health Management Systems, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	Major concerns for implementing a practical built-in structural health monitoring system are prediction accuracy and data reliability. It is proposed to develop robust state-of-the-art structural health management (SHM) technologies to overcome these concerns.  The proposed solution will be capable of detecting and quantifying damage with a high probability of detection (POD), accurately predicting the residual strength and remaining life of the structures with confidence, and providing information which will allow appropriate preventative actions on the monitored structure. To achieve the objectives the proposed technology will first optimize the sensor network configuration for the SHM system to achieve the highest probability of detection.  Next, robust diagnostic techniques will be developed to achieve quantifiable damage location and size estimation that account for the uncertainties induced by the environments or the system itself continuously during flight or at scheduled maintenance intervals. Finally, efficient probabilistic prognostic methods will be integrated with diagnostic outputs to provide real time estimation of residual strength and remaining life of the damaged structure. Both metallic and composite stiffened aircraft panels will be instrumented and tested under simulated flight conditions to validate the proposed technology. The work will be performed collaboratively between xxxxxx and Stanford xxxxxxersity.	13047
The Cognitive Onboard Operator Assistant Architecture, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	We propose a cognitively inspired architecture for deploying an automated intelligent onboard operator assistant. This assistant facilitates the onboard control while finding a compromise between increasing the operator's awareness of the system tasks and decreasing the operator's workload. The core of this assistant is an adaptive algorithm (AA) that determines the appropriate level of automation (LOA) for the current mission phase depending on factors such as the operator's workload and situation awareness, mission phase requirements and state, as well as human-automation interactions and supervisory control issues.The goal of our proposed agent-based architecture is to facilitate the creation and evaluation of AA algorithms. In order to easily define AA strategies, the architecture provides facilities to explicitly represent, reason with, and update the state of the different knowledge structures needed by the AA. We will develop a testbed to evaluate different AAs regarding the operator's situation awareness in a multi-agent dynamic scenario. To promote experimenter control and rapid evaluations, a graphical behavior language will be used to define the behavior of entities in a simulator-based experimental scenario. xxxxxx I will focus on the definition of the testbed and in creating a system prototype. xxxxxx will focus on making the architecture robust and testing it in a high fidelity simulator.	13048

The research focus area Airspace Super-Density Operations (ASDO) pertains to highly efficient operations at the busiest airports and terminal airspace. Deterministic analysis of the proposed xxxxxx concepts may not be sufficient, as inability of aircraft to adhere to flight schedules exactly and operational uncertainties may significantly alter the effectiveness of the proposed concepts.  The primary objective of this research proposal is to create a High-Fidelity xxxxxx of the Terminal Area and a Framework for Performing Time-Varying Stochastic xxxxxx of Terminal Area Operations with regards to xxxxxx and Operational xxxxxx. xxxxxx can be used to evaluate the interaction and combined performance of multiple xxxxxx concepts in the ASDO research focus area. The xxxxxx I effort will develop a sample xxxxxx for a moderately complex terminal area, e.g. xxxxxx. The utility of the developed xxxxxx and xxxxxx will be illustrated using two case-studies in the xxxxxx terminal area. xxxxxx research effort proposes to develop integrated surface/terminal area queuing model of a xxxxxx.

We will use our proprietary patented single-frequencyQ-switched fiber laser seed that we have developed recently in order tomake the whole high power narrow linewidth pulsed fiber lasertransmitter compact and expandable to spaceborne or UAV platforms. Inxxxxxx I, one new SM PM LC-EYPhF fiber with large core of 25 micron willbe fabricated and two power amplifier stages using NP's large corehighly co-doped Er/Yb phosphate glass fibers will be implemented inorder to demonstrate 5-kW peak power and 2.5-mJ pulse energy withSBS-free for xxxxxx active remote sensing fiber laser pulses at 765 nmby using NP's SINGLE-xxxxxxE phosphate fiber amplifiers.	13052
Autonomous Phase-Space Mapping and Navigation for Spacecraft Operations in Extreme Orbital Environments	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	The objective of the proposed research is to generate a suite of algorithms for the autonomous navigation of highly nonlinear orbital regimes. These algorithms must fulfill several tasks, beginning with the computationally efficient generation of a map between the spacecrafts available maneuvering options and their corresponding trajectories. This map must then be automatically classified and organized based upon the outcome of each trajectory, such as escape, collision, or safe residence within the system. xxxxxxly, a planning algorithm must utilize this information to select a maneuver that optimally satisfies the safety requirements and science goals of the mission.Extensive consideration will be given to a variety of numerical integrators, ranging from traditional integrators such as xxxxxx method to energy-conserving symplectic integrators, for the most efficient propagation of individual trajectories. Computational expenses will be further managed by actively rediscretizing the total map of the system as particular regions are discovered to be nearly uniform or finely detailed. To aid in classification, the system map will be described within six-dimensional phase space, where each dimension represents one state variable of the spacecraft. Due to the property of uniqueness, sets of points may be conceptualized as enclosing volumes, which propagate through time as non-intersecting tubes within the phase-space. Once all mapped phase tubes have been classified, nonviable maneuvers will be discarded. Finally, a planning algorithm will select a maneuver to optimally satisfy an objective function derived from science goals, fuel policies, and other mission requirements.The proposed autonomous navigation algorithm would enable breakthrough abilities for science and exploration missions. Long-term orbits could be achieved about planetary satellites such as xxxxxx and xxxxxx, which are prime destinations of interest for astrobiological research due to the potential existence of tidally heated subsurface oceans of liquid water. Additionally, close proximity operations, landing, and sampling could be conducted at comets and asteroids. These bodies are desirable targets for the study of the early chemistry of the solar system, likely containing clues about planet formation and the origin of life-enabling organic compounds. xxxxxxened autonomous navigation abilities would even prove useful for various methods of asteroid deflection, such as the dispersion of albedo-altering particles to cause a change in solar radiation pressure. The numerous technological benefits of the proposed research directly support the interests of xxxxxx and the NSTRF program.	13053
Low Erosion Ceramic Composite Liners for Improved Performance of Ablative Rocket Thrust Chambers, Phase I	2009-01-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxanced liquid rocket propulsion systems must achieve longer burn times without performance degradation to allow the lowest cost per kilogram access to space. Ablative thrust chambers have an extensive heritage and are the low cost approach to fabricating rocket thrust chambers. xxxxxxver, composite ablative chambers suffer from erosion that typically limitsperformance of the engine in terms of burn time and efficiency/performance of the combustion. In the last decade, there hasbeen significant interest in utilizing fiber-reinforced ceramic composites such as carbon fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (C/xxxxxx) composites. Such composites have demonstrated a low erosion rate in bi-propellant liquid rocket thrust chambers at temperatures approaching 4000F. xxxxxxver insertion of these materials have been limited by complexities associated with required system redesign to accommodate a radiatively-cooled chamber, attachment methods, and addressing chamberpermeability issues. By incorporating a ceramic composite liner within an ablative thrust chamber in critical areas that are subjected to the highest temperatures, a low erosion, high performance chamber is obtained that eliminates costs and complexities that have limited the insertion of ceramic composite thrust chambers. The xxxxxx I effort will produce a ceramic composite lined ablative thrust chamber, identify the degree of film cooling required and conduct a static hot fire test evaluationof the material to demonstrate the perfromance benefit of a CMC liner within an ablative thrust chamber.	13054

As humans arrive therobots should be able to shift to providing direct assistance to humanexploration activities.  Such tasks require a new generation of roboticvehicles -- a generation that has flexible, dexterous manipulationcapabilities and adjustable software controllers that can shift betweenremote teleoperation, autonomy and co-located human interaction.  Ourinnovation consists of two components.  The first component is areconfigurable, dexterous manipulator that is designed to be mounted ona mobile robot.  The manipulator will be light-weight and low-power.  Itwill contain a reconfigurable number of up to seven degrees-of-freedom.The second component is a software system that can adjust control of themanipulator from teleoperated to autonomous and that can control themobile robot and the manipulator as a coordinated unit.  We propose toimplement a method called Coordinated xxxxxxolved Motion Control that willautomatically and jointly control the rover as well as the manipulatorsuch that the manipulator will stay away from singularities.  Togetherthese two innovations will substantially increase the capabilities ofxxxxxx rovers, making them more efficient and effective.	13055

Access to much of this discovery space will depend upon the ability to both measure and control instrument pointing to high precision. The Experiment: The Precision High xxxxxx Star xxxxxx (PHAST) is an unpressurized, high-precision, high-bandwidth star tracker for night and day operations aboard scientific ballooncraft.

Efficient Space Hardy Thermoelectric Materials with Broad Temperature Range, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	The goal of this work is developing new thermoelectric materials for use in fabricating solid state cooling devices and electrical power generators, which are 200 to 300% more efficient than current thermoelectric materials and can operate in temperatures ranging from cryogenic to 700 C.  These materials will be made from new nano-composites, using fabrication techniques developed at Eltron. The proposed thermoelectric composite's matrix has already demonstrated exceptional ability for functioning in the environment of space.  Used in a cooling system, these materials will provide an effective means for controlling the temperature of surfaces subject to the rapidly changing temperatures encountered in space.  They can be used to prevent development of large temperature gradients and thereby prevent the mechanical stresses that accompany them.  Used for power-generation, these new materials will be very efficient both because of the properties that the nano-phase materials and its matrix bring to the thermoelectric material.  Because of the difficulties presented in the harsh environment of space, thermal management and power generation is most easily provided through devices that do not have any moving parts, are very durable, do not require maintenance, and operate efficiently over a wide range of temperatures.  The proposed materials meet all these requirements.	13061

Ultra-Low-Power High-Frequency Micro-Vortex Generators for Transonic Flow Control, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx flow control to prevent or delay boundary layer separation dramatically improves the performance of air vehicles in critical regions of the flight envelope. FlexSys xxxxxx. has designed a compact, efficient, electromechanical High-Frequency xxxxxx-xxxxxx xxxxxx system (HiMVG) and tested it a subsonic speeds, proving that, when tuned to the boundary layer, it is as effective at promoting flow attachment as that of the best oscillatory pneumatic systems but is light-weight and energy-efficient, consuming a maximum 6 watts of power per actuator. We propose to enhance the HiMVG system by further reducing its power consumption, increasing its maximum oscillating frequency, and demonstrating its effectiveness at transonic speeds. The proposed system will have a tunable natural frequency, so that as the flow velocity changes, we can adjust the HiMVG system's natural frequency to match the optimal vortex generator frequency, allowing us to maintain nearly constant, ultra-low-power consumption. This will allow effective flow control for diverse flight conditions. The system will consume very little power - less than one watt per actuator - allowing large arrays to operate using light-weight, compact power supplies. These improvements will make the HiMVG system feasible for a wide variety of situations where active flow control is necessary, from subsonic through transonic conditions.	13065
Ultra-Lightweight Compact Heat Exchangers for Aerospace Applications, Phase I	2017-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx environmental and thermal control systems make use of a variety of heat exchangers and condensers to provide clean water and maintain component temperatures at acceptable levels. In many cases these heat exchangers and condensers are fabricated using passivated stainless steel to retard corrosion and fouling processes, representing a significant weight penalty even for heat exchangers with minimal solid material. Leveraging extensive experience in the design and fabrication of ultra-compact heat exchangers, evaporators, and condensers using photochemically etched thin metal laminates, microVection has developed a concept for fabricating ultra-lightweight compact microfinned heat exchangers using 3-D printing technology. The concept involves 3-D printing a frame using relatively low-cost resins, followed by fully-dense plating of the frame to produce the desired heat exchanger feature dimensions. Heat exchanger fabrication is completed through heating in a furnace to remove the frame. The result is a heat exchanger that possesses all of the benefits of a laminated microfinned heat exchanger without the design constraints of continuous load paths through the structure. The proposed effort supports the xxxxxx goal of reducing the mass and increasing the efficiency of heat acquisition components (per the 2015 xxxxxx xxxxxx, TA 1xxxxxx Heat Acquisition). Specific goals of the program are to design a heat exchanger with a performance metric below 0.4 kg/kW-K, eliminate the need for bonded/brazed joints, and demonstrate the ability to fabricate the concept.	13066

Large Payload HIAD Systems: Structural Investigation and Optimization	2019-08-01	2018-07-19	This proposal seeks to advance the understanding of full-scale Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerators (HIADs) in support of xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx, TABS element 9.1.4, Deployable Hypersonic Aeroshells. The HIAD system is a low technology readiness level (xxxxxx) space technology that has the potential to deliver the size of payloads that will be required for human missions to xxxxxx. The current state of the art xxxxxx payload delivery is estimated at 1.5 metric tons. xxxxxxver, payloads on the order of 20 to 60 metric tons will be required for a successful human mission to xxxxxx. Upwards of a 40 fold increase in payload mass represents a significant jump from the currently available decelerator technology.The HIAD system consists of multiple, inflatable tori that are strapped together other around a rigid center-body in a cone configuration and are covered with a thermal protection shield. The individual tori consist of a flexible fabric shell with integral axial cords that are rigidified by the inflation pressure. The HIAD system offers considerable benefits from traditional rigid aeroshells including a small storage volume and a mass to area ratio that is not constrained by the size of the launch vehicle. The HIAD system can be effective in thin atmospheres.Work to date has focused on quantifying the structural behavior of HIAD materials, structural components and test-scale HIAD structures, (3 m major diameter). xxxxxxhough engineers have had success modeling the HIAD system at the test-scale, there is still much unknown about how the structure will behave at a full or human-scale, (~20 m major diameter). Scalability remains one of the major technical challenges associated with deployable aeroshells.Design exploration and optimization of human-scale HIAD structures are important next steps in the development of the HIAD technology. A critical component is the development of computationally efficient structural analysis methods. xxxxxx efforts to date have focused on high-fidelity yet computationally expensive shell-based finite element (FE) modeling. This work proposes to develop computationally inexpensive three-dimensional beam-based FE models to analyze the HIAD system. Since the HIAD consists of multiple, slender, inflatable members, it is a good candidate for beam based FE modeling. The analysis tool will necessarily incorporate both large deformations and nonlinear material constitutive relationships to accurately capture the structural response of the inflatable members. The HIAD system will be modeled with torus and strap elements as well as elements between tori to capture tori interaction. The material and component level models will be validated with an extensive set of existing test data.xxxxxxing a beam-element-based simulation technology will allow for exploration of optimal HIAD configuration and will greatly enhancing our understanding of the HIAD structure. The use of optimization methods to explore the feasible design space can often lead to non-intuitive designs and configurations. For example, exploring non-axisymmetric designs or designs incorporating a radial spoke configuration from the center body to the outer torus are configurations that have not been considered, but are possible feasible alternatives that can be readily explored with the methods envisioned.xxxxxxment of a comprehensive beam based FE tool will facilitate the efficient exploration of the human-scale HIAD design space and will increase our understanding of the behavior of the low-xxxxxx HIAD space technology. Major technological challenges associated with deployable aeroshells remain. In order to further the technology and ensure that the HIAD system will one day be capable of accommodating the requirements of a crewed mission to xxxxxx, further investigations into the behavior of the system at the full-scale are required.	13068
Rugged, Compact, and Inexpensive Airborne Fiber Sensor Interrogator Based on a Monolithic Tunable Laser, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	In this program, Freedom Photonics will develop and build a robust, low C-SWaP laser source with improved performance over current technology, to be incorporated into improved FOS interrogator systems. The laser will be 40nm continuously tunable around C-band, with fast sweep rate. The laser interrogator module to be developed will be based on our advanced monolithic, fast-tunable laser and receiver technology, leading to ultra-low SWaP with smaller FOS laser interrogator module, two orders of magnitude smaller than existing technology, and interrogator mass less than 100 grams. The configuration will be rugged, compatible with fuel, fuel vapor, shock, and vibration.	13069
High Order Wavelet-Based Multiresolution Technology for Airframe Noise Prediction, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	An integrated framework is proposed for efficient prediction of rotorcraft and airframe noise. A novel wavelet-based multiresolution technique and high-order accurate WENO scheme is proposed for efficient capturing of noise sources and unsteady flowfield. A wavelet compression is used to store the flowfield as a multi-level representation in functional space. The primary solution progresses using a coarse grid. The regularity of the flow field data is used to identify regions of steep variation. These regions are selectively solved recursively in the finer grid-levels and accurate information is injected into the coarse grids to correctly represent all flow features. In xxxxxx I, a three-dimensional wavelet-based multiresolution algorithm, and an acoustic analogy module based on xxxxxx and Hawking methodology will be developed. The feasibility of the proposed technology will be demonstrated by prediction of three-dimensional noise source and acoustic waves of vortex-blade interaction problems. The proposed technology will provide 2-3 orders-of-magnitude reductions in CPU requirements over existing techniques. In xxxxxx, the wavelet compression methodology will be integrated into a high-fidelity CFD module. An efficient data structure will be developed to store and update the multiresolution data. The modules will be coupled with a nonlinear finite-element structure dynamic module for noise prediction of flexible structures.	13070
Novel Long-Term CO2 Removal System, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	Current xxxxxx for xxxxxx removal from enclosed air of spacecraft utilizes LiOH canisters for xxxxxx absorption.  This absorption is irreversible so longer flights require more LiOH.  For long duration flights it is essential that a small, lightweight system that recovers the xxxxxx be developed.  This allows the xxxxxx to be used to regenerate O2 for re-use.xxxxxx systems (CMS) has identified a novel membrane contactor process for absorption and subsequent desorption of the xxxxxx.  xxxxxx to the process is that the contactor both operate effectively and that loss of the absorption/desorption fluid be kept to a minimum.In xxxxxx I, CMS will build system and demonstrate systems capability with a focus on key desorption unit operation.  xxxxxx will demonstrate ability to transport xxxxxx while maintaining minimal loss of absorbent.  xxxxxx stability will be demonstrated by evaluating performance over wide temperature range (30-90o C).  Chemical stability with absorbants will also be demonstrated.  With all the above basic data in hand, we will evaluate the needed system size, weight and power consumption.  Lastly we will compare results to molecular sieve adsorbants which are the incumbent for long duration flights.	13071

Revolutionize Propulsion Test Facility High-Speed Video Imaging with Disruptive Computational Photography Enabling Technology	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxanced rocket propulsion testing requires high-speed video recording that can capture essential information for xxxxxx during rocket engine flight certification ground testing. While it is important to assess all anomalies during testing, this is particularly true in the event of a mishap. The video recording in use today at xxxxxx&rsquo;s xxxxxx (SSC) is significantly outdated and in need of the revolutionary approach being proposed. The current system has poor resolution and records to VHS tapes that are no longer commercially available. The system has been partially upgraded by incorporating consumer grade digital cameras, but these cameras have significant limitations including plume saturation and on-board memory storage, which make it nearly impossible, in catastrophic situations that result in the loss of a camera, to obtain critical information. This project will design and build a state-of-the-art high-speed video recording system using disruptive technologies based on emerging advances made in the field of computational photography. This system will not only provide quality, high-speed, 3-D high dynamic range video to the SSC engine test complex, but the technologies developed will be extendable to other xxxxxx priorities including launch monitoring and space-based rover and robotics missions.&nbsp;This project will design and build a novel state-of-the-art high-speed video recording system to provide 3-D High Dynamic xxxxxx (HDR) video imagery for operational use on the SSC engine test stands. The system will leverage newly emerging algorithms being developed within the computational photography discipline. Computational photography expands digital photography by applying computational image capture, processing, and manipulation techniques to improve image quality. HDR imaging effectively increases a camera&rsquo;s dynamic range and eliminates saturation. Juxtaposed with current imaging techniques, which often utilize either multiple cameras or a single camera with multiple exposure sequencing, the transformative approach will be implemented at the chip level using a single camera, which significantly reduces cost and implementation complexities. Three such cameras will provide multiple viewing, enabling high-speed 3-D HDR imagery, important for a more robust analysis.	13073

High Order Wavelet-Based Multiresolution Technology for Airframe Noise Prediction, Phase II	2006-11-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop a novel, high-accuracy, high-fidelity, multiresolution (MRES), wavelet-based framework for efficient prediction of airframe noise sources and acoustic propagation. In xxxxxx I, 2D and 3D models of MRES methodology were developed. An acoustic analogy module based on xxxxxx and Hawking technique was developed to accurately propagate the near-field acoustic signals to far field with minimal dissipation and dispersion. An innovative xxxxxxge-Kutta temporal update was developed to advance all grid levels independently. The feasibility and accuracy of the MRES technology was demonstrated by predicting noise sources and acoustic waves generated by vortex shedding. The xxxxxx I results indicate that the proposed technology will provide up to two orders-of-magnitude reductions in CPU time over existing techniques.In xxxxxx, we propose to improve the 3D MRES software to handle multi-block, curvilinear, viscous and massively parallel applications. An efficient data structure will be developed and implemented to store and update the multiresolution data to improve the cost-saving factor. Unsteady turbulence models based on DES and PANS will be implemented to better resolve the sources of noise. The acoustic module will be improved to account for surface motions and quadrupole source terms. The developed modules will then be coupled to a large-scale CFD code to expand the application base of the technology. The technology will be demonstrated and validated using typical aeroacoustic applications such as Energy Efficient Transport (EET) airfoils and landing gear models.	13075
Thermal Pyrolytic Graphite Enhanced Components, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	Peregrine's innovation will reduce the required input power, increase a coolers systems margin for a giving cooling load and reduce vibration accordingly for Reverse-xxxxxx xxxxxxcoolers.  Our innovation will enhance the thermal conductivities of structures associated with the cryocooler, enable much more efficient heat removal and thereby produce a much more efficient system.  Effectively we will be increasing the thermal conductivities of the structures associated with the cryocoolers by embedding Thermal Pyrolytic Graphite within a matrix of material to produce a thermal conductivity 3 times higher than current available materials.  At the end of xxxxxx I Peregrine will have demonstrated the feasibility of our innovation and laid out a detailed design and test plan for xxxxxx.  At the end of xxxxxx Peregrine will have produced a flight like product tested for future satellite applications.  xxxxxx will also incorporate characterization of the material and engineering guidelines.As cryocooler technologies attempt to cool components down around the 4oK level waste heat and the management thereof becomes critical to the performance of the cryocooler.  Thermal conductivity structures that can eliminate thermal loads more effectively will lead to a more efficient and better performing cryocooler.	13076
Innovative Solid State Lighting Replacements for Industrial and Test Facility Locations, Phase I	2011-01-01	2018-07-19	The proposed innovation is the replacement of existing test stand and parking lot  fixtures with current SSL LED technology. The replacement fixtures will reduce energy consumption, generate less heat and provide maintenance free operation for over 50,000 hours. An explosion-proof fixture is capable of containing an internal combustion event without allowing flames or hot gasses to escape to the surrounding environment. The lighting fixture defined is an explosion-proof fixture for use in hazardous hydrogen/oxygen atmospheres. Current fixtures contain a 110 xxxxxx reflectored incandescent lamp. SSL sources are remarkably efficient compared to incandescent sources. The 110 xxxxxx lamp in existing explosion-proof fixtures will be replaced by an SSL fixture requiring only around 29 xxxxxx for the equivalent lighting output.  The proposed Energy Focus solution will be an efficient, solid-state, explosion-proof  fixture for use in hydrogen/oxygen atmospheres which is compatible with current systems and provides the required lighting distribution. It will do this through advanced thermal and electrical power management to ensure long fixture life	13077
CloudTurbine: Streaming Data via Cloud File Sharing, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	"We propose a novel technology to leverage rapidly evolving cloud based infrastructure to improve time constrained situational awareness for real-time decision making.  Our \"xxxxxxTurbine\" innovation eliminates the distinction between files and streams to distribute live streaming sensor and video data over cloud file sharing services.  Streaming and static data have long been considered separately, with unique mechanisms for data transmittal and viewing of each.  Files are the greatest common denominator linking static data across all computers.  xxxxxxver, real-time streaming data distribution is widely presumed to be sensor-centric; i.e. up-front requirements to \"keep up\" with live data trump all other considerations.  A great unification of cloud based services for static data has recently occurred.  There are now many providers of \"file sharing\" cloud based services. The paradigm for all is simple:  (1) put data in a local file folder, (2) it automatically shows up at other linked systems via a cloud service.  Wouldn't it be nice if one could unify an approach to streaming data that leveraged this file-sharing cloud infrastructure?  That is precisely what we propose. xxxxxxing upon a functional prototype, we propose to characterize, evaluate, refine and adapt xxxxxxTurbine technology to xxxxxx and commercial applications.  xxxxxxTurbine is a streaming data interface to and from standard file sharing cloud services. It delegates much of the data transmittal, security, and server resources to the cloud service provider.  It provides robust continuous streaming for high data and frame rates while trading off manageable amounts of delivery latency (on the order of seconds). In so doing, it eliminates the distinction between files and streams, and enables a simple, cost effective new paradigm for streaming data middleware."	13078
Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis Algorithms for Discrete Symbols	2010-09-22	2018-07-19	We present a set of novel algorithms which we call sequenceMiner that detect and characterize anomalies in large sets of high-dimensional symbol sequences that arise from recordings of switch sensors in the cockpits of commercial airliners. While the algorithms we present are general and domain-independent, we focus on a specific problem that is critical to determining the system-wide health of a fleet of aircraft. The approach taken usesunsupervised clustering of sequences using the normalized length of the longest common subsequence (nLCS) as a similarity measure, followed by detailed outlier analysis to detect anomalies. In this method, an outlier sequence is defined as a sequence that is far away from the cluster centre. We present new algorithms for outlier analysis that provide comprehensible indicators as to why a particular sequence is deemed to be an outlier. The algorithms provide a coherent description to an analyst of the anomalies in the sequence when compared to more normal sequences. In the final section of the paper we demonstrate the effectiveness of sequenceMiner for anomaly detection on a real set of discrete sequence data from a fleet of commercial airliners. We show that sequenceMiner discovers actionable and operationally significant safety events. We also compare our innovations with standard Hiddenxxxxxxs, and show that our methods are superior.	13079

Fine Grained Tungsten Claddings for Cermet Based NTP Systems, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	In October 2011, xxxxxx initiated the Nuclear xxxxxxgenic Propulsion Stage (NCPS) program to evaluate the feasibility and affordability of Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP).  A critical aspect of the program is to develop a robust, stable nuclear fuel.  One of the nuclear fuel configurations currently being evaluated is a cermet-based material comprised of uranium dioxide particles encased in a tungsten matrix.  To prevent excessive fuel loss from reaction with the hot hydrogen gas passing through the cooling channels, both the internal surfaces of the cooling channels and the exterior of the fuel element must be clad with a hydrogen compatible material such as tungsten.  To reduce the potential for uranium hydride formation that can lead to grain boundary separation and cracking, the diffusion of hydrogen into the cermet must be minimized.  Therefore, fine-grained tungsten claddings are needed.  Recently, advanced electrochemical processing techniques (EL-Form&#61666;) have been developed that enable the tailoring of refractory metal microstructures through process parameter manipulation and/or alloy additions.  Therefore, these innovative electrochemical forming techniques will be used to produce fine-grained, hermetic tungsten claddings for both the internal and external surfaces of cermet based nuclear fuel elements.	13084

VOYAGER 1 JUP LOW ENERGY CHARGED PARTICLE CALIB. BR 15MIN	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	THIS BROWSE DATA CONSISTS OF RExxxxxxLED DATA FROM THE LOW ENERGY CHARxxxxxx PARTICLE (LECP) EXPERIMENT ON VOYAGER 1 WHILE THE SPACECRAFT WAS IN THE VICINITY OF JUPITER. THIS INSTRUMENT MEASURES THE INTENSITIES OF IN-SITU CHARxxxxxx PARTICLES (>26 KEV ELECTRONS AND >30 KEV IONS) WITH VARIOUS LEVELS OF DISCRIMIxxxxxxION BASED ON ENERGY, MASS SPECIES, AND ANGULAR ARRIVAL DIRECTION. A SUBSET OF ALMOST 100 LECP CHANNELS ARE INCLUDED WITH THIS DATA SET. THE LECP DATA ARE GLOBALLY CAxxxxxxTED TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE (SEE BELOW) AND THEY ARE TIME AVERAxxxxxx TO ABOUT 15 MINUTE TIME INTERVALS WITH THE EXxxxxxx BEGINNING AND ENDING TIMES FOR THOSE INTERVALS MATCHING THE LECP INSTRUMENTAL CYCLE PERIODS (THE ANGULAR SCANNING PERIODS). THE LECP INSTUMENT HAS A ROTATING HEAD FOR OBTAINING ANGULAR ANISOTROPY MEASUREMENTS OF THE xxxxxx ENERGY CHARxxxxxx PARTICLES THAT IT MEASURES. THE CYCLE TIME FOR THE ROTATION IF VARIABLE, BUT DURING ENCOUNTERS IT IS ALWAYS FASTER THAN 15 MINUTES. FOR THIS BROWSE DATA SET ONLY SCAN AVERAGE DATA IS GIVEN (NO ANGULAR INFORMATION). THE DATA IS IN THE FORM OF 'RATE' DATA WHICH HAS NOT BEEN CONVERTED TO THE USUAL PHYSICAL UNITS. THE REASON IS THAT SUCH A CONVERSION WOULD DEPEND ON UNCERTAIN DETERMIxxxxxxIONS SUCH AS THE MASS SPECIES OF THE PARTICLES AND THE LEVEL OF BACKGROUND. BOTH MASS SPECIES AND BACKGROUND ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED FROM CONTEXT DURING THE STUDY OF PARTICULAR REGIONS. TO CONVERT 'RATE' TO 'INTENSITY' FOR A PARTICULAR CHANNEL ONE PERFORMS THE FOLLOWING TASKS: 1) DECIDE ON THE LEVEL OF BACKGROUND CONTAMIxxxxxxION AND xxxxxx THAT OFF THE GIVEN RATE LEVEL. BACKGROUND IS TO BE DETERMINED FROM CONTEXT AND FROM MAKING USE OF SECTOR 8 RATES (SECTOR 8 HAS A 2 mm AL SHIELD COVERING IT). 2) xxxxxxIDE THE BACKGROUND CORRECTED RATE BY THE CHANNEL GEOMETRIC xxxxxxxxxxOR AND BY THE ENERGY BANxxxxxxS OF THE CHANNEL. THE GEOMETRIC xxxxxxxxxxOR IS FOUND IN ENTRY 'channel_geometric_ factor' AS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH CHANNEL 'channel_id'. TO DETERMINE THE ENERGY BANxxxxxxS, ONE MUST JUDGE THE MASS SPECIES OF THE OF THE DETECTED PARTICLES (FOR IONS BUT NOT FOR ELECTRONS). THE ENERGY BAND PASSES ARE GIVEN IN ENTRIES 'minimum_instrument_parameter' and 'maximum_instrument_ parameter' IN TABLE 'FPLECPENERGY', AND ARE GIVEN IN THE FORM 'ENERGY/NUCLEON'. FOR CHANNELS THAT BEGIN THEIR NAMES WITH THE DESIGxxxxxxIONS 'CH' THESE BANxxxxxxSES CAN BE USED ON MASS SPECIES THAT ARE xxxxxxED INTO THAT CHANNEL (SEE ENTRIES 'minimum_instrument_parameter' and 'maximum_instrument_ parameter' IN TABLE 'xxxxxx', WHICH GIVE THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM 'Z' VALUE xxxxxxED -- THESE ENTRIES ARE BLANK FOR ELECTRON CHANNELS). FOR OTHER CHANNELS THE GIVEN BANxxxxxxS REFERS ONLY TO THE LOWEST 'Z' VALUE xxxxxxED. THE BANxxxxxxSES FOR OTHER 'Z' VALUES ARE NOT ALL KNOWN, BUT SOME ARE GIVEN IN THE LITERATURE (E.G. KRIMIGIS ET AL., 1979). THE FINAL PRODUCT OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE THE PARTICLE INTENSITY WITH THE UNITS: COUNTS/(CM**2.STR.SEC.KEV). SOME CHANNELS ARE SUBJECT TO SERIOUS CONTAMIxxxxxxIONS, AND MANY OF THESE CONTAMIxxxxxxIONS CANNOT BE REMOVED EXCEPT WITH A REGION-BY-REGION ANALYSIS, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN DONE FOR THIS DATA. THUS, TO USE THIS DATA IT IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL THAT THE CONTAMIxxxxxxION TYPES ('contamination_id' , 'contamination_desc') AND THE LEVELS OF CONTAMIxxxxxxION ('data_quality_id' CORRESPONDING TO THE DEFINITIONS 'data_quality_desc') BE CAREFULLY EXAMINED FOR ALL REGIONS OF STUDY. A DEAD TIME CORRECTION PxxxxxxEDURE HAS BEEN APPLIED IN AN ATTEMPT TO CORRECT THE LINEAR EFFECTS OF DETECTOR OVExxxxxxIVE (PULSE-PILEUP). THIS PxxxxxxEDURE DOES NOT FIX SEVERELY OVExxxxxxIVEN DETECTORS.

Multifunctional Coating for Crew Cabin Surfaces and Fabrics, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx crewed spacecrafts require routine cleaning of particulate, moisture, organic, and salt contaminants on the crew cabin surfaces and fabrics. Self-cleaning surfaces will help in reducing the crew's effort in cleaning the cabin and reduce the amount of wipes used for cleaning. It will also be beneficial if the surfaces can be made antimicrobial to reduce the health risks of the crew members. xxxxxx treatments also should be durable for 3 to 5 years long missions. In the proposed xxxxxx I effort, a novel multifunctional coating will be developed which has both superhydrophobic and antimicrobial properties. xxxxxx treatment of cabin crew surfaces do not resist the accumulation of contaminants on the surfaces. In the proposed xxxxxx I Materials xxxxxxfication xxxxxx. (MMI) will develop a multifunctional coating for providing antimicrobial and self-cleaning properties to the spacecraft crew cabin surfaces based on its superhydrophobic technology.

Resource Prospector Project	2023-05-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxource Prospector (RP) is an in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) capability demonstration activity currently planned for launch to he xxxxxx in 2022. Expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit to asteroids and xxxxxx will require the maximum possible utilization of local materials &mdash; so-called in-situ resources.RP will be a first effort to validate prospecting, extraction, and analysis of planetary surface resources for the express purpose of resource utilization.&nbsp; RP will be able to find water (in the form of ice or hydrated minerals), extract it, process it and store it. &nbsp;In addition to ISRU validation, RP will be able to characterize the distribution of water and other volatiles at the lunar poles, enabling future innovative uses of local resources. The knowledge gained by RP&nbsp;should also be useful for exploring near-Earth asteroids and xxxxxx, and could reduce the overall risks of human exploration. Through the RP demonstration, xxxxxx may be able to determine if lunar resources can be harvested to support future deep space missions. xxxxxxource Prospector is designed to prospect the lunar surface, create maps of the nature and distribution of volatiles, and then demonstrate processing while on the lunar surface.RP consists of a lunar lander, lunar rover, and five key ISRU elements: two prospecting instruments for locating potentially viable materials, a sample acquisition system (drill &amp; sample transfer system), an oven for heating samples, and a volatile analysis system for determining the volatile composition within samples. &nbsp;After landing, RP will rove across and map the lunar surface using neutron and near-IR (NIR) spectrometers to look for hydrogen-rich materials. The rover will be capable of entering permanently-shadowed areas, which contain the highest concentrations of volatiles, and use the drill subsystem to bring material from a one-meter depth to examine with the near-IR spectrometer. After high fidelity volatiles are found, the RP drill subsystem will capture samples, transfer them to the OVEN subsystem, and then heat them to 150&deg;C to enable characterization of the essential elements.In order to prospect for volatiles, RP must be able to travel over the lunar surface. As surface operations begin, continuous observations from the neutron spectrometer, provide bulk hydrogen understanding down to 1m, and the NIR spectrometer, provides surface hydration and minerology. The maps that RP creates of the volatile concentrations can be used for drill site selection and excavation. When the rover moves into permanently shadowed regions (PSR&#39;s) - where the greatest volatiles concentrations are located - the RP payload subsystems will capture volatiles from the lunar regolith to process and characterize the essential elements.xxxxxx on landing site, RP&#39;s operations will last a minimum of seven days but could be extended to four weeks or more with continued advancements in site selection and traverse planning. xxxxxxource Prospector is in xxxxxx-A development, currently maturing flight planning, requirements, and interfaces definition.In 2015 the RP team greatly reduced risk and furthered flight design maturity by building &quot;RP15&quot; - a &quot;mission-in-a-year&quot; rover/payload system which was able to rove, drill, and process materials here on Earth, similar to how RP would operate on the moon. In only 12 months,&nbsp;RP15 was conceived, developed, built, tested, and operated as an xxxxxxterrestrial prototype system. This RP15 terrestrial rover system, which includes an ISRU prototype system, was operated just as it would be during the actual RP lunar mission. RP has continued to mature its mission concept. During 2016 and 2017 the team conducted numerous hardware tests, including conducting analogue testing in the field and in microgravity simulators, as well as environmental chamber testing. The team continues to develop new tools and data sets for traverse planning.	13088

Improved Foreign Object Damage Performance for 3D Woven Ceramic Matrix Composites, Phase II	2016-11-01	2018-07-19	As the power density of advanced engines increases, the need for new materials that are capable of higher operating temperatures, such as ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), is critical for turbine hot-section static and rotating components. Such advanced materials have demonstrated the promise to significantly increase the engine temperature capability relative to conventional super alloy metallic blades. They also show the potential to enable longer life, reduced emissions, growth margin, reduced weight and increased performance relative to super alloy blade materials.MR&D is proposed a program focused on improving the impact resistance of CMCs using 3D woven reinforcement. This approach was shown in the xxxxxx I program to hold promise for increased performance is of specific interest to Rolls Royce as a candidate material for vanes and blades in their turbine engines. MR&D will expand the capability of its analysis tool which was developed during the xxxxxx I program by incorporating failure criteria tailored for 3D woven preforms as well as executing analyses to predict the exact locations of the fiber tows after weaving. Along with impact testing, an expansive testing program to characterize multiple 3D fiber architectures will be executed.

Micro-atmospheric Microwell Plate Technology Project	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	Valuable research in gravitational biology, synthetic biology, proteomics, and biotechnology can be enhanced by using microwell platforms. The microwell platform provides a simple technique for doing massively parallel studies.&nbsp; xxxxxxver, to be effectively used in microgravity significant improvements in our ability to manage gases in these systems is needed. We are developing a system that addresses these limitations.&nbsp; This research enables a wide range foundational research in xxxxxx xxxxxx, Fundamental xxxxxx, and xxxxxx, ultimately generating the knowledge required to engineer a potentially broad range of space biotechnology applications employing synthetic organisms and microbial bioreactors for in situ resource utilization and biological life support systems. xxxxxxwell-plates have become standardized formats for biological research. xxxxxxver, valuable biological microgravity research cannot be accomplished using these technologies without improvements in our ability to deliver, remove, and measure gases.In microgravity, where buoyancy driven mixing is minimal, the buildup of xxxxxx in solutions containing aerobic bacteria can adversely impact growth rates and mask more subtle effects. Likewise, the delivery of O2 and removal of metabolic by-products at the bottom of a microwell in microgravity is difficult to achieve and even more difficult to measure.&nbsp; Gas that builds up and is not removed will supersaturate the growth medium and form bubbles causing interference with detection and analysis.What is needed is a standard microwell-plate that is sealed with a transparent cover slip and has the capability to control, mix, and measure gas concentrations inside the microwells. To accomplish this requires the integration of a range of state-of-the-art micro and nano technologies such as micro-sensors that measure gas concentrations of O2, N2, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, NO and some organics.&nbsp; Also needed are technologies that add O2 and N2 to micro-atmospheres; remove xxxxxx, NO, xxxxxx, and organics; as well as micro-technologies that can control gas mixing, and gas circulation in micro-atmospheres.This CIF grant developed an initial feasibility study of a sealed micro well that can measure and control the micro atmosphere contained in individual micro wells.&nbsp; This system uses carbon nanotube sensors to measure gas concentrations at a nano scale within the microwell.&nbsp; Gas phase adsorbents are used as gas reservoirs to add and remove atmospheric/metabolic gases from the well.&nbsp; xxxxxx pumps and valves are used to circulate gases and insure good mixing in the well.	13093
Advanced, Long-Life Cryocooler Technology for Zero-Boil-Off Cryogen Storage, Phase II	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	Long-life, high-capacity cryocoolers are a critical need for future space systems utilizing stored cryogens.  The cooling requirements for planetary and extraterrestrial exploration missions, xxxxxx Exploration Vehicles, extended-life orbital transfer vehicles, and space depots will range from 10 to 50 W at temperatures between 20 and 120 K.  xxxxxx cryocoolers are ideal for these systems because they are lightweight, compact and very efficient at high cooling loads, in addition to their inherent attributes of high reliability; negligible vibration; long, maintenance-free lifetimes; and flexibility in integrating with spacecraft systems and payloads.  To date, space-borne turbo-xxxxxx technology has been developed for modest cooling loads.  During the proposed program, Creare will develop an advanced, high efficiency turbine optimized for a high-capacity cryocooler.  The advanced turbine will enable a landmark reduction in cryocooler input power and overall cooling system mass.  In xxxxxx I, we defined the cryocooler requirements for a particular mission class, developed the conceptual design of a multistage cryocooler to meet the requirements, developed the preliminary design of the advanced turbine and successfully performed proof-of-concept tests on the turbine.  During xxxxxx, we will fabricate the turbine optimized to provide 5-20 W of net refrigeration at 20 K and demonstrate its performance at prototypical operating conditions.	13094

In this proposal we will pursue enabling technologies for such a thruster, such as a passive feedsystem and an isolation membrane for separating the propellant in the reservoir from the thruster head prior to launch.  xxxxxxancements to date suggest viable approaches for the development of a cost-effective, reliable, and flexible thruster configuration.	13096

Mouse fecal microbiome after exposure to high LET radiation	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	xxxxxx travel is associated with continuous low-dose-rate exposure to high xxxxxxar Energy Transfer (LET) radiation. xxxxxxophysiological manifestations after low-dose radiation exposure are strongly influenced by non-cytocidal radiation effects including microbiome and cellular gene expression. Using a mouse model for exposure to high LET radiation we observed substantial changes in the composition and functional potential of the microbiome. These were paralleled by changes in the abundance of multiple metabolites which were related to the enzymatic activity of the altered metagenome by means of metabolic network modeling. There was a complex dynamic in microbial and metabolic composition at different radiation doses suggestive of transient dose-dependent interactions between microbial ecology and signals from the host  s cellular damage repair processes. Functional shifts included features associated with dysbiosis at the onset of chronic inflammatory responses which could prMouse fecal microbiome after exposure to high LET radiatione-dispose space travelers to systemic long-term health risks.	13098

Microfluidic Analytical Separator for Proteomics, Phase II	2006-11-01	2018-07-19	"The proposed innovation is a microfluidic device designed to effect a 2-dimensional resolution of a mixture of proteins based on isoelectric point (pI) and molecular weight (MW).  The innovation performs tasks similar to those performed by 2-dimensional (\"2-D\") gel electrophoresis. To achieve 2-D-gel equivalence with minimal complications and maximum exploitation of the advantages provided by microfluidics a novel approach is proposed.  In this approach the user dissolves or mixes a sample to be tested for proteins into a sample buffer and injects this into a plastic card consisting of microfluidic channels and electrodes.  The card is inserted into a compact \"reader\" (small enough for space flight) that, within four hours, electronically reports the abundance of each protein detected.  In xxxxxx research SHOT will (1) establish fabrication parameters for the card and manufacture prototypes, (2) build a breadboard reader and (3) test the xxxxxxfluidic Analytical Separator using mixed protein solutions.

Building and Executing Rover Plans with Contingent Tasks, Phase I	2012-02-01	2018-07-19	During recent robotic field tests, xxxxxx investigated the use of intelligent planetary rovers to improve the productivity of human explorers on planetary surfaces. For these field tests, a remote xxxxxx built rover plans to collect data that supplements astronaut EVA and a remote xxxxxx xxxxxx supervised the execution of these plans. This model of operation requires xxxxxx to generate and revise all plans, often taking a partially executed plan and quickly updating it in response to issues that may have nothing to do with science. As a result xxxxxx pre-builds alternative plans, many of which are not used. In future exploration operations, astronauts orbiting a planet will supervise rovers operating on the surface below without benefit of real-time support from Earth because of time delay. In such cases it becomes important to provide a more flexible planning approach that permits xxxxxx to distinguish essential tasks from tasks to be performed as time and resource permit, or in response to discovery (contingent tasks). xxxxxx and Carnegie Mellon xxxxxxersity propose to build science alternatives into a single rover plan as contingent tasks, potentially reducing the time spent building plans and providing the xxxxxx xxxxxx with more flexibility when executing plans. We will identify use cases describing how xxxxxx will build plans with contingent tasks and how the xxxxxx xxxxxx will execute these plans. We will design software for use by xxxxxx to build plans with contingent tasks. We will design rover software for executing such plans and software for the xxxxxx xxxxxx to supervise this execution. We will evaluate this design for use in K10 rover operations.	13104
Microfabricated G-Band Antenna Arrays, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	This proposal addresses the need for an antenna technology platform that meets the requirements of high-performance materials, exacting dimensional tolerances, and the geometrical design freedom to enable planar antenna array technologies for frequencies greater than 100GHz.  The PolyStrata fabrication technology, being developed at Nuvotronics, LCC, xxxxxx, VA., is capable of meeting or exceeding all of the requirements outlined to be a solution for these frequencies. Air-filled copper rectangular coaxial transmission lines are fabricated using a photolithographically defined layer-by-layer process.  The resulting transmission lines are extremely broadband, low-dispersion, high-isolation, and low loss compared to other forms of planar transmission lines.  These lines are smaller than rectangular waveguides because the transverse cross-sections of the lines are not resonant. xxxxxx I of this work includes designing a frequency-scanned antenna-array operating from 140-160GHz that would provide ±16o beam steering with a beamwidth of 0.5o and 400MHz per beam bandwidth.  An antenna array with this performance would require roughly a 24cm by 24cm aperture to fabricate.  This is possible using 4 sub-arrays that each are fabricated on a single wafer and then tied together to achieve the overall system performance.  The approach will offer a high-yield, cost effective product that will meet the xxxxxx needs.	13105

Wavelength Drift Corrector for Wind Lidar Receivers, Phase I	2009-01-01	2018-07-19	We propose a key innovation to improve wavelength-sensitive lidar measurements (such as wind velocity) using photon-counting receivers. A novel binning technique to track the wavelength shifts of the outgoing laser pulses on a per-shot basis before accumulation in the receiver electronics is described. This allows creation of a narrow histogram in the backscattered signal accumulation process while using less expensive, less stable lasers than are traditionally required. This technique relaxes the stringent stability requirements on the laser, and therefore its size, weight, complexity, and cost. We propose to demonstrate the technique in existing lidars more compact and suitable for airborne platforms in terms of size, weight and power requirements of the system. We utilize recent solid-state laser and high-speed signal processing technologies in the wavelength tracking system. The direct application of the wavelength corrector is in a direct detection xxxxxx wind lidar. This innovation will significantly reduce the cost of wind lidar systems permitting their installation at airports to look for dangerous wind shears as well as for weather forecasting. Also, this innovation will significantly reduce the cost of a space-based xxxxxx wind lidar system because of the relaxed laser stability requirements.	13108
Cryogenic Clamp-on Ultrasonic Flowmeters using Single Crystal Piezoelectric Transducers, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Clamp-on ultrasound cryogenic flowmeters using single crystal piezoelectric transducers are proposed to enable reliable, accurate cryogenic instrumentation needs in support of xxxxxx xxxxxx, xxxxxx Operations, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, and xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxs programs. In-space, on the lunar surface, and on the Earth Exploration xxxxxxs architecture presents cryogenic storage, distribution, and fluid handling challenges that require new technologies to be developed. Clamp-on ultrasonic flowmeters are proposed because of their advantages such as high turn-down ratio, non-intrusive, no pressure drop, bi-directional measurement, no moving parts and fast response. Single crystal piezoelectrics are attractive because they exhibit 3 to 5 times the strain as conventional piezoelectric ceramics, and retain excellent piezoelectric performance at cryogenic temperatures (< 20 K). xxxxxxgenic piezoelectric transducers with broad bandwidth and high sensitivity will be designed, fabricated and characterized, and cryogenic gas flow rate measurements will be performed using the developed cryogenic transducers. It is expected to have 10-20 dB sensitivity gain (combining transmitting and receiving) for clamp-on ultrasonic flowmeters by using novel single crystal piezoelectric transducers.	13109

Space-qualifiable Digital Radar Transceiver, Phase I	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx technology offers a very flexible, powerful tool for applications such as object detection, tracking, and characterization, as well as remote sensing, imaging, sounding, weather measurement and analysis.  xxxxxx, radar systems have tended to be either large, complex, power-hungry, purpose-built systems, or extremely simple systems of limited capability.  More recently, miniaturization of high-performance programmable integrated circuit technologies as embodied in field-programmable gate arrays, as well as rapid advances in high-speed data conversion technologies at a gigasample per second and beyond, have enabled the implementation of direct-conversion radio frequency (RF) systems, including radar, that operate almost completely in the digital domain.  In addition, solid-state high-power RF device technologies have improved in efficiency and speed to the point where highly efficient pulsed transmit sources are possible.  As these device technologies have matured, their application in space environments has accelerated to the point where extremely flexible programmable radar systems can be implemented in a very small size, weight, and power footprint.   Trident xxxxxxs has developed a powerful radar architecture called RAPTOR, validating it through flight testing on a number of Department of Defense programs;  initial analysis has shown the feasibility of transitioning this design to the space environment.  Through a comprehensive program of requirements development, trade studies, critical component and design analyses, fault mitigation simulation, and system design, Trident will develop the design for a complete space-qualifiable UHF/L-band radar transceiver in a 96mm x 90mm x 31mm PC-104e form factor that meets all customer mission needs, and is applicable to a wide range of applications (xxxxxx and others).

High-Resolution, High-Efficiency, Curved Diffraction Gratings Fabricated by Conformable, Maskless,100-nm Lithography, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	In this program, we will develop a novel process for fabricating large-area ultraviolet diffraction gratings on curved surfaces. This process is based on a unique conformable maskless projection lithography system technology that has been developed by Anvik Corporation. The UV gratings that will be fabricated using this technology would be attractive for integration into imaging spectrometers, for example, for studying the solar corona and solar emissions, and their influence on the earth environment. In this program we will identify the patterning requirements for curved UV gratiings and we will demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating gratings using conformable maskless lithography. Anvik?s conformable maskless technology offers a number of advantages compared with currently available grating fabrication techniques, most significantly, it enables the patterning of sub-micron gratings on substrates having large sags.	13117

Development of Multi-chroic Millimeter-wave Polarization Sensitive Detector Arrays	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx measurements of the polarization of the xxxxxx (CMB) will improve our understanding of both cosmology and fundamental physics. Measurements of CMB lensing will provide tight constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses and dark energy. Observations of large angular scale polarization provide a unique opportunity to probe inflationary physics at the GUT energy scale through searches for the imprint of inflationary gravitational waves. Both of these measurements are limited by detector technology and would benefit from multi-frequency observations to remove foregrounds.This fellowship will support my efforts to develop multi-chroic polarization-sensitive detectors with the McMahon group at the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx. These new pixels will image the polarization of the CMB in multiple frequency bands simultaneously. This can be used to improve the sensitivity, spectral resolution, and spectral reach beyond what is achieved with the current generation of single frequency detectors. Therefore, multi-chroic detectors represent one of the most promising approaches for improving the cosmology possible with future experiments. This technology will be especially valuable for space missions where the cost of increased focal plane area is extremely high.The initial goal for this work is to develop a 90/150 GHz array and deploy it as part of the xxxxxxPol project. This multi-chroic array will image the polarization in the 90 GHz and 150 GHz bands, which offer the best signal to foreground ratio on the CMB and therefore the best raw sensitivity to lensing and inflationary B-modes. The improved sensitivity and frequency coverage will enhance measurements of lensing and polarization. We expect this will be the first use of multi-chroic detectors on a CMB experiment. xxxxxxults from this field test will be used to further improve these detectors and will raise the technical readiness of these detectors to xxxxxx 5. This work will yield both a short-term scientific results as well as a longer-term impact from the application of this technology to future experiments operating over a wide range of frequencies.During the second half of this fellowship I will incorporate the lessons learned in the field into improved detector designs and I will investigate scaling these detectors to the new frequency bands needed to characterize and remove CMB foregrounds. These detectors would enable a range of new polarization experiments.This work will involve significant collaboration with Dr. xxxxxx at xxxxxx xxxxxx and Dr. xxxxxx at xxxxxxs xxxxxx. xxxxxx with these groups, I will work on RF design, optical testing, and array design with a goal of producing sensitive multi-chroic detectors suitable for a wide variety of future experiments. This work addresses both technology development for the xxxxxxics of the Cosmos Program (PCOS) and technology development for the xxxxxx Program (COP) science areas by improving the sensitivity of millimeter-wavelength detectors and working towards improved dark energy detection capabilities.

Evaluation of Carbon Composite Overwrap Pressure Vessels Fabricated Using Ionic Liquid Epoxies	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	"In terms of \"xxxxxxovation\" this is a unique epoxy with unique properties, and xxxxxx co-holds the patent.  This epoxy is being exclusively formulated for cryogenic use. Utilizing storage tanks fabricated from fiber reinforced polymeric composites for storing cryogenic fluids such as liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen under pressure is of great interest to xxxxxx.  In particular, their high strength to weight ratio gives them a clear advantage over strictly aluminum alloy components; a 20-40% weight reduction can also be expected.  Unfortunately such composites, especially at cryogenic temperatures, develop stiffness that diminishes the desired toughness; this promotes delamination and crack growth which leads to leaking of the fuel component; this detriment is exacerbated if the component is cycled between room and cryogenic temperatures.   The work proposed here intends to eliminate that concern by utilizing a unique, and patented, ionic liquid (IL) epoxy.  Our novel, to date, results supporting that supposition include: · A viable means to synthesize high-quality ionic liquid epoxy monomer has been established. · xxxxxx-scale xxxxxx-Shell-Rubber (CSR) particles designed to toughen polymers have been successfully and uniformly incorporated into the epoxy matrix. · xxxxxx cycling of the epoxy between room (RT) and xxxxxx (LN2) temperatures, with and without CSR, does not appreciably affect the fracture energy at RT establishing that micro-cracking does not develop in the samples. · xxxxxx shows that adding CSR particles improve toughness and strength at RT and LN2 temperatures. · Measurements of the epoxy Coefficient of Thermal Expansion from cryogenic to room temperature is very favorable at 35 ppm which places it amongst the lowest of the common polymers. · CSR increased the glass transition temperature (0% CSR = 61.5°; 8.8% CSR = 95.5°C) allowing a higher working range. · xxxxxx-fiber test articles utilizing CSR containing epoxy have been made and show no cracking or delamination when repeatedly cycled in LN2. Relevant test results show improvements over commercial products at both room and LN2 temperatures.  Slight additions of CSR significantly increases the impact toughness which appears maximized near an 8.8% addition.  Considerable improvements were also noted here at both room and LN2 temperatures.  It was also noted that shocking the samples between room and LN2 temperatures, up to 10 times before testing, had no obvious effect in diminishing properties, i.e. no induced micro-cracking. xxxxxxier, it had been shown that a carbon fiber composite cylinder fabricated with the ionic liquid epoxy performed better at room and LN2 temperatures than the commercially used Hexcel®.  We have since successfully made some carbon fiber layups utilizing CSR containing epoxy for preliminary examination and testing.  Composite integrity was maintained on these layups with no separation, delamination, or cracking. Finally, ionic liquids have a number of additional advantages as a base for epoxy resins.  Their extremely low vapor pressures, good temperature stability, and low flammability further enhance their use for xxxxxx deep space, cryogenic, applications.  They have a comparatively \"greener\" manufacturing process than their counterparts.  Low permeability to hydrogen, and trivial moisture uptake after several days of submersion in salt water was also established.  The epoxy has also demonstrated strong binding to aluminum.  In short, ionic liquid based epoxies and composites are ideally suited to meet challenges associated with achieving xxxxxx space exploration goals.  "	13124
Cold Atom Gravity Gradiometer for Geodesy	2017-08-01	2018-07-19	We propose to design, build and test a high-performance, single-tensor-component gravity gradiometer applicable to Earth science studies on a satellite platform in low-Earth orbit. The instrument will take advantage of the long interrogation times that are available in microgravity environments. Our proposed design is based on light-pulse atom interferometry using cold atoms, and implements recent developments in atom cooling, interferometry and detection technologies. The sensor incorporates an intrinsic method of compensation for rotation-induced errors in the gravity gradient measurement.The gradiometer has a target gravity gradient noise floor of 7Ã—10 5 E/Hz1/2 when extrapolated to operation in a low-noise microgravity environment. This is an improvement over the noise performance of ESA's Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation xxxxxx (GOCE) gradiometers, whose short-term noise is approximately 3Ã—10 3 E/Hz1/2. In contrast to xxxxxx Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, the instrument will be capable of high-precision geodesy from a single satellite platform. In contrast to previous gradiometers based on atom interferometry, the proposed instrument achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity by exploiting the advantages of the microgravity environment.At the outset of the program, we will perform analysis and trade studies to determine sensor design parameters. At the same time, we will begin to conduct technology validation studies to reduce technical risk and select instrument components. We will create conceptual and detailed designs of the sensor that will lead directly into the sensor build effort. Following completed assembly of the instrument, we will conduct laboratory optimization and testing. The culmination of the program will be testing at the long interrogation times that will be achievable in a microgravity environment. The proposed performance period is three years. The initial xxxxxx will be 3, and through testing in the laboratory and in a simulated microgravity environment we will advance the xxxxxx to 5.	13125
Computational Modeling of Flow Control Systems for Aerospace Vehicles, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	Clear xxxxxx Corp. proposes to develop computational methods for designing active flow control systems on aerospace vehicles with the primary objective of controlling lift, drag, and flow separation.  Simulated control inputs will include moving boundaries for aerodynamic shaping and aspirating walls for virtual shaping and separation control.  The software will include model order reduction, system state estimation, integration of low-dimensional models and estimators with high-order CFD-based models for control-in-the-loop simulations, and the integration of turbulence models with control models.  CSC is developing reduced-order flow control models for laminar, incompressible flow based on a proper orthogonal decomposition of the primitive flow variables, and we will extend the methods to compressible formulations with conserved variables and turbulence models.  We will develop and demonstrate our computational methods using xxxxxx's CFD code, CFL3D.  Control models and estimators will be modular in the form of both embedded and pre-processing subroutines, enabling off-line and in-the-loop control design and testing. The project will include the application of modeling and estimation techniques to moving-mesh problems for control simulations with time-dependent system disturbances (e.g. changing angles of attack) and wing warping control input.   xxxxxx I work includes a demonstration of the technical merit of the tool and the development of a detailed xxxxxx work plan.	13126

Mars McLOX Rocket Propulsion System, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx and xxxxxxxxLOX rocket (MCLOX) is a technology for accomplishing ascent from xxxxxx. Current xxxxxx in-situ propellant production (ISPP) technologies produce methane and carbon monoxide in various combinations, but with neither generally produced in pure form. While separation and purification of methane fuel is possible, it adds complexity to the propellant production process and discards an otherwise useful fuel product. The MCLOX makes such complex and wasteful processes unnecessary by burning the methane/CO mixtures produced by xxxxxx ISPP systems without further refinement. Despite the decrease in rocket specific impulse caused by CO admixture, the improvement offered by concomitant increased propellant density provides a net improvement in stage performance, and this mission advantage is amplified further by the increase of the total amount of propellant produced and the decrease in mass and complexity of the required ISPP plant. For these reasons the development of the MCLOX rocket is important to achieve maximum benefit from xxxxxx ISPP systems.	13128
Magnetic Shape Memory Alloy Actuator for Instrument Applications	2015-09-01	2018-07-19	This project will develop a simple actuator based on magnetic shape memory alloy (MSMA), a novel new family of crystalline materials which exhibit strain deformation &gt;10% when subjected to a magnetic field. These materials have the unique property of retaining their strained state when the driving field is removed, making them unique in the world of shape memory materials, and desirable as an actuator material as they will maintain position when powered off. MSMA can potentially replace current shape memory alloys in many spaceflight instrument applications, as well as enable new precision mechanism types. The objective of this project is to develop a simple, small linear actuator system using magnetic shape memory allow capable of self-position sensing and power-off position maintenance. The actuator system will consist of a laboratory bench-top linear actuator, breadboard-level control electronics, and a computer command interface. The effort is a technology maturation of MSMA mechanisms, which are currently at xxxxxx 2/3, and we intend to bring them to xxxxxx 4. Boise State xxxxxxersity (BSU) is a research partner and will provide MSMA crystals and contribute design consultation.The innovative elements of this technology lie in the use of MSMA, which combine many very desirable properties lacking in other shape memory alloy materials. Similar to conventional SMAs, MSMA exhibit a large, reversible shape change related to a crystal structural transformation. Unlike conventional SMAs, which utilize temperature or voltage as the control parameter, MSMAs are driven by a magnetic field. xxxxxx can be applied with very short response times making MSMA-based actuators kHz capable. Furthermore, the magnetic-field-induced deformation is permanent, and reversible. Holding a constant position does not require power. Also, positioning is highly precise with accuracy in the nanometer range. These properties of MSMA-based actuators will increase the accuracy of earth and space science instruments and reduce operational power consumption.	13129

High Strength Structures by Carbon Nanotube Resonant Excitation	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	The objective of this project is to explore approaches to activate CNTs to draw in molecular species that induce bond formation to bridge the tubes. Besides having very attractive mechanical properties, CNTs also have excellent electrical and thermal properties. These properties lend themselves to coupling with energy sources so it is possible to precisely target site activation on the CNT surface to promote the introduction of molecular species that can form bonds between the tubes which enable load transfer between tubes. By this mechanism, short, discontinuous tubes can function as continuous load carrying members. The set of energetic sources that will be examined include microwaves, inductive heating, resistive heating, infrared, ultrasonic, electromechanical and resonant wavelength laser heating. xxxxxx for FY 16 will include survey of the methods listed above, focused on parameters required to couple with CNTs. Computational modeling will be used to guide the prioritization of experimental methods that yield the greatest promise in achieving the objective. of bridging CNT bundles.	13133

TDLAS Test-stand Diagnostics Development for Velocity, Temperature, Efficiency, and Erosion for Space Shuttle Main Engines, Phase I	2008-01-01	2018-07-19	We propose here to develop tunable diode laser spectroscopy as a diagnostic for xxxxxx main engines during test stand operations. These engines represent the state-of-the-art in rocket engine propulsion systems, and as such, they stretch available technology to the limit. The engines must be test-fired through several cycles prior to incorporation into the shuttle for flight operations. xxxxxx tests for the engines are extremely limited due to the harsh nature of the environment. We propose to develop diode laser instrumentation in order to measure temperature, velocity, surface erosion, and possibly efficiency in real time with an update rate of up to 1 kHz. The system technology will be based on wavelength multiplexed tunable diode laser spectroscopy which xxxxxx and Stanford have jointly developed to diagnose many types of aeropropulsion systems including SCRAMJETs, augmentors, and pulsed detonation engines. This project represents the first time that the wavelength-multiplexed technology will be tested on full-scale rocket engines.	13138

Titan Montgolfiere Terrestrial Test Bed, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	With the xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx Mission, xxxxxx is proposing to send a Montgolfiere balloon to probe the atmosphere of xxxxxx.  In order to better plan this mission and create a robust optimized balloon design, xxxxxx requires the ability to more accurately evaluate the convective heat transfer characteristics of the balloon operating in xxxxxx atmosphere.  xxxxxx on limitations and shortfalls of previous efforts, xxxxxx has requested proposals for a test bed to support CFD validation.  Near xxxxxx Corporation (NSC) proposes to develop an innovative xxxxxx Montgolfiere Terrestrial xxxxxx (TMTT) with an innovative integrated sensor and data collection system to provide the required validation.  The balloon envelope design will leverage experience gained on past xxxxxx prototypes, and incorporate a novel data acquisition system that will enable both direct and indirect measurements.  A combination of embedded sensors and infrared imaging will be used to provide both local and global surface measurements.  The embedded sensors will be used to calibrate the remote IR imaging, providing better visualizations with higher resolution and more accurate measurements.  The ground work for the system will be provided with model experimentation in xxxxxx I and followed by the development of a full-size test bed in xxxxxx.	13141
Membrane Water Recuperator, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	One of the xxxxxx reduction technologies currently being developed by xxxxxx is the xxxxxx and Moisture Removal Amine Swing-bed xxxxxx (CAMRAS). One of the disadvantages of the CAMRAS for long duration missions is that it removes moisture in addition to xxxxxx. One way to minimize the water loss from the atmosphere, yet still be able to implement the highly desirable xxxxxx removal function of the CAMRAS, is to implement a membrane water exchanger, or recuperator, at the inlet of the CAMRAS system. The water exchanger passes humidified, xxxxxx laden air on one side of a membrane. The water vapor passes through the membrane leaving the xxxxxx laden air to be treated by the amine system. The air returning from the amine system is dry and xxxxxx free, as its remaining moisture and xxxxxx have been absorbed by the amine beads. This dry air passes on the second side of the membrane. Its low dew point provides the driving force for the moisture that passes through from the inlet stream. The xxxxxx free air becomes re-humidified, thus conserving water in the overall system mass balance. The membrane is highly selective for water, and not for xxxxxx. The amount of carbon dioxide passing through the membrane and returning to the cabin is negligible; therefore the functionality of the CAMRAS as a xxxxxx removal system will not be impeded. The improvement over the current state-of-the-art is a reduction in power and the elimination of moving parts.	13142
ROC-Rib Deployable Ka-Band Antenna for Nanosatellites, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	"In these days of tight budgets and limited funding, xxxxxx is constantly looking for new ways to reduce development time and costs of future spacecraft. This is the driving spirit behind xxxxxx increasing interest in the CubeSat platform, and the vision that is guiding development and demonstration of higher-risk technologies that can eventually lead to low-cost atmospheric science from xxxxxx.  For example, a tantalizing next-generation CubeSat system would combine a high-gain deployable antenna with a high-frequency xxxxxx transponder to support very high bandwidth communications on the order of 10s of xxxxxx and/or very high-resolution radiometric remote sensing of atmospheric phenomenon.To address this need, xxxxxx proposes to develop a xxxxxx deployable mesh antenna that can package within a 2U-3U CubeSat volume and deploy to diameters of 0.8-1.5m.  The so-called \"xxxxxx-Rib\" antenna employs a backing structure that is a hybrid wrap-rib/perimeter-truss design.  A net supports a reflective mesh while the entire assembly provides the structural depth and surface accuracy needed for xxxxxx operation."	13143

Metrics for Evaluating Performance of Prognostic Techniques	2013-07-29	2018-07-19	Prognostics is an emerging concept in condition basedmaintenance(CBM)ofcriticalsystems.Alongwith developing the fundamentals of being able to confidently predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL), the technology calls for fielded applications as it inches towards maturation. This requires a stringent performance evaluation so that the significance of the concept can be fully exploited. Currently, prognostics concepts lack standard definitions and suffer from ambiguous and inconsistent interpretations. This lack of standards is in part due to the varied end-user requirements for different applications, time scales, available information, domain dynamics, etc. to name a few issues. Instead, the research community has used a variety of metrics based largely on convenience with respect to their respective requirements. Very little attention has been focused on establishing a common ground to compare different efforts. This paper surveys the metrics that are already used for prognostics in a variety of domains including medicine, nuclear, automotive, aerospace, and electronics. It also considers other domains that involve prediction-related tasks, such as weather and finance. Differences and similarities between these domains and health maintenancehave been analyzed to help understand what performance evaluation methods may or may not be borrowed. Further, these metrics have been categorized in several ways that may be useful in deciding upon a suitable subset for a specific application. Some important prognostic concepts have been defined using a notational framework that enables interpretation of different metrics coherently. Last, but not the least, a list of metrics has been suggested to assess critical aspects of RUL predictions before they are fielded in real applications.	13147

Physics-Based Pneumatic Hammer Instability Model, Phase I	2006-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx Turbine Technologies (FTT) proposes to conduct research necessary to develop a physics-based pneumatic hammer instability model for hydrostatic bearings operating in a compressible fluid.  The innovation of the resulting model is to account for the extreme density, compressibility, and non-uniform pressure variations found in highly turbulent rocket engine liquid hydrogen turbopump hydrostatic bearings as well as the variations resulting from 3-D effects such as tangential and/or axial injection, which are ignored in the pneumatic hammer instability criteria currently used throughout industry.  The ability to accurately predict the stability of highly turbulent, highly compressible liquid hydrogen hydrostatic bearings incorporating 3-D effects is essential for xxxxxx to achieve IHPRPT objectives through the use of smaller, faster turbopumps.  This project will enable the accurate prediction of bearing stability, resulting in higher performing bearings that enable smaller operating clearances for improved turbopump and system-level performance.	13149

Specific extensions include supporting preferred CAD tool (Siemens NX), FEA xxxxxxing (FEMAP), and IMUQ uncertainty quantification. In addition, the use of external, configuration-managed databases will be supported to track design parameter evolution.

Self-Healing Inflatable, Rigidizable Shelter for the Lunar Environment, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	Any manned missions to extraterrestrial locations will require shelter structures for a variety of purposes ranging from habitat usage to biomass production.  Such shelters need to be constructed in such a way to minimize stowed volume and payload weight.  The structures must also be very durable and have the ability to survive punctures without collapsing.  Ways of increasing available crew-load volume without greatly increasing launch weight or volume are also sought.Inflatable structures are ideal candidates for habitat structures for several reasons: (1) they feature the low stowage volume and payload weight required, (2) deployed volume can be easily increased without large increases in launch weight or volume, (3) they offer unique opportunities for incorporating intelligent and/or multifunctional systems such as self-healing capability, power generation and storage, sensor systems, and radiation protection.Adherent Technologies, xxxxxx. is proposing an inflatable, rigidizable shelter system based on our Rigidization on CommandTM (xxxxxx) technology.  The proposed shelter system would feature not only the required low stowage volume and lightweight character, but would also feature a self-healing foam system incorporated into the final structure to minimize the damage caused by any potential punctures to the structure.  Additional features will be incorporated in the xxxxxx follow-on, including thin film photovoltaics to provide power for the lighting system and later habitat function, sensor systems for monitoring both structural and crew health, and radiation protection systems.	13151
DATA MINING THE GALAXY ZOO MERGERS	2010-10-13	2018-07-19	DATA MINING THE GALAXY ZOO MERGERxxxxxxEVEN BAEHR*, ARUN VEDACHALAM*, KIRK BORNE*, AND DANIEL SPONSELLER*Abstract. Collisions between pairs of galaxies usually end in the coalescence (merger) of the twogalaxies. Collisions and mergers are rare phenomena, yet they may signal the ultimate fate ofmost galaxies, including our own Milky Way. With the onset of massive collection of astronomicaldata, a computerized and automated method will be necessary for identifying those collidinggalaxies worthy of more detailed study. This project researches methods to accomplish that goal.Astronomical data from the Sloan Digital xxxxxx Survey (SDSS) and human-provided classificationson merger status from xxxxxx project are combined and processed with machine learningalgorithms. The goal is to determine indicators of merger status based solely on discovering thoseautomated pipeline-generated attributes in the astronomical database that correlate most stronglywith the patterns identified through visual inspection by xxxxxx volunteers. In the end,we aim to provide a new and improved automated procedure for classification of collisions andmergers in future petascale astronomical sky surveys. Both information gain analysis (via thexxxxxx decision tree algorithm) and cluster analysis (via the xxxxxxes-Bouldin Index) are explored astechniques for finding the strongest correlations between human-identified patterns and existingdatabase attributes. xxxxxx attributes measured in the SDSS green waveband images are found torepresent the most influential of the attributes for correct classification of collisions and mergers.Only a nominal information gain is noted in this research, however, there is a clear indication ofwhich attributes contribute so that a direction for further study is apparent.	13152

The power modules incorporate several radical new advances in power design including ceramic cores and quasi-linear circuitry.  The program will exit with such modules having been verified for thermal vacuum and electromagnetic (susceptibility and radiation) performance of modules that can tolerate >0.3Mrad and >200C operation with negligible electromagnetic coupling and extremely high electrical isolation.	13153
Advanced Radiometer For Cloud Liquid Water and Aircraft Icing Detection, Phase II	2007-11-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx icing continues to be one of the major safety and operational concerns of the FAA, elements of the military, and the foreign military and civilian counterparts. xxxxxxs to develop methods to directly detect aircraft icing meteorological conditions have met with mixed success. Combining ground-based microwave radiometers with radars has shown great promise, but deficiencies of the radiometers have limited their value. In our xxxxxx I effort we have determined solutions to several technical challenges in the design of a narrow beam multi-waveband radiometer that is to operate in concert with weather radars. We have also calculated optimum eigenfrequencies for detection of aircraft icing conditions. In xxxxxx we will construct a turnkey fast sampling multifrequency profiling and dual polarization narrow beam radiometer system. In this radiometer system, all beams are collinear and match the antenna gain pattern of weather research radars. The radiometer will have the capability of profiling (ranging) water vapor along the beam as well as discriminate ice and water phase hydrometeors. We will also develop a fast beam steering system to operate in concert with the radar. The turnkey radiometer system and documentation are deliverables.	13154
Integrated Medical Model – Chest Injury Model	2012-02-01	2018-07-19	The Exploration Medical xxxxxxability (xxxxxx) Element of xxxxxx Human xxxxxxearch Program (HRP) developed the xxxxxxted Medical xxxxxx (IMM) to forecast the resources necessary to adequately treat an ill or injured crew member during xxxxxx and exploration missions. The IMM project addresses the HRP Risk of the “Inability to Adequately Recognize or Treat an Ill or Injured xxxxxxmember.” The HRP Gap associated with this risk is the “xxxxxx of knowledge about incidence rates, probabilities and consequences relative to xxxxxx and/or xxxxxx of Mission (LOC/LOM) for the medical conditions on the Exploration Medical Condition List.” The medical condition being examined in this project is traumatic injury to the chest. The probability of occurrence was unknown and it needed to be quantified. This study is significant because should a traumatic chest injury occur during a spaceflight, the impact of occurrence is severe, including the potential for LOC/LOM. This study is important because it quantified the probability of a traumatic chest injury occurring during a space mission and the quantification will help to close the risk of being unable to treat an injured crewmember because of inadequate preparation.    The chest injury probability calculation was broken down into four steps: 1) Definition of initiating events, impactor masses, and astronaut characteristics; 2) Calculation of an impact response using a biomechanical model of the thorax; 3) Definition of a relationship between the impact response and severity of injury and transformation of the relationship to a probability; 4) Definition of the rate of impact and transformation of the rate to a probability. A probabilistic modeling approach was taken to calculate the injury probability, so that the uncertainty in the prediction could be captured. xxxxxxs of parameter values were used instead of single deterministic values to capture population and other types of variability. xxxxxx simulations were performed rather than a single calculation, in order to predict the probability in terms of the most likely probability, the standard deviation, and a confidence interval. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was performed in order to determine the parameters that contributed the most to the uncertainty of the prediction.    The quantification of the probability of traumatic chest injury begins by defining the initiating event. For this medical event, the initiating event is an impact to the chest, which could occur accidentally as the astronauts move about and work on the xxxxxx. xxxxxxs move about the xxxxxx by pushing-off of the walls or fixed equipment and translating through the station. Their work often requires them to move equipment from one part of the station to another. Impact to the chest could occur accidentally while the attention of the astronaut is focused on something other than where they are translating and the equipment in their surroundings. An example scenario of how the initiating event (the impact) could occur is one astronaut translating with equipment too large to see around and another astronaut accidentally being impacted in the chest with the equipment, while translating with his attention focused elsewhere. The mass and velocity of the astronauts and xxxxxx equipment are important parameters that were quantified in order to calculate whether or not the impact described in the above scenario results in an injury. xxxxxx for astronaut mass and translational velocity and of xxxxxx equipment masses were obtained from xxxxxx xxxxxxs and other xxxxxx documents.     During an impact to the chest there is a transfer of energy from the impactor to the chest of the astronaut. The energy associated with the impact is dependent on the mass and velocity of the impactor. The energy absorbed by the chest, and any damage that occurs, is dependent on the amount of energy needed to bring the impactor to rest. A massive impactor with a high velocity will contain a high amount of energy that will need to be absorbed by the chest to bring it to rest. If the structural tissues of the chest cannot withstand the absorbed energy, they will be damaged, resulting in injury. A small mass with a low velocity will have a low amount of energy associated with it and the chest may be able to withstand that amount of energy without damage. The purpose of the biomechanical model was to calculate this energy transfer and the resulting change in the structure of the chest, manifested as a change in chest depth, as the chest is compressed during the impact. The impact responses were calculated with a lumped-mass-spring-damper, biomechanical model of the human thorax with an impacting mass and elastic interface. Impact force and the normalized chest compression were the impact responses calculated.     A relationship between the impact response and the severity of a resulting injury was developed. Normalized compression (NC), calculated from the biomechanical model was the impact response value used, and it was linearly related to the thorax Abbreviated Injury Score. The thorax Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) is a scale of injury type and severity for thoracic skeletal and soft tissue injuries that has been developed for clinical use as a method of categorizing injury severity. Traumatic chest injury for this module was defined as an injury that results in an AIS score of 3 or higher. A transformation function was used to transform the NC vs. AIS relationship to a probability that the initiating event (impact to the chest) results in a NC that causes an injury with an AIS score of 3 or higher.     The final step in the calculation of the probability of traumatic chest injury during an xxxxxx mission was a quantification of the probability of opportunity for a forceful impact to occur to the chest within an astronaut’s normal daily activities. The rate of occurrence of the accident described in the above scenario is needed to calculate the probability of occurrence. The rate represents the number of times during a mission that an astronaut accidentally impacts a piece of equipment. The estimated rate is transformed into a probability of opportunity to sustain an impact to the chest. The rate of impact used in this module was based on historical spaceflight data and a xxxxxx’s equation was used to find the probability of the occurrence of an impact.    The above components were integrated together so that the probability of chest injury during an xxxxxx mission could be determined. A profile of impactor masses and velocities was used as input to the biomechanical model. The normalized compression of the chest due to the impact was the output of the biomechanical model. The probability of injury due to the chest compression was determined from the relationship between normalized compression and AIS score data from cadaver experiments. A historical impact rate was used to determine the probability of occurrence of impact with equipment. The product of the probability of occurrence and the probability of injury was used to determine the overall probability of a traumatic chest injury during one year on xxxxxx. A xxxxxx approach was used in which 100,000 simulations of the impact scenario were performed, each using a different combination of model parameters.     The probability of traumatic chest injury during one year on xxxxxx was determined to be: 5.32 x 10-4 ± 5.95 x 10-4 (4.16 x 10-5 – 1.39 x 10-3), presented as the most likely probability ± the standard deviation (90th percentile confidence interval). In addition to the probability estimate, a sensitivity analysis and a verification and validation analysis of the biomechanical model of the thorax were performed. The most sensitive parameters of the model are, in order of sensitivity: 1) velocity of the impactor; 2) rate of occurrence of an impact; 3) The intercept coefficient in the probability of injury equation; 4) mass of the impactor. The output of our biomechanical thorax model matches the output obtained by the original authors of the biomechanical thorax model, which verifies that the biomechanical thorax model was implemented correctly.

Monolithic, High-Speed Fiber-Optic Switching Array for Lidar, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	The proposed optical device is a fiber-based multi-channel switch to quickly switch a fiber-coupled laser among many possible output channels to create a fiber-based fixed-array laser transmitter for next-generation xxxxxx lidar systems.  The key innovation is the use of an arrangement of electro-optic prisms created in a nonlinear optical crystal through domain reversal to direct the laser into one of many possible output fibers.  This design will provide several important features that are required, yet not currently available in a fiber switch, in order to achieve a fiber-arrayed lidar source, such as high optical power handling, reduced crosstalk, low optical loss, fast switching times, low power consumption, and robust construction in a monolithic package with no moving parts.

Development of InAlAs Top Cell for High Specific Power Multijunction Photovoltaics	2019-08-01	2018-07-19	The semiconductor material InAlAs has the potential to improve upon current space photovoltaics in a number of ways. InAlAsSb lattice-matched to InP would operate as the top cell in a triple-junction design with an xxxxxx efficiency of 37.1%, a cell-level mass specific power >1000 W/kg, and panel-level mass specific power of 662 W/kg. xxxxxxment of InAlAs for engineered substrates would result in a lattice-matched triple-junction cell with a 1-sun AM1.5 efficiency of 40.4%. Additionally, InAlAs lattice-matched to InP has the appropriate bandgap for operation in low-intensity low-temperature conditions. xxxxxxment of these proposed photovoltaic cells is particularly warranted since the InP materials system is known to be exceptionally radiation tolerant, which is ideal for space operation. Furthermore, lattice-matched cells are lighter and more mechanically stable than their metamorphic counterparts. The technology proposed in this application would increase capability and durability for missions needing onboard power or electric propulsion, and would also correspond to technology gains for terrestrial concentrator photovoltaic systems.The materials proposed in this study have undergone little to no development. xxxxxxment of these materials would occur via semiconductor growth methods of metal organic vapor phase epitaxy or molecular beam epitaxy. Growth conditions such as temperature, gaseous precursors, and gas ratios can be adjusted to target desired material properties. This research would initially focus on materials development. Once the desired material are grown, they can then be fabricated in complete photovoltaic cells and tested for radiation and temperature tolerance which are important considerations for space applications.	13162
MeshSLAM: Robust Localization and Large-Scale Mapping in Barren Terrain, Phase II	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	Robots need to know their location to map of their surroundings but without global positioning data they need a map to identify their surroundings and estimate their location. Simultaneous localization and mapping (xxxxxx) solves these dual problems at once. xxxxxx does not depend on any kind of infrastructure and is thus a promising localization technology for xxxxxx planetary missions and for many terrestrial applications as well. xxxxxxver, state-of-the-art xxxxxx depends on easily-recognizable landmarks in the robot's environment, which are lacking in barren planetary surfaces. Our work will develop a technology we call xxxxxxxxxxxx, which constructs robust landmarks from associations of weak features extracted from terrain. Our test results will also show that xxxxxxxxxxxx applies to all environments in which xxxxxx rovers could someday operate: dunes, rocky plains, overhangs, cliff faces, and underground structures such as lava tubes. Another limitation of xxxxxx for planetary missions is its significant data-association problems. As a robot travels it must infer its motion from the sensor data it collects, which invariably suffers from drift due to random error. To correct drift, xxxxxx recognize when the robot has returned to a previously-visited place, which requires searching over a great deal of previously-sensed data. Computation on such a large amount of memory may be infeasible on space-relevant hardware. xxxxxxxxxxxx eases these requirements. It employs topology-based map segmentation, which limits the scope of a search. Furthermore, a faster, multi-resolution search is performed over the topological graph of observations. xxxxxx xxxxxx LLC and Carnegie Mellon xxxxxxersity have formed a partnership to commercially develop xxxxxxxxxxxx. xxxxxxxxxxxx technology will be available via open source, to ease its adoption by xxxxxx. In xxxxxx of our project we will show the feasibility of xxxxxxxxxxxx for xxxxxx and commercial applications through a series of focused technical demonstrations.	13163
Intelligent Media Access Protocol for SDR-Based Satellite Communications	2019-08-01	2018-07-19	In a communications channel, the space environment between a spacecraft and an Earth ground station can potentially cause the loss of a data link or at least degrade its performance. The research plan detailed in this proposal describes an adaptive, intelligent MAC protocol for software-defined radio space-communications applications. It consists of sensing, predictive, and decision mechanisms that will drive an overall framework to sense current channel conditions, predict the near-future channel conditions, and then automatically reconfigure based on these inputs. The reconfiguration of the SDR will be based on attempting to maintain the performance requirements for the data link, such as bit error rate, up-time, reliability, and/or data rate. Upon successful testing onboard xxxxxx using the xxxxxx Communications and Navigation (xxxxxx) xxxxxx, this research effort will change the xxxxxx level from xxxxxx 3 to xxxxxx 5 in the area of xxxxxx.

The subsequent effects of poor image quality range from inconvenient to dangerous depending on the application.  In xxxxxx I, EM Photonics developed a prototype solver based on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology capable of enhancing long-range images and videos by compensating for atmosphere induced distortions.  This solver was built on an FPGA-platform and thus offered a significant performance increase over traditional, software-based approaches.  In xxxxxx, we will extend this prototype to process incoming video streams in real-time for a variety of formats, including the high-definition version used by xxxxxx.  The resulting device will be light-weight and low-power and can be integrated with current video collection, viewing, and recording equipment.  This device can be used to process data as it is collected (in real-time) or from previously recorded imagery and deployed with camera systems or in data centers depending on the application.  Additionally, since this processing unit is built on FPGA technology, it can easily be extended to perform a variety of other tasks such as compression, encryption or further processing.	13165

During xxxxxx I, xxxxxxovative xxxxxx xxxxxx Company (ITAC), LLC and researchers from UND developed and demonstrated drag reduction of more than 65% in turbulent boundary layers using the SLIPPS approach. This approach intervenes in the Streak Transient Growth Instability mechanism which is a dominant mechanism in the production of drag in turbulent boundary layer flows. In xxxxxx, we will investigate and test the use of SLIPPS concept at both higher xxxxxx number and xxxxxx number flows, as well as build an improved understanding of the physics in order to make even further efficiency gains possible. xxxxxx will advance the xxxxxx to a level suitable for flight tests and integration into production systems.	13166

Activity modeling under uncertainty by trace of objects in smart homes	2012-09-06	2018-07-19	A typical resident of a smart home can be an Alzheimer patient that forgets sometimes to complete the activities that he begins. The key point to assist the smart home resident is to model the activities and discover correct realization patterns of activities. To accomplish this task, we apply sensors to provide primary data about realization patterns of actions, operations, plans, goals and generally any objective that the smart home resident may desire to do. In the consequence, by applying fuzzy clustering techniques, we are able to mine sensor data to retrieve the realization patterns of activities, and so the prediction patterns of intentions are recognizable. Comparing the realization patterns with prediction patterns of activities, we would be able to predict the intention of the resident about the activity that the resident considers to realize. In this way, we would be able to provide hypotheses about the resident goals and his possible goal achievement’s defects. Spatiotemporal aspects of daily activities such as movement of objects are surveyed to discover the patterns of activities realized by the smart homes residents. In this research, uncertainty is considered as a property of activity recognition.	13172
Thin Flexible IMM Solar Array, Phase II	2014-05-01	2018-07-19	Thin, flexible, and highly efficient solar arrays are needed that package compactly for launch and deploy into large, structurally stable high power generators.  Inverted Metamorphic xxxxxx-junction (IMM) solar cells can enable these arrays, offering higher efficiencies of >33% and lower mass and flexibility, but integration challenges of this thin crystalline cell technology need solution.  The Thin Hybrid Interconnected xxxxxxar-Array (THINS) technology allows robust and reliable integration of IMM cells into a flexible blanket comprising standardized modules engineered for producibility.  The modules support the IMM cell by using multi-functional materials for structural stability, shielding, CTE stress relief, and integrated thermal and electrical functions. The xxxxxx I effort demonstrated the feasibility of key THINS component, including the structurally stabilized IMM cell, and integration with advanced multi-functional substrate and superstrate components, and completed the modularity approach for interfacing into the Roll Out xxxxxxar Array (ROSA) deployable structure, while improving standardization and manufacturability. Design evaluation shows figures of merit for array level specific power, including deployable structure, greater than 400W/kg and volumetric efficiency greater than15kW/m^3, significantly higher than current approaches. The low mass and low stowed volume provides a path to package 300kW in a single launch with a deployment approach that uses simple, robust mechanisms.  xxxxxx advances the THINS/ROSA technology, incorporating advanced  4 -xxxxxxction IMM solar cells into THINS modules using demonstrated spaceflight qualified materials, testing module coupons in thermal cycling and plasma environments, fabricating a full-scale module to demonstrate automatable manufacturing processes, integrating that module and inactive modules (with cell simulators) into the ROSA deployable structure, and culminating in a full-scale deployment demonstration.	13173

While several different LIDAR ranging techniques are currently employed for airborne detection applications, the RL Associates xxxxxx. hazard detection and mitigation system is based upon our patented range-gated technique used in our Firexxxxxx system.  This technique allows not only detection of obscurants, but can also be used to image through obscurants and thus mitigate the hazard.

These investigations are critical to advancing our understanding of many astrophysical problems related to investigating the structure and evolution of the universe and the origins of the elements, all fundamental xxxxxx goals. Transition Edge xxxxxx microcalorimeters and bolometers have been highly successful in ground and balloon-based experiments, and technology development is underway to take the next step and operate a TES array in space. Transition Edge xxxxxxs are a versatile and still-developing technology, with applications ranging from astrophysical investigations like the cosmic microwave background and X-ray spectroscopy to potential industrial applications like compact, high resolution X-ray microanalysis instruments. The goal of my investigation is to develop transition edge sensor technology that can be used for a new space-based application, the study of the diffuse soft x-ray background.Diffuse background studies make stringent demands on many different aspects of detector design. Therefore, the new TES technology developed in such an investigation can benefit a variety of applications. With this in mind, my research plan includes learning about space hardware and instrumentation by preparing for a sounding rocket flight that will obtain a high resolution spectrum of the soft X-ray background with a thermistor microcalorimeter array. This will help me build a solid background in instrument science, which I will apply to overcoming the technical challenges associated with building a large-area high energy resolution array of transition edge sensors needed to study the diffuse background.	13177

Towards Requirements in Systems Engineering for Aerospace IVHM Design	2013-12-12	2018-07-19	Health management (HM) technologies have been employed for safety critical system for decades, but a coherent systematic process to integrate HM into the system design is not yet clear. Consequently, in most cases, health management resorts to be an after-thought or ‘band-aid’ solution. Moreover, limited guidance exists for carrying out systems engineering (SE) on the subject of writing requirements for designs with integrated vehicle health management (IVHM). It is well accepted that requirements are key to developing a successful IVHM system right from the concept stage to development, verification, utilization, and support. xxxxxxver, writing requirements for systems with IVHM capability have unique challenges that require the designers to look beyond their own domains and consider the constraints and specifications of other interlinked systems. In this paper we look at various stages in the SE process and identify activities specific to IVHM design and development. More importantly, several relevant questions are posed that system engineers must address at various design and development stages. Addressing these questions should provide some guidance to systems engineers towards writing IVHM related requirements to ensure that appropriate IVHM functions are built into the system design	13186

Time and fuel-optimal maneuvers are only a part of the optimization problem.  Selecting the maneuver waypoints (number and location) determines the quality of the synthesized image.  The number of S/C, the size of the sub-apertures, and the type of propulsion system used also impacts imaging rate, propellant mass, and mission cost.  xxxxxxturing all of these mission aspects in an integrated mission optimization framework helps mission designers to select the most appropriate architecture for meeting the needs and constraints of missions such as SI.	13187

In this paperwe introduce a framework, called DXF, thatprovides a common language to represent the systemdescription, sensor data and the fault diagnosisresults; a run-time architecture to executethe diagnosis algorithms under identical conditionsand collect the diagnosis results; and an evaluationcomponent that can compute performancemetrics from the diagnosis results to compare thealgorithms. We have used DXF to perform an empiricalevaluation of 13 diagnostic algorithms on ahardware testbed (ADAPT) at xxxxxx xxxxxx and on a set of synthetic circuitstypically used as benchmarks in the model-baseddiagnosis community. xxxxxx on these empiricaldata we analyze the performance of each algorithmand suggest directions for future development.	13188

Robust Voice Communication Understanding for Single-Pilot Operations, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	Motivated by the anticipation of pilot shortage in the future and the quest of cost reduction in airline operations, the single-pilot operation (SPO) concept emerges as a promising alternative of the current-day multi-pilot operations. This proposal addresses the feasibility of constructing a spoken language understanding system for decoding voice communications in Air Traffic Control. In particular, we address the issue of developing a voice communication understanding system (VCUS) that would serve as one key component in both cockpit automation and ground-based automation for supporting the SPO concept. Leveraged from our prior development on noise-robust speech recognition system for the Navy and virtual agents for xxxxxx to support human-in-the-loop simulations, an infrastructure of VCUS in Air Traffic Control of commercial flights will be developed. A feasibility demonstration of the VCUS that extracts out semantic information for persistent display of clearance message within the flight deck will be provided by the end of the xxxxxx I research. xxxxxx work will utilize the infrastructure built in xxxxxx I to expand the VCUS to a full-scale prototype that supports cockpit automation and ground-based automation for SPO.	13192

The proposed ROM-ROM methodology tightly couples a nonlinear-FEM based structural ROM with CFD based neural-net aerodynamic ROM to achieve a high computational efficiency.  Indeed, the computing time for a typical wing flutter/LCO analysis is reduced from hours (direct) to minutes (ROM-ROM).  The structural ROM enables a seamless time-integration of the ROM-ROM and could be coupled with other aerodynamic ROM methods like xxxxxx or POD.  A time-accurate GasKinetic BGK method (BGKX) is adopted to generate the aerodynamic ROM for rarefied hypersonic unsteady aerodynamics/aeroelasticity applications to a ballute in atmospheric entry.  With a natural boundary condition, BGKX is superior to continuum methods for unsteady flow simulations, and unified in transition to continuum flow regimes covering the peak dynamic pressure range in Earth/xxxxxx entries.  It can provide flow pressures and heat flux in one step.  In xxxxxx I, we will consider both a 2D membrane-on-wedge system and a modeled ballute system and investigate their static aeroelasticity as well as the feasibility/efficiency of the ROM-ROM approach for their dynamic aeroelastic responses (flutter/LCO).  These capabilities are necessary for the development of inflatable aeroelasticity in xxxxxx space program.	13193
Lunar Health Monitor, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx xxxxxxearch has successfully demonstrated a dry electrode (no electrolyte or gel required) for heart rate and ECG monitoring.  Preliminary data has indicated that the electrode can be incorporated into a garment that does not require an adhesive for successful data collection.  Further preliminary data indicates that respiration rate can be deduced from the ECG waveform captured from the dry electrodes. The xxxxxx xxxxxx Health Monitor (LHM) will incorporate the patented dry electrode with other commercially available sensors in a garment resulting in fully wearable monitor of xxxxxx Health.  The data from each of the sensor is processed, yielding a comprehensive image of overall health. Environment sensors are also incorporated to detect longer term health threats.  The LHM is comfortable and non-inhibiting. The xxxxxx xxxxxx Health Monitor is intended to enable continuous monitoring of health status of xxxxxxs both in  intra- and extra-vehicular sorties.	13194
Intelligent Information Processing for Enhanced Safety in the NAS, Phase II	2019-04-01	2018-07-19	Our xxxxxx I work focused on how improved information flow between actors in a flight deck environment can improve safety performance. An operational prototype was developed demonstrating how the Intelligent Information xxxxxx xxxxxx (IIPS) will operate in actual accidents/incidents.For xxxxxx, we propose the following operating environment extensions from the flight deck environment: xxxxxx scenarios emphasizing interactions with air traffic controllers operating in fast paced, increased volume of manned and autonomous traffic; UAV operations emphasizing introduction of UAVs into the NAS, transition to autonomy and fully autonomous operations; and IIPS in flight training environments both simulated and airborne.  We also propose an extension to the manner in which conditions were developed in xxxxxx  Conditions were developed using post analysis of accidents and incidents.  The error chain of events was identified, information necessary to prevent the event was identified, and finally, a condition developed that detected the circumstances for a possible safety failure so that a notification could be transmitted to the actor who would then take the appropriate action to break the error chain.  This paradigm of condition development can be characterized as reactive.  With the NAS moving into a state of flux with the integration of UAVs and general increased traffic volume, reactive safety may not be acceptable.  In order to continue the steadily improving safety record of aviation, a more proactive approach must be considered.  We propose the use of a classical rule-based expert system and other artificial intelligence approaches that can make inferences of possible unsafe conditions using a temporal knowledge base populated by propositional statements generated by IIPS information sources.	13195
A CubeSat-Scale Testbed for Cryogenic Fluid Management Technologies, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx has identified in-space cryogenic fluid management (CFM) as a high priority for technology development because the construction of an in-space propellant infrastructure is anticipated to dramatically decrease costs across a broad spectrum of missions.  This importance is reflected in the designation of CFM as a xxxxxx xxxxxx Demonstration Mission (FTD-2) as well as a mission at the level of Crosscutting Technologies (CRYOTE).  xxxxxx proposes to develop a CFM testbed at the scale of an xxxxxx Demonstration Mission (xxxxxxCube) that would serve as a platform for a series of flight tests of many major CFM technologies.  The missions will be designed to be conducted as stand-alone satellites, without reliance on propellant transfer from an upper stage, in order to provide the greatest possible flexibility for launch vehicle selection.  Follow-up missions using dedicated small satellite launch vehicles could take advantage of the technology demonstrated during this xxxxxx program, and could be performed as funding becomes available instead of depending on the allocation in a large block.	13196
A direct probe of dark energy interactions with a solar System laboratory	2018-01-01	2018-07-19	We propose a mission concept for direct detection of dark energy interactions with normal matter in a xxxxxxar xxxxxx laboratory. Dark energy is the leading proposal to answer the question of the accelerated expansion of the xxxxxx. This interaction must be highly suppressed to be consistent with the gravity measurements and observations we have so far, but can be probed with specifically designed experiments. By flying unscreened atomic particles through special gravitational field regions in the xxxxxxar xxxxxx and conducting double differential measurements to isolate possible dark energy interaction with the atoms, we will stand a chance to achieve a direction detection of dark energy, akin to direct detection of dark matter and gravitational waves. This could lead to a fundamental shift in our understanding of fundamental physics and our universe, stimulating a wide variety of foundational research in cosmology and particle physics.	13197
Embedding Procedure Assistance into Mission Control Tools, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxedures are the accepted means of commanding spacecraft. xxxxxxeduresencode the operational knowledge of a system as derived from systemexperts, testing, training and experience.  xxxxxx has tens of thousandsof procedures for xxxxxx and xxxxxx,which are used daily by both flight controllers and crew.  It isexpected that the new Constellation vehicles, including xxxxxxn, xxxxxx habitats, will have thousands of procedures to ensure safeoperation.  Currently procedures are executed manually using standardcommand and control displays.  We are proposing a new paradigm wherebyprocedures interact closely with the next generation telemetry andcommand displays being developed for xxxxxx and with a procedureassistant that can automatically dispatch commands and evaluatetelemetry under tight supervision of the operator. The procedureassistant will consist of an interactive procedure display, aprocedure assistant executive, a set of procedure support services andan editor for modifying existing procedures or building simple newprocedures.  In our paradigm rocedures will be just like any othercomponent of an integrated suite of mission control tools. This willgreatly enhance the efficiency of flight controllers and reducetraining costs associated with having a separate set of tools forprocedures.	13198

PowerCube: Integrated Power, Propulsion, and Pointing for CubeSats, Phase II	2014-04-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxxCube is a 1U CubeSat module that provides integrated propulsion, power, and precision pointing to enable the low-cost CubeSat platform to be used to conduct high-performance missions. The xxxxxxCube concept integrates three innovative component technologies to provide these capabilities:  First, a xxxxxx Exchange xxxxxx (PEM) water-electrolysis fuel cell supplies gH2/gO2 to a simple pressure-fed thruster to provide 300 Ns of impulse per 100 mL of water. This approach enables the CubeSat to launch with 'inert' propellant to comply with P-POD limitations on stored energy and then process the water on-orbit into high-xxxxxx fuel. xxxxxxond, a deployable solar array that stows along the long sides of the CubeSat and deploys in a 'windmill' configuration provides up to 96 W peak. Third, a 3DOF 'carpal-wrist' gimbal, in conjunction with magnetic torque coils, enables sun-tracking of the solar panel, vectoring of the thruster, and precision pointing of payloads. The combination of ample power and water electrolysis will provide up to 6 m/s of delta-V per 90 minute orbit for a 3U CubeSat. Compared to other CubeSat propulsion technologies, the xxxxxxCube thruster will enable more rapid orbital maneuvering and significantly lower contamination issues.  Our xxxxxx I effort developed a detailed baseline design for the xxxxxxCube, and built and tested a proof-of-concept prototype of the water-electrolysis thruster.  xxxxxx effort will mature the electrolysis thruster component to the engineering model level, develop and simulate methods for attitude control and precise pointing of both panels and payloads using the gimbal and torque coils, and develop a detailed design for the entire xxxxxxCube module to enable flight validation in follow-on xxxxxx efforts.	13202

Novel Methods for the Flexible Ultrasound System utilizing Augmented Reality Just-In-Time Procedural Guidance, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx future manned spaceflight missions will require medical diagnosis and treatment capabilities that address both the anticipated health risks and perform well in austere, remote operational environments. xxxxxxflight- ready medical devices will need to be capable of an increased degree of autonomous operation, acquiring clinically relevant and diagnosable data by every astronaut, not just select physician crew members credentialed in spaceflight medicine. xxxxxxsound is a diagnostic and treatment technology that currently fulfills mission medical capability support on xxxxxx and is planned to accompany future deep-space missions. The Flexible xxxxxxsound xxxxxx (FUS) is a new platform that is currently being developed by xxxxxx and research partners to support this mission role.

Advanced Microwave Electrothermal Thruster (AMET), Phase I	2010-01-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx Technologies Corporation (ORBITEC) and the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx at xxxxxx (UAH) propose to develop the xxxxxx xxxxxxthermal xxxxxx (AMET), a high-efficiency thruster which will use water propellant to enable various xxxxxx and xxxxxx missions.  The proposed AMET will incorporate a number of innovations to dramatically improve upon existing designs, including the use of a lower microwave frequency (915 MHz) to permit the achievement of very high microwave generation efficiency with commercially-available magnetrons.  The AMET is a particularly attractive option for this class of missions because it provides specific impulse (~800 seconds) well beyond the reach of chemical propulsion, it provides high thrust per unit power to keep transit times acceptably short, and it permits the use of an easily-storable propellant (water) which is known to be available on both the xxxxxx and xxxxxx.  ORBITEC staff has experience operating microwave electrothermal thrusters with water vapor as propellant.  In xxxxxx I, the AMET will be demonstrated with water vapor propellant to demonstrate feasibility, reaching xxxxxx 4.  In xxxxxx, a flight-like AMET will be developed and demonstrated and a design will be prepared for an entire AMET flight propulsion system, reaching xxxxxx 6.	13206

Laser Additive Manufacturing of Large Scale Polymer Matrix Composite Structures, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	A laser heating system (LHS) for the automated fiber placement (AFP) of thermoplastic composites (TPC) has recently been developed by Automated Dynamics to technology readiness level (xxxxxx) three. This system represents the state of the art in out of autoclave, additive manufacturing of advanced polymer matrix composite (xxxxxx) structures. It is particularly suited for manufacture of large scale structures as there is no oven or autoclave requirement while being compatible with a wide variety of thermoplastic polymers.

Fine Water Mist Fire Extinguisher for Spacecraft, Phase II	2008-12-01	2018-07-19	This three phase xxxxxx project from ADA Technologies xxxxxx. (ADA) builds upon the experience of ADA in development of fine water mist (FWM) fire suppression technology.  ADA has subcontracted xxxxxx School of Mines (CSM) to provide expertise in fire scenarios in xxxxxx spacecraft; Spraying xxxxxxs for their expertise nozzle development, optimization, testing, and commercial manufacturing; and Pacific xxxxxxentific HTL Kin-Tech Division as a commercialization partner with expertise in flight qualified hardware.  This team will work to develop the FWM fire extinguisher which was proven to extinguish fires in phase I.FWM is a proven fire suppression technology with the ability to extinguish large fuel fed fires, as well as, small electrical fires. Unlike sprinkler water systems it does not damage structures, and unlike xxxxxx or xxxxxxn fire extinguishers it has only inert chemicals water and nitrogen, so it is not a health hazard, environmental hazard and easily scrubbed from the air with dehumidifiers when used in spacecraft. This new extinguisher's innovative design has the capability to discharge in any orientation, and has been dubbed the xxxxxxersal Discharge Orientation xxxxxx (UDOS). During xxxxxx I the UDOS system was capable of extinguishing fires in both normal vertical positions as well as upside down.  During the xxxxxx efforts the system will be evaluated to extinguish fires in any 360 degree orientation. The ultimate objective of this project is to develop a FWM fire extinguisher which can be commercially manufactured and is capable of extinguishing both large open fires and enclosed electrical fires with minimal water usage.	13210

Context-Augmented Robotic Interaction Layer (CARIL), Phase II	2017-06-01	2018-07-19	CHI xxxxxxs and the Institute for Human xxxxxx Cognition have teamed to create a human-robot interaction system that leverages cognitive representations of shared context as a basis for a fundamentally new approach to human-robotic interaction. This approach centers on a framework for representing context, and for using context to enable robot adaptive decision-making and behavior. The framework is called CARIL (the Context-Augmented Robotic Interaction xxxxxx).  Context is an important part of human-human interaction.  Unfortunately, context is often overlooked when designing robotic systems.  The challenge is to translate high-level concepts, such as teamwork and collaboration, into specific requirements that can be implemented within control algorithms, interface elements, and behaviors.  During xxxxxx I, CHI xxxxxxs developed a proof-of-concept CARIL implementation and applied it to a notional simulated robot in a simple station model.  This simulation demonstrated CARIL's feasibility by demonstrating how it gave the simulated robot a capability to reason about its context to avoid spatial interference with astronaut activities and tasks.	13212
Miniaturized Time Domain Terahertz Non Destructive Evaluation for In-Orbit Inspection of Inflatable Habitats and Thermal Protection Systems, Phase I	2011-09-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx's time-domain terahertz (TD-THz) non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technology could be usedto inspect space flight structures such as inflatable space habitats, thermal protection systems (TUFI-typetiles, SOFI TPS), for voids, disbonds, and damage such as tearing and micron-meteorite impact. In thisxxxxxx I xxxxxx project, we propose to test the feasibility of three key technological changes which couldsubstantially reduce the volume, mass, and power requirement of the TD-THz instrumentation, making itmore suitable for use by an operator in space. The current instrumentation paradigm is that a multi-purposeTD-THz control unit is used to provide common drive, data acquisition, and analysis functionality tointerchangeable sensors and imaging which connect to the control unit with a fiber-optic/electricalumbilical. xxxxxxver, the current COTS control unit is substantially larger and heavier than would bedesirable for a space-flight capable unit. The proposed developments would enable a control unit for ahand held NDE imaging tool, sufficiently robust for spaceflight, no larger than a small shoebox. It shouldbe possible to reduce the size of the control unit to approximately one sixth of the current values to, forexample, 14 in. X 8 in. X 4 in and 10 pounds.	13213
Improved Efficiency of Small Core Turbines through Tip Leakage and Secondary Flow Mitigation, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx Aeronautics xxxxxxearch Mission Directorate has declared ultra-efficient commercial air vehicles a strategic area for development in the coming decade. With no foreseeable alternatives, advanced gas turbine propulsion will continue to power future subsonic transport aircraft. As a result, engine manufacturers are devoting significant effort to increasing fuel efficiency and pushing engines toward higher fan bypass ratios (BPRs). With fan speed already limiting allowable fan sizes, higher BPR requires new, smaller engine cores. xxxxxxver, component efficiency tends to decrease with decreasing size due in part to enhanced tip leakage and secondary flows. Many of the existing technologies designed to mitigate losses associated with these flow structures have only been investigated in conventional machines, under steady approximations, and/or in single components or stages. Also, they often address only a particular loss mechanism in a given flow structure. The proposed xxxxxx project innovates on existing mitigation strategies from a practical, holistic perspective to generate novel aerodynamic devices tailored to improve the efficiency of multi-stage, small-core turbines while also accounting for their inherently unsteady nature. The proposed devices, including tip leakage control and endwall treatments for secondary flow control, will be designed by accounting for each loss mechanism in the targeted flow structure and the device's influence on the unsteady flow field in the current stage and upstream and downstream stages. Successful designs will ensure increases in component efficiency also increase engine overall efficiency by avoiding offsetting reduction in loss in one stage with increased loss in another. In xxxxxx I, numerical simulations will be used to devise and characterize feasible loss mitigation technologies. This foundational work will provide justification for comprehensive analysis and experimental evaluation of the most promising concepts in xxxxxx.	13214

The work involves exploring benefits of low-gravity for innovative control of liquid spreading during extrusion, and quantifying the proper conditions for embedding composite fibers in the thermosets. The proposed effort includes these technical tasks: (i) xxxxxx analytical simulations of the proposed ISAM methodology. (ii) Extrude droplets, puddles, and linear beads of thermal-curing thermosets on heated surfaces, and compare to simulations.

A Low-Power Medical Oxygen Generator, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	An on-board oxygen concentrator is required during long duration manned space missions to supply medical oxygen.  The commercial medical oxygen generators based on pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are large and highly power intensive.  TDA xxxxxxearch, xxxxxx. (TDA) proposes to develop a small, lightweight, portable oxygen generator based on a vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) to produce concentrated medical oxygen.  The unit uses ambient vehicle cabin air as the feed and delivers high purity oxygen while meeting xxxxxx requirements for high flow capacity, closed-loop tissue oxygen control and operation in microgravity/partial gravity.  TDA's VSA system uses a modified version of the lithium exchanged low silica X zeolite (Li-LSX), a state-of-the-art air separation sorbent extensively used in commercial Portable xxxxxx Concentrators (POCs) to enhance the N2 adsorption capacity.  In xxxxxx I, we will demonstrate the scientific, technical, and commercial feasibility of the oxygen concentrator module (OCM).  The concentrator will have an adjustable pressure output to produce 2-15 lpm of O2 at 50 percent to more than 90 percent purity from ambient cabin air.  The OCM will be capable of self-regulating the oxygenation of the patient using a closed loop feedback system that senses tissue oxygenation level. We will evaluate the sorbent performance in a breadboard bench-scale prototype under simulated microgravity/partial gravity exploration atmospheres and carry out a 10,000 cycle test (at a minimum) to determine its long-term performance and mechanical durability.  xxxxxx on the experimental results, we will carry design the demonstration unit, optimize its power draw over the range of flows and oxygen levels, and determine its weight, volume and heat rejection requirements. This design will also include an inlet filter designed to remove potential smoke or toxic gases.	13217

Development and Characterization of Fast Burning Solid Fuels/Propellants for Hybrid Rocket Motors with High Volumetric Efficiency	2015-08-01	2018-07-19	The objective of this proposed work is to develop several fast burning solid fuels/fuel-rich solid propellants for hybrid rocket motor applications. In the formulation and processing studies, the following factors will be considered: utilization of energetic ingredients with high volumetric heating rates in the fuel matrix, selection of high density and high specific impulse formulations for attaining attractive propulsive performance, selection of fuel composition with favorable mechanical properties and ease of handling and processing. Candidate fuels/fuel-rich propellants will be processed using vacuum casting facilities at the High Pressure Combustion xxxxxx (xxxxxxL) of The xxxxxx State xxxxxxersity. The selected formulations with desirable propulsive performance will be cast into fuel grains to be tested in several hybrid rocket motors for determination of their burning characteristics. Under previous contracts, similar fuel grain processing and evaluation have been conducted at xxxxxxL.xxxxxxanced diagnostic systems such as: a real-time X-ray radiography system, an ultrasound pulse-echo system, and a three-color pyrometer system will be utilized in the rocket motor test firings. An existing bi-directional vortex hybrid motor combustor at xxxxxxL will also be used to investigate the degree of further enhancement of fuel-regression rates due to swirl motions of the oxidizer stream for pressures up to 8.4 MPa (1200 psig). Three commonly used oxidizers (gaseous oxygen, 75% hydrogen peroxide, and nitrous oxide) have been used at xxxxxxL for hybrid motor firings. One of them will be selected as the standard oxidizer for comparing the combustion performance of different fuels. A high-speed digital camera can also be incorporated in the vortex hybrid motor to film the in situ regression behavior of a cylindrical fuel grain. In all hybrid motor tests, multiple high-frequency pressure transducers will be installed at different locations for recording pressure-time traces and detecting any combustion instabilities.The anticipated results include: demonstration of the processing feature of various high burning rate solid fuels/propellants, analysis of the hybrid rocket motor firing data to report the combustion behavior of the selected fuel formulations, and demonstration of at least two major solid fuel candidates with highly desirable combustion characteristics for stable burning under realistic hybrid motor operations. The major impact of this project is to show that high regression rate solid fuels/propellants with high volumetric loading density can be achieved in a laboratory scale motor (less than 30 lbs of fuel). Such type of fuel grains can be applied to much larger-scale motors for future space propulsion applications.	13219
Metrics for Offline Evaluation of Prognostic Performance	2013-07-29	2018-07-19	Prognostic performance evaluation has gained significant attention in the past few years.*Currently, prognostics concepts lack standard definitions and suffer from ambiguous and inconsistent interpretations. This lack of standards is in part due to the varied end- user requirements for different applications, time scales, available information, domain dynamics, etc. to name a few. The research community has used a variety of metrics largely based on convenience and their respective requirements. Very little attention has been focused on establishing a standardized approach to compare different efforts. This paper presents several new evaluation metrics tailored for prognostics that were recently introduced and were shown to effectively evaluate various algorithms as compared to other conventional metrics. Specifically, this paper presents a detailed discussion on how these metrics should be interpreted and used. These metrics have the capability of incorporating probabilistic uncertainty estimates from prognostic algorithms. In addition to quantitative assessment they also offer a comprehensive visual perspective that can be used in designing the prognostic system. Several methods are suggested to customize these metrics for different applications. Guidelines are provided to help choose one method over another based on distribution characteristics. Various issues faced by prognostics and its performance evaluation are discussed followed by a formal notational framework to help standardize subsequent developments.	13220

To design and implement an in-house flight modular xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxnics (PSE) suitable for small satellite science missions; especially to support the xxxxxx xxxxxx Smallsat Architecture (xxxxxx).This research will have the following direct return on investment:In-house design reduces risk because we take control over all phases: design, parts selection, layout, assembly, integration and test, and tailor them to meet any unique science mission.We first focus on circuit functionality to be tested with automotive EE components for smaller footprint, lower cost, and short lead time. In the meantime, we consider space-grade components as an optional recommendation for future missions which involved in a specific radiation environment. The risk will be reduced by validating the final architecture, performing the initial component market searches, testing candidate components, and demonstrating a working prototype board.	13221
GPU-Accelerated Sparse Matrix Solvers for Large-Scale Simulations, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Many large-scale numerical simulations can be broken down into common mathematical routines.  While the applications may differ, the need to perform functions such as matrix solves, xxxxxx transforms, or eigenvalue analysis routinely arise.  Consequently, targeting fast, efficient implementations of these methods will benefit a large number of applications.  xxxxxx (xxxxxx) are emerging as an attractive platform to perform these types of simulations.  There FLOPS/xxxxxx and FLOPS/dollar figures are far below competing alternatives.  In previous work, EM Photonics has implemented dense matrix solvers using a hybrid GPU/multicore microprocessor approach.  This has shown the ability to significantly outperform either platform when used independently.  In this project, we will develop a complimentary library focused on performing routines on sparse matrices.  This will be extremely valuable to a wide set of users including those doing finite-element analysis and computational fluid dynamics.  Using xxxxxx, users are able to build single workstations with an excess of four teraFLOPS of computational power as well as create large, high-performance computing systems that are efficient in terms of both cost and power.  By leveraging libraries such as the ones we will develop for this project, the user is shielded from the intricacies of GPU programming while still able to access their computational performance.	13222

It requires both imaging and, working in the same optical train, a grism allowing slitless spectroscopy of 10,000&rsquo;s of objects across the same large field of view. The targeted outcomes from this IRAD are the mature optical and mechanical housing designs of the parfocal [same focal position as the filters held in the same element wheel] grism [a grism is a combination prism plus diffraction grating that sends a spectrum to what is otherwise an imaging focal plane] assembly, specifications of optical components, fabrication approach, and tolerances.&nbsp; The fabrication feasibility will be verified by a funded design study from selected vendors.&nbsp; If feasible, the element design and fabrication procedure will be developed by the vendors.&nbsp; The original objective was to ensure that the grism assembly can be designed and fabricated to meet the WFIRST spectrometer requirements.

From optical design point of view, this IRAD will study how much we can further simplify the grism design without compromising the scientific objectives.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll make every effort to search for all state of art optical fabrication techniques and to design the optics that uses the most suitable technologies.&nbsp; This is one way to raise xxxxxx level.&nbsp; On the other hand, we&#39;ll fund the potential vendors to study and design the element(s) to our specification.&nbsp; We will interact with them and leverage their expertise to raise the xxxxxx.&nbsp; &nbsp;Meanwhile, we&#39;ll encourage them to develop new fabrication methods to improve the quality and to reduce the cost. We would like to eliminate the complicated xxxxxx (ZSS), a surface that could provide any surface figure we need to compensate aberrations, from the current design.&nbsp; But we cannot rule it out yet until we have a solid design without ZSS.&nbsp; Therefore, we will fund a potential vendor in this IRAD to study ZSS fabrication.&nbsp; If the funding permits, we will ask the potential vendors to make small scale samples and test them at GSFC. &nbsp;The goal of this IRAD is to achieve xxxxxx 4; the current xxxxxx is roughly xxxxxx 3.During the course of this IRAD, it is discovered that a diffractive lens is a much better way to compensate the&nbsp;wavelength dependent aberration created by&nbsp;a grating in non-collimated space.&nbsp; Besides the much improved&nbsp;image quality, the corss due to unwanted diffraction orders can be spread&nbsp;as an uniform background by skillfully designing the diffractive lens and VSG.The full project includes design a buildable slitless spectrometer, analyze the design and provide tolerance data to mechanical team.&nbsp; The mechanical team will design a cryo assembly with multi-degrees of adjustment.&nbsp; The high risky samples for diffractive lens and VSG will be procured and tested.&nbsp; One good news to report is that grating sample delivered to us this week has a very high diffraction efficiency (over 90%) from today&#39;s test result, which is higher than HST&#39;s ~80% level.This is equivalent to to increase the primary mirror size by 10%.&nbsp; This also makes the uniform background due to unwanted grating much lower.	13223
Stellar Echo Imaging of Exoplanets, Phase I	2017-06-01	2018-07-19	All stars exhibit intensity fluctuations over several time scales, from nanoseconds to days; these intensity fluctuations echo off planetary bodies in the star system and provide an opportunity to detect and image exoplanets using modern computational imaging techniques. A mission utilizing distributed-aperture stellar echo detectors could provide continent-level imaging of exoplanets more readily than interferometric techniques, as high temporal resolution detection is less technically challenging and more cost effective than multi-kilometer-baseline fringe-tracking, particularly in a photon-starved regime. The concept is viable for detecting exoplanets at more diverse orbital inclinations than is possible with transit or radial velocity techniques.	13224

Remote Data Exploration with the Interactive Data Language, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	We propose to develop a tool for xxxxxx researchers based on IDL and DAP for user-friendly remote data access.  A popular data analysis tool in the xxxxxx research community is IDL (xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxuage).

In this TPS material concept, the \"char\" phase is pre-engineered UHT zirconium carbide (Zr(O)C) ceramic fiber pre-forms, which have dual functions of high compressive strength of ligaments and non-recession of fiber components after matrix ablation. To increase the pre-form ligament strength and stiffness, Zr(O)C fiber reinforcements will be combined with the high-modulus carbon fibers.  MG's ablative TPS are designed to retain their shape in extreme environments, thereby reducing the thickness requirement and lowering the TPS total mass, which will be crucial at high re-entry velocity.MG's new ablator slowly absorbs high levels of energy when ablated at higher temperatures. The ablative carbonaceous phase has been identified by the use of a melamine-formaldehyde and/or polyethylene polymer resin. This selection was based upon its high heat of volatilization and decomposition.

ZnO Piezoelectric Nanowires for Use in a Self-Powered Structural Health Monitoring Device for Fiber-Reinforced Composites Uploading Attachment Instructions	2018-08-01	2018-07-19	The goal of this proposed research is to develop a new self-powered structural health monitoring (SHM) system for fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites by using piezoelectric zinc oxide (xxxxxx) nanowires grown directly into the composite. This new SHM system can increase the safety and reliability of existing aerospace structures, reduce current maintenance costs, and improve several material properties of composites used in aerospace structures. Specifically, the proposed work will (1) investigate multiple methods of growing xxxxxx nanowires in FRP composites on a large scale, (2) quantify the power generation of the xxxxxx nanowires in FRP composite samples for use in energy harvesting (EH), and (3) determine the accuracy of the piezoelectric xxxxxx nanowires in detecting the location and extent of damage for SHM in FRP composites. This work is relevant due to its broad application in aerospace structures. FRP composites are increasing in use in the aeronautical and aerospace industries due to their high strength-to-weight ratio, but they are subject to damage. Because of this risk, attention has been given to SHM which uses piezoelectric materials to obtain real-time information regarding the overall damage condition of a structure. The sensors or systems of sensors used in SHM require a power source which may be difficult to provide, replace, or dispose of which further motivates EH, or the harvesting and application of power generated by piezoelectric materials during the ambient vibrations of a structure. The proposed research combines the preliminary research and technology developed into a comprehensive self-powered SHM system using piezoelectric nanowires for application in aerospace structures. To accomplish the stated objectives, a series of tasks are proposed. The first task is to build upon and improve existing techniques for growing xxxxxx nanowires on test coupons to facilitate application on larger samples. This will be done by investigating the use of an atomizer to create a fine mist for deposition of an initial layer of amorphous xxxxxx for seeding. The xxxxxx nanowires will then be grown using a low temperature hydrothermal synthesis technique, and the multi-layer carbon fiber reinforced composites will be fabricated using a hand-layup system. The second task is to quantify the amount of power generated by the larger scale piezoelectric xxxxxx samples and implement techniques to increase the strain of the sample thus increasing power generation. The multi-layer composites will be placed in a cantilever configuration and excited at their first natural frequency with a range of applied impedance loads. Ohm's xxxxxx will then be used to calculate the power generated. xxxxxxreasing the size of the sample, adding tip mass, and increasing the base excitation rate will all be investigated in order to increase the power generated by the piezoelectric nanowires. The third task is to determine and analyze the use of the xxxxxx samples in impedance testing for SHM by applying a range of high frequency vibrations and using an impedance analyzer. A controlled amount of damage will be applied to the samples varying in extent and location and the corresponding impedance data from the analyzer will be evaluated in order to determine damage correlation. Due to the electromechanical coupling of the nanowires, change in the mechanical impedance (i.e. damage) of the structure will correlate with change in the electrical impedance of the signal. The fourth task will then be the analysis of xxxxxx samples in SHM using the guided wave method. Using the piezoelectric nanowires simultaneously as sensors and actuators, an electrical signal can be both sent and received by an organized array of nanowires. Any reflection or alteration of the sensed signal will indicate an interaction with damage in the structure. A combination of both the impedance and guided wave methods will then be reviewed for an accurate and effective SHM system.	13239

The proposed humidity sensors will use individually coded SAW device structures combined with hygroscopic film elements to produce rapid, sensitive humidity sensors capable of wireless operation over the full range of relative humidity (0% to 100%).  The xxxxxx I research will utilize the results obtained in ASR&D's coded SAW sensor and wireless interrogation system research, and external research on SAW-based and nanofilm based humidity sensing techniques.  The team will evaluate hygroscopic films previously investigated and novel nanostructured films, along with sensor device simulation, to determine which films are most likely to produce devices with desirable characteristics.  Issues including formation of chemically selective films on piezoelectric substrates, optimization of this film, and the effects of environmental factors on device performance will be investigated.  Successful completion of the proposed xxxxxx I activities will establish the technical feasibility of producing the proposed humidity sensors, evaluate their potential performance capabilities in a range of operational environments, and define the additional work necessary to effect device implementation.  Assuming the results of xxxxxx I are positive, xxxxxx could result in the development of multiple uniquely identifiable, wirelessly interrogable, humidity sensors.	13240

Theincreasing demands on NDE to address inspection reliability in the areaof health monitoring and remaining life assessment demand thatquantitative engineering tools be available so that cost effectengineering analysis on inspectibility limits and optimal inspectionprotocols be done.  Most NDE techniques, as they move to a more digitalformat, generate terabytes of data for a single scan.  X-ray methodsgenerally have high computational needs.  Until recently extractinginformation from massive data sets was impossible due to limitedcomputation capabilities.  By applying the emerging massively parallelgraphic processing cards (GPU) to a CT simulation, SimCT, we have ameans to address the quantitative modeling in an important NDE methodneeded to characterize materials in support of health monitoringactivities.  The computational techniques using GPU platforms and thedata analysis methods developed in the x-ray area apply to any NDEmethod.

An Advanced Cooling System for In-Situ Resource Utilization, Phase II	2012-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx plans to produce cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen to power regenerative fuel cells for lunar surface exploration.  The oxygen and hydrogen will be produced by electrolysis of water from xxxxxx xxxxxxource Utilization (ISRU) reactors.  The electrolysis products will be warm high-pressure gases, requiring significant cryocooler power to achieve the desired storage conditions.  This power can be reduced by expanding the gases adiabatically from the electrolysis pressure to storage pressure.  We propose to develop innovative turboalternators to maximize this effect and convert the extracted fluid power into useful electric power.  Small flow rates and high fluid densities require turbine rotors that are extremely small and operate at high speeds.  xxxxxxgenic gas bearings and miniature rotor fabrication techniques are key features that create high efficiency in our approach.  The gas bearings also enable reliable, long-life, maintenance-free operation.  The proposed development will leverage decades of Creare experience with cryogenic gas-bearing turbomachines.

Optical Downconverting Nanomaterials for Enhanced Photovoltaic Efficiency, Phase I	2009-02-01	2018-07-19	For photovoltaic cells used to power space missions, such as those based on silicon, xxxxxx, and xxxxxx-V materials, optical-to-electrical conversion efficiency is reduced by at least 25% because the energy of solar photons in excess of the band gap of the semiconductor absorber is lost. The excess photon energy is converted to heat. In addition, the quantum efficiencies of solar cells tend to degrade for high energy photons due to surface recombination effects. xxxxxxical down-conversion has been suggested as a method to recoup this lost energy, providing an increase in the theoretical single junction photovoltaic conversion efficiency from 30.9% to 39.6%. If substantial gains in PV efficiency could be achieved with a thin film coating of an efficient two photon downconverting layer, it would have a tremendous benefit not only to xxxxxx payload burden, but also the the economics of terrestrial solar cells.  xxxxxxver, the absence of materials with suitable time constants for the relevant electronic processes has hindered the realization of this method. Our proposed solution, being developed by the xxxxxxersity of xxxxxx, is to use the unique optical properties of nanocrystals to produce efficient downconverting emitter materials. xxxxxx I will entail synthesis of the new materials at EIC xxxxxxoratories and their optical evaluation at xxxxxx, with a goal of demonstrating the first practical examples of such a thin film material.	13248

Real-Time Probabilistic Structural Health Management Using Machine Learning and GPU Computing Project	2016-09-01	2018-07-19	The proposed project seeks to deliver an ultra-efficient, high-fidelity structural health management (SHM) framework using machine learning and graphics processing unit (GPU) computing, exploring how far the latency limits can be pushed towards real-time feedback. The approach will be to parallelize and unify two recent xxxxxx-developed damage diagnosis and prognosis algorithms that utilize statistical surrogate models for efficient uncertainty quantification. External expertise from the Old Dominion xxxxxxersity Department of Computer xxxxxx will be leveraged to assist in parallelizing these algorithms for emerging many-core high performance computing architectures. The result will be low latency software which can use experimental sensor data to probabilistically characterize structural damage and then simulate how that damage will propagate and affect a vehicle&#39;s remaining useful life. An effective structural health management (SHM) system provides sensor data to a diagnosis algorithm that characterizes structural damage and then relies on prognosis software to simulate how that damage will affect a vehicle&rsquo;s remaining useful life. The critical nature of SHM applications motivates high-fidelity and low-latency feedback while the noisy sensor data and approximate computational models used necessitate rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ). Unfortunately, high-fidelity modeling implies time-consuming simulations and UQ often requires tens of thousands of them. Furthermore, the algorithms that drive probabilistic damage diagnosis are traditionally sequential in nature, preventing the straightforward application of parallel processing to alleviate the computational burden. Thus, achieving such an all-encompassing SHM framework is extremely challenging from a software development standpoint.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two recent xxxxxx xxxxxx studies address the probabilistic diagnosis and prognosis problems independently. Both employ machine learning to replace expensive physics-based simulations with statistical surrogate models to reduce the computation time. While demonstrating significant gains in efficiency, both employed conventional sequential implementations and therefore do not scale well with problem complexity. A new but widely accepted work, however, opens the door for parallelism in such probabilistic analyses.&nbsp; The objective of the proposed research here is to utilize this novel parallel algorithm to migrate the xxxxxx-developed diagnosis and prognosis methods to emerging many-core high performance computing (xxxxxx) architectures. Ultimately, the project aims to then combine the two GPU-accelerated algorithms into one comprehensive framework for low-latency, high-fidelity SHM with UQ.&nbsp;	13251
Unmanned Solar Electric Resource Prospector, Phase I	2016-06-01	2018-07-19	The proposed innovation is a spacecraft that could be used for lunar or asteroid prospecting missions. The mission plan would involve sending the spacecraft to an asteroid or other target, and analyzing the regolith for traces of water and other elements to be mined later for in-situ resource utilization. The system features multiple innovations.  One is game-changing high delta V solar electric propulsion (SEP) system featuring a hall thruster flowing iodine propellant.  Another is a small tethered satellite with an on-board propulsion system that can be used as a modular working arm for the main spacecraft.  The proposed xxxxxx I program includes mission analysis, spacecraft, bus, and propellant module design, and identification of sensors and tools to be used for prospecting and plume analysis.  xxxxxx I also includes development of an iodine plasma spacecraft interactions model, which is a necessary precursor to any deep space mission with iodine propellant.  In xxxxxx, the entire system including the spacecraft interactions model will be brought to a higher technology readiness level.  Both xxxxxx I and xxxxxx will include plasma plume measurements to support model development and analysis.	13252
Intercalated and Hydrogenated Carbon Nanofibers for Multifunctional Radiation Protection, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	Improvements in radiation shielding materials are needed to support xxxxxx human and robotic exploration programs.  Shielding for both electromagnetic radiation (gamma and x-rays) and particles (protons and neutrons) are critical.  Ideally, the shielding should be part of a multifunctional, structural composite material to maximize mission payload.  To meet this need, ASI will develop structural composites enhanced by novel carbon nanofiber (CNF) materials.  One version is CNF whose hollow cores are filled with heavy elements for electromagnetic by a novel intercalation technique. Another is hydrogenated CNF for particle shielding.  The enhanced CNF will then be included in the resin of a standard carbon fiber reinforced structural composites where they will add radiation blocking functionality and enhance strength properties.  In addition, the intercalated nanofibers will be compounded into polyethylene, a known proton absorber, to create a shielding material that simultaneously blocks all relevant forms of radiation.  Materials will be tested for gamma, x-ray, and proton shielding, as well as multifunctional structural and electrical properties.	13253
Multi-Robot Planetary Exploration Architectures, Phase II	2012-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx policy direction is shifting, particularly with respect to human goals.  Given the uncertainty of future missions to the moon, xxxxxx, and other bodies, a tool that allows for informed analysis of the option space is particularly relevant.  xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxs and MIT propose to further develop the xxxxxx-Robot xxxxxx Exploration Architecture (MRPEA) methodology, a suite of software tools and analysis algorithms developed to provide decision aides to architecture planners of planetary surface exploration missions.  MRPEA provides 1. A logical and graphical representation of the system space (e.g. interrelated decision variables with constraints), 2. Structural reasoning for rapid exploration of architectural spaces, 3. Simulation, and 4. xxxxxxults viewing for a set of feasible architectures.  Given the robots available or predicted to be available, the expected duration, and the mission goals, our methodology provides analysis results such as knowledge benefit-vs.-mass xxxxxx front graphs, to allow the designers to provide the best possible architecture for the planned mission or missions.  The MRPEA analysis methodology primarily addresses the planning requirements of planetary surface missions, providing useful analyses of the many elements of the architectural decision space; in addition, the principles and techniques developed to analyze and select multi-robot architectures on planetary surfaces can also be applied to future fractional satellite systems, an area of increasing interest.	13254

This task developed analytical methods for low temperature performance.   xxxxxx narrowing was shown to be the underlying reason for the large decrease in npn transistor gain at low temperature. Furthermore, we have developed analytical methods for radiation damage in combination with low temperature.  This model reproduces our experimental results of temperature dependent radiation damage yields.

Desensitized Optimal Filtering and Sensor Fusion Tool Kit, Phase II	2013-11-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxearch on desensitized optimal filtering techniques and a navigation and sensor fusion tool kit using advanced filtering techniques is proposed. xxxxxxearch focuses on reducing the sensitivity of xxxxxx filters with respect to model parameter uncertainties using a robust trajectory optimization approach called Desensitized xxxxxximal Control, developed by the proposing company. The proposed tool kit implements the research results as well as recent advances in robust and/or adaptive generalized xxxxxx and xxxxxx-Point filters for xxxxxx problems with uncertain error statistics.The proposed research and development brings new filtering and sensor fusion techniques to xxxxxx and industry in a convenient package which can be used as a stand-alone toolbox, either for ground support or for onboard applications. Its modular structure enables it to be readily integrated with other tools, and thus enhances the existing fleet of applications.The desensitized optimal filtering research and the feasibility study on components of the proposed tool kit will be carried out concurrently. The tool kit is a generic stand-alone application, and has a modularized structure which facilitates easy integration with existing tools. A suite of sensor models and noise distributions as well as xxxxxx analysis capability are included to enable statistical performance evaluations.	13256
Miniaturized, Low Power Cryogenic Inlet System with Sampling Probes for Titan, Phase II	2008-12-01	2018-07-19	Thorleaf xxxxxxearch, xxxxxx. has demonstrated feasibility in xxxxxx and now proposes a xxxxxx 2 effort to develop a miniature, low power cryogenic inlet system with sampling probes for xxxxxx. This addresses a key technology gap for planetary studies, mainly how to acquire and prepare complex cryogenic samples of astrobiology interest for in situ analysis while meeting challenging mass, volume and power constraints. The proposed sampling system is designed to collect surface samples at xxxxxx 94K (-179C) cryogenic temperatures using two different miniature probe designs, one for collecting atmospheric aerosols, dust or particles, and another for surface penetration. The samples, which are presumed to include hydrocarbons, nitriles, tholins and other materials, can then be thermally processed by vaporization, thermal desorption or pyrolysis to prepare them for chemical analysis by GC/MS, GC/IMS or other techniques.  Our xxxxxx results have demonstrated feasibility for developing a miniaturized cryogenic sampling inlet system with sampling probes weighing on the order of 100g with a peak power consumption of 20 watts or less. Because vaporization, thermal desorption or pyrolysis heating would only be required for a few seconds during each chemical analysis duty cycle, we project average power usage at a fraction of a watt.	13257

Grain Boundary Engineering for Assessing Durability and Aging Issues with Nickel-Based Superalloys, Phase I	2007-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx Technologies xxxxxx xxxxxx.(xxxxxx, PA) is pleased to providethis proposal in response to the Small Business xxxxxxovation xxxxxxearch(xxxxxx) Request for xxxxxx (RFP) (#A1.03), &quot;xxxxxx Aging andDurability&quot;. A material characterization technology is proposedthat is based on grain boundary structure-property relationship toimprove prediction of component life for nickel based superalloys. Sinceit has been well documented that the resistance to intergranulardegradation is a function of the special (i.e., structurally orderedlow- grain boundaries) grain boundary content in the material, theimprovement in bulk material performance can be achieved through carefulmanipulation of the processing parameters to increase the presence ofthese special interfaces.  The proposed program builds upon results ofprevious proprietary developments by the applicant in the areas of themicrostructural optimization via metallurgical thermo-mechanicalprocessing and the developed modeling concept based on grain boundarystructure assessment. The program will involve material synthesis,testing and characterization activities with a specific emphasis oncorrelating the materials performance with respect to the grain boundarymicrostructure. The objective for this phase I program is to establishthe inter-relationship amongst material processing, grain boundarycharacter distribution, corrosion and deformation behaviour of thematerial.  As a result of significant advances already made in thedevelopment of grain boundary engineering, the program proposed hereinis expected to have a high probability of success and can potentiallylead to a cost-effective technology for mitigating the susceptibility tomicrostructural instability and corrosion associated with Ni-basedsuperalloys. This program is expected to require six (6) months forcompletion at a total cost of $100,000.	13259
Direct hydrogenation of CO2 to ethylene	2021-08-01	2018-07-19	Minimization of the launch mass for long-term space missions will require the establishment of sustainable manufacturing techniques that use raw materials sourced through in-situ resource utilization (ISRU). xxxxxx dioxide gas (xxxxxx) is a readily available carbon source on space missions, but methods to transform it into more valuable chemicals are currently severely limited. xxxxxxation of xxxxxx is a particularly attractive transformation in the context of space exploration because the other necessary reactant, hydrogen gas (H2), is accessible via electrolysis of water. xxxxxxver, industrial xxxxxx hydrogenation chemistry is limited to the production of C1 products that are of low synthetic value. The proposed research project will investigate a novel method to effect the direct hydrogenation of xxxxxx to ethylene (C2H4), which is a valuable feedstock chemical used in the industrial production of polyethylene (PE) plastics. If optimized, this chemistry could enable the production of PE for on-site manufacturing in space.The proposed xxxxxx hydrogenation process uses no solvents or transition metal catalysts, and is instead catalyzed by an alkali carbonate hydrate salt (M2CO3*xxxxxxx). Preliminary results show that subjecting an alkali carbonate to a mixed atmosphere of H2 and xxxxxx at elevated temperature and pressure can result in a mixture of products including carboxylate salts and modest quantities of ethylene. This research seeks to improve the rate and selectivity of ethylene formation through a combination of mechanistic studies and process optimization. xxxxxx goals include a thorough elucidation of the reaction mechanism, optimization of the initial salt composition and reaction conditions for ethylene production, and design of a high-pressure flow reactor system that allows for precise, real-time control over the reactant mixture composition.	13260
Low-Cost, High-Performance Combustion Chamber for LOX/CH4 Propulsion, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx will design and fabricate a lightweight, high temperature 5-lbf combustion chamber for use with cryogenic liquid oxygen/methane (LOX/xxxxxx) propellant that will deliver a specific impulse of ~355 seconds, an increase over the current 320-sec baseline that will result in a propellant mass decrease of 55 lbm. The material system will be based on xxxxxx's proven oxide-iridium/rhenium architecture, which has been successfully hot-fire tested with stoichiometric oxygen/hydrogen for hours. Instead of rhenium, however, the structural material will be a niobium alloy that has excellent high temperature yield strength. With a yield strength-to-weight ratio over 33% greater than that of rhenium at elevated temperature, this niobium alloy will significantly reduce chamber weight. The starting materials are two orders of magnitude less expensive than rhenium and are less expensive than the C103 alloy commonly used in low-performance engines. xxxxxx will design the chamber in xxxxxx I and will perform hot-fire testing in xxxxxx. xxxxxx will include scaleup of the process and testing of a chamber in the 25- to 500-lbf thrust class, which would be suitable for a reaction control system engine on a lunar ascent/descent vehicle.	13261
Bio-Inspired Autonomous Communications Systems with Anomaly Detection Monitoring, Phase I	2014-12-01	2018-07-19	"We propose to develop and demonstrate xxxxxxComm, a bio-inspired autonomous communications system (ACS) aimed at dynamically reconfiguring and redeploying autonomous communication assets in accordance with both mission objectives and communication demands simultaneously. xxxxxxComm is embedded with xxxxxx (xxxxxx and xxxxxx) capability, which enables human supervisors or operators to exploit, benefit from, and interact with xxxxxxComm systems with high confidence by alerting the operators of multiple, heterogeneous ACSs on anomalous system behaviors without requiring a deep understanding of the functions in the underlying systems. The proposed solution (xxxxxxComm-xxxxxx) is based on the unique combination of: (i) Digital Hormone xxxxxx augmented with Criticality-Sensitive Control with the goal of achieving rapid self-configuration and fully autonomous adaptive deployment, redeployment, and reconfiguration of xxxxxx autonomous communication assets under a broad range of mission scenarios; and (ii) Surprise-xxxxxx Learning capable of learning the expected or normal behavior of a wide range of autonomous systems, detect any behavioral anomalies or deviations from the norm, identify potential causes, recommend some feasible changes to a human supervisor, and execute the selected or recommended changes. The xxxxxxComm system adds a powerful new degree of freedom for self-adaptation, which is the \"mobility\" of autonomous communication assets based on their awareness of the \"communication environment\", thus allowing radios to adapt both their software parameters and physical locations or formations so as to best support space missions. Thus, xxxxxxComm will greatly expand the feasible dimensions of self-adaptation for communication parameters by further allowing the autonomous assets to \"move\" to \"right\" places when the autonomous adaptation of parameters alone is not sufficient in order to achieve  much greater and powerful autonomous end-to-end communication capabilities."	13262
Swarm Flyby Gravimetry (Phase II)	2017-06-01	2018-07-19	We propose a method for discerning the gravity fields and sub-surface mass distribution of a solar system small body, without requiring dedicated orbiters or landers. In this concept, a spacecraft releases a swarm of small, low-cost probes during a flyby past an asteroid or comet. By tracking those probes, we can estimate the asteroid's gravity field and infer its underlying composition and porosity. This approach offers a diverse measurement set, equivalent to planning and executing many independent and unique flyby encounters of a single spacecraft. The resulting dataset can yield a global model of the body's mass distribution and reveal unique aspects of the body's interior that are otherwise unobservable. This concept offers the possibility of achieving new scientific measurements that extend our understanding of our solar system, benefit human spaceflight, and support planetary defense. It also represents a practical deep space application of the swarm paradigm that is common in other fields, in that the ensemble of deployed probes enables fundamentally new measurement sets. In xxxxxx I we established a basic feasibility of the concept by simulating a series of asteroid encounters and evaluating the available tracking methods. In xxxxxx, we intend to address the key remaining risks and concerns by increasing the fidelity of our simulations, evaluating important trades, considering other relevant mission contexts, and prototyping and characterizing the dispenser and probes. These activities will be informed by active engagement with mission science and engineering leadership, with the objective of identifying a path forward for implementation.	13263
Space-Qualified 1064 nm Seed and Metrology Laser, Phase I	2004-07-01	2018-07-19	A space-qualified, single-frequency oscillator operating at 1064 nm is a critical component for a number of active optical measurement systems that have been proposed for both ground and space-based xxxxxx missions.  These include metrology for space-based interferometers, direct detection wind lidar systems, atmospheric aerosol measurement systems, and  differential absorption lidar (DIAL) systems for ozone measurement.  These applications all require a frequency-stabilized cw 1064 nm oscillator with an output power in the 10-100 mW range.  We propose to design and build a space-qualified version of the required laser oscillator.  We will base our design on a diode-pumped microchip laser.  It will incorporate both active temperature control and locking to a narrow molecular absorption to provide a high level of frequency stabilization.  Redundant diode pumps, thermally and mechanically robust packing, and a careful choice of materials to minimize contamination effects will ensure the design will be space qualifiable.  Our xxxxxx I work will demonstrate that the key technology goals can be met in a space qualifiable design.  In xxxxxx we will accomplish the detailed design, assembly, and qualification of a space-qualified single frequency laser that meets the required performance goals.	13264

We will design a temperature and flow sensor that will be compatible with other xxxxxx funded micro fluidic systems. This design is a proof-of-concept sensor that has the ability to sense temperature and flow rate changes. Furthermore, this can be calibrated using macro-scale systems.&nbsp;	13266
SOUL System Maturation, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx Co. xxxxxx. proposes to advance the maturity of an innovative xxxxxx on Umbilical xxxxxx (SOUL) xxxxxx suitable for a wide variety of applications of interest to xxxxxx, DoD and commercial missions.  SOUL is a small (<10kg) robotic, self-propelled, self-navigating, autonomous vehicle equipped with a tool (e.g. gripper, light, camera etc.).  The SOUL vehicle/robot is attached via the umbilical line to a larger host spacecraft that stows it in a marsupial-like manner and communicates with ground. The umbilical delivers power and commands to SOUL from the host spacecraft.  Conceptually, the SOUL is a tool on the end of  tens of meters long robotic arm with infinite degrees of freedom (flexible umbilical) that can access locations unreachable by conventional robotic arms. The initial purpose of the xxxxxxF and Navy funded SOUL development was removal of large space debris (1000kg class).  SOUL has broad applicability including visual inspection and servicing of the host vehicle or other spacecraft and asteroid sample pickup.  Under this program, the development of the SOUL vehicle was extremely successful exceeding all goals.  The SOUL autonomously recognized simulated debris, estimated its pose relative to the target (fusing visible, IR images and IMU information), planned a path to the debris and executed the path and the touched the target with minimal momentum transfer.  The demonstrations were performed on large, low friction air table.  In the proposed effort xxxxxx will focus on the development of the deployment/retrieval subsystem which is the least mature technology of the SOUL system.  Demonstration of the integrated system will be performed on the air table.  The ultimate goal is to make a flight worthy system and demonstrate it on the xxxxxx.  The specific objective of the xxxxxx is to design, build and test the umbilical line winch and its control system designed on the basis of numerical model that predicts the umbilical line dynamic behavior.	13267
Microfabricated Low-Loss Microwave Switch Integration Technology, Phase I	2010-07-01	2018-07-19	Nuvotronics has developed and optimized the PolyStrataTM process for the fabrication of intricate microwave and millimeter-wave devices.  These devices have primarily been rectangular coaxial transmission lines, although rectangular waveguide and other structures have also been demonstrated.  Intricate devices have been demonstrated with insertion loss 5 to 10 times lower than traditional planar circuits; isolation better than 60dB for lines that share separating walls; multiple levels of densely-packed coaxial circuits; and low-parasitic attachment to active devices and traditional circuit boards.  In this xxxxxx I project, Nuvotronics will deseign microfabricated MEMs-based switches on the Polystrata platform.  Nuvotronics will explore whether piezoelectric-based or magnetic-based actuation provides the best performance for millimeter-wave radiometry applications.  The devices will have size and cost advantages, higher power handling capability, and lower loss than achievable with the commonly available wafer-based switches of today.	13268

MESSENGER MDIS MAP PROJECTED MULTISPECTRAL RDR V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	Abstract ======== The Mercury xxxxxx Imaging xxxxxx (MDIS) consists of two cameras, a Wide xxxxxxle Camera (WAC) and a Narrow xxxxxxle Camera (NAC), mounted on a common pivot platform. This dataset includes the xxxxxxspectral xxxxxxd xxxxxx Records for the WAC. The Map Projected xxxxxxspectral xxxxxx (MDR) data set consists of a global color map of I/F in the 8 filters used for multispectral mapping during the primary mission, photometrically normalized to a solar incidence angle (i) = 30 degrees, emission angle (e) = 0 degrees, and phase angle (g) = 30 degrees at a spatial sampling of 64 pixels per degree. The map is divided into 54 segments or 'tiles', each representing the NW, NE, SW, or SE quadrant of one of the 13 non-polar or one of the 2 polar quadrangles or 'Mercury charts' already defined by the USGS. Each tile is composed of 8 bands corresponding to 8 of the 11 WAC filters. Each tile also contains backplanes describing ancillary information. The subset of 8 of 11 available multispectral filters was selected on account of limitations in MESSENGER solid-state recorder space, and more or less evenly samples the spectral range of MDIS.	13270

1.26 Single Frequency Fiber Laser, Phase II	2012-05-01	2018-07-19	This proposal is for the development of an innovative compact, high power, and extremely reliable 1.26 micron Ho-doped single frequency fiber laser. The proposed single frequency seeder fiber laser consists of xxxxxx pump laser and single frequency 1.26-micron fiber laser, which will be constructed by using Ho3+-doped fluoride glass fiber. A xxxxxx fiber laser is used as a resonant pump laser source for Ho3+-doped fiber laser.  High gain per unit length at 1.26 micron can be achieved in Ho-doped fluoride glass fiber due to the strong pump absorption and strong emission at 1.2 micron transition.  5 W single frequency 1.26-micron MOPA system with high-speed frequency modulation capability will be developed.   It consists of a 1.26 micron single frequency seeder fiber laser and a 2-stage fiber amplifier.This type of fiber based seed laser is needed for remote sensing of O  and O -N  for measuring atmospheric pressure.  The single frequency 1.26-micron fiber laser with high-speed frequency modulation capability and electronic control can be used to build coherent laser radar to perform instantaneous measurement.  It offers much higher resolution compared to currently existing xxxxxx fiber laser.	13274

Instrument for Measurement of Oceanic Particle Size Distribution from Submicron to Mesoplankton, Phase II	2018-04-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxx size distribution (PSD) is a fundamental environmental measurement, with diverse biogeochemical applications including carbon cycle science, ecosystem and fisheries modeling, and harmful algal bloom (HAB) detection/prediction. There is optimism that estimates of PSD will be available from ocean color measurements (such as xxxxxx upcoming PACE mission), and will be able to help constrain global-scale ecosystem/carbon models and estimates of primary production. xxxxxxver, natural PSD variability is not well understood due to the challenges of routine measurement, and there exists little field data over large space and time scales. We propose to bridge this gap by developing an instrument for ship-based flow-through application that uses laser scattering from multiple wavelengths for estimation of the PSD across a wide range of particle sizes from 0.1 to 500 micron, covering a range from the smallest oceanic pico-plankton to larger meso-plankton.	13276
Highly Scalable Matching Pursuit Signal Decomposition Algorithm	2010-09-22	2018-07-19	In this research, we propose a variant of the classical Matching Pursuit Decomposition (MPD) algorithm with significantly improved scalability and computational performance. MPD is a powerful iterative algorithm that decomposes a signal into linear combinations of its dictionary elements or “atoms”. A best fit atom from an arbitrarily defined dictionary is determined through cross-correlation. The selected atom is subtracted from the signal and this procedure is repeated on the residual in the subsequent iterations until a stopping criteria is met.A sufficiently large dictionary is required for an accurate reconstruction; this in return increases the computational burden of the algorithm, thus limiting its applicability and level of adoption. Our main contribution lies in improving the computational efficiency of the algorithm to allow faster decomposition while maintaining a similar level of accuracy. The Correlation Thresholding and xxxxxx Atom Extractions techniques were proposed to decrease the computational burden of the algorithm. Correlation thresholds prune insignificant atoms from the dictionary. The ability to extract multiple atoms within a single iteration enhanced the effectiveness and efficiency of each iteration. The proposed algorithm, entitled MPD++, was demonstrated using real world data set.	13277
Compact Kinetic Mechanisms for Petroleum-Derived and Alternative Aviation Fuels, Phase II	2017-08-01	2018-07-19	To be useful for computational combustor design and analysis using tools like the xxxxxxional Combustion Code (NCC), low-dimensional chemical kinetic mechanisms for modeling of real fuel combustion chemistry must be sufficiently compact so that they can be utilized in multi-dimensional, multi-physics, reacting computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Despite advances in CFD-appropriate kinetic mechanism reduction for kerosene-range fuels, significant combustion property variation among current and prospective certified fuels remains a challenge for meaningful CFD-advised design of high pressure, low-emissions combustors. The proposed project will leverage xxxxxx's ongoing work in aviation fuel surrogate formulation and modeling as well as kinetic mechanism development for emissions and high pressure combustion to produce and demonstrate a meta-model framework for automated generation of fuel-flexible compact chemical kinetic mechanisms appropriate for 3-D combustion CFD codes.During xxxxxx I, Compact xxxxxx for both an alternative, natural-gas derived synthetic kerosene and a conventional petro-derived xxxxxx kerosene have been developed and demonstrated. xxxxxxults indicated that, over a very broad range of pressures, temperatures, equivalence ratios, and characteristic times, these Compact xxxxxx well reproduce predictions of global combustion behaviors (ignition, extinction, heat release rate, pollutant mole fractions) relative to predictions of significantly larger target chemical kinetic mechanisms. Technical objectives for xxxxxx R&D include development of a stand-alone software application for generation of tailor-made, fuel-specific Compact xxxxxx, and demonstration of Compact Mechanism performance in computation-intensive CFD applications. Achievement of these objectives together will advance the current state of this R&D program to xxxxxx 5.	13278
A 3-D Printed Microfluidic Microgravity Microbial Fuel Cell for Satellite Missions	2013-10-01	2018-07-19	This project focused on developing bioelectrochemical test units that could be manufactured principally using additive manufacturing (3D printing) methodologies. These units were specifically being designed for use within unmanned satellite missions that can conduct biological experimentation.&nbsp; The units are microbial fuel cells that were designed as a small-scale, microfluidic microgravity system, with the goal of eventually exploring the effects of microgravity on the bioelectrochemical properties of microbes in space. Preliminary microbial fuel cell units were designed, fabricated and tested, and the results serve to guide ongoing flight experiment hardware concept development. The initial viability of 3D printed reactors was tested using the selected test organism (S. oneidensis MR-1) grown in simple 3D printed cassettes to investigate biocompatibility with the candidate print plastic (ABS). After displaying no significant negative response, growth experiments were conducted on S. oneidensis MR-1 to yield a metabolic baseline metric and cell count measures to determine current/cell output from the MFCs. Additionally, methodologies for testing S. oneidensis activity within the reactor during autonomous (flight) tests were developed. These included optical sensing of colorimetric assays of the reduction of Fe+3 to Fe+2, and voltage and current measurement of exoelectrogenic activity. Test media and reaction electrode configurations (single vs. dual electrodes/chambers) were also studied to increase autonomous testing simplicity and reliability. Additionally, methods for automatically deploying the flight test were investigated, including microbial stasis prior to reanimation, media reconstitution, mixing and filling individual test wells, as well as repeated &ldquo;feeding&rdquo; of the wells for extended testing. xxxxxxernate test organisms were examined, including an E. coli strain that was engineered using synthetic biology techniques to perform extracellular electron transport. Together this resulted in a design that resembled previous small-sat strategies such as PharmaSat, that would be able to provide sufficient test replication and parameterization in a 2-3U configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the bioelectrochemical reactor development, half-shell bioreactors were designed and fabricated using cylindrical wells with carbon felt as the electrode material. Initial prototypes encountered issues in the form of mechanical failure (cracking) during assembly. Several iterations were required before testing yielded valid data, and included improvements in the 3D printer configuration, reactor shell sizing, fluid containment, membrane sealing and electrode configuration. Ultimately, successful data were obtained for voltage and current generation from four bioelectrochemical wells measured in parallel. xxxxxx electron microscope imaging was performed and indicated that S. oneidensis adhered to the carbon felt electrodes (beneficial). More complex reactor configurations were also printed (PharmaSat configuration) but full-scale testing was not attempted. Further refinement of printing resolution and membrane insertion are required.&nbsp;	13279
Surface Operations Data Analysis and Adaptation Tool, Phase I	2005-07-01	2018-07-19	The xxxxxx Management xxxxxx (SMS), developed by xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx in cooperation with the FAA, has received wide and significant acceptance by the air transportation community. The SMS utilizes flight plan data and airport surface surveillance data to track and model the operation of flights on the airport surface. xxxxxxions of flight arrival and departure times from specific runways are generated by SMS. SMS provides these predictions of future airport operations to numerous airport, ATC and air carrier users to create shared situational awareness. xxxxxx continues to conduct advanced research on airport surface traffic management concepts and tools. Fundamental research in this area has been very difficult to conduct in the past, however, due to the lack of electronic data representing airport surface operations. With the current deployment of airport surface surveillance systems, such data is now becoming available.

High Efficiency Lighting with Integrated Adaptive Control (HELIAC), Phase II	2008-01-01	2018-07-19	"The proposed project is the continued development of xxxxxx with xxxxxxted xxxxxxive Control (HELIAC) system.  xxxxxxar radiation is not a viable option for growing plants on the xxxxxx or on xxxxxx for multiple reasons. On the other hand, lighting plants with electric lamps and rejecting the associated waste heat has associated energy costs that have driven xxxxxx toward other options to provide food and fresh air to future xxxxxx crews  The HELIAC lighting system consists of small individual LED \"light engines\" that provide a level of control precision far in excess of standard lamps. This precision enables lamp configuration to be adapted to species specific growth habits so that photons can be absorbed efficiently by all available photosynthetic tissues. HELIAC will also provide the capability to adapt spectral balance automatically to plant development stage. Finally, it will have the capability to automatically detect the proximity of plant tissue and power only adjacent light engines, thereby greatly decreasing power requirements, particularly in the early stage of plant development."	13281
Computational Design of Ageless Structural Materials	2015-10-01	2018-07-19	The focus of this project is to link microstructure, mechanical performance, and processing of additively manufactured titanium alloys.&nbsp; Ultimately, linking such material attributes would permit alloy design (e.g., mechanical performance) by prescribing alloy composition and processing parameters. xxxxxx, the structural optimization of aerospace components has been done through geometric methods.&nbsp; A monolithic material is chosen based on the best compromise between the competing design limiting criteria.&nbsp; Then the structure is geometrically optimized to give the best overall performance using the single material chosen.&nbsp; Functionally graded materials offer the potential to further improve structural efficiency by allowing the material composition and/or microstructural features to spatially vary within a single structure.&nbsp; Thus, local properties could be tailored to the local design limiting criteria.&nbsp; Additive manufacturing techniques enable the fabrication of such graded materials and structures.&nbsp; This paper presents the results of a graded material study using two titanium alloys processed using electron beam freeform fabrication, an additive manufacturing system.&nbsp; The results show that the two alloys uniformly mix at various ratios and the resultant static properties of the mixed alloys behave according to rule-of-mixtures.&nbsp; Additionally, the crack growth behavior across an abrupt change from one alloy to the other shows no discontinuity and the crack smoothly transitions from one crack growth regime into another.&nbsp; &nbsp;	13282
Slow-Light-Enhanced Spectral Interferometers, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	We proposoe a research program aimed at developing spectral interferometers with dramatically enhanced performance.  A key aspect of our approach is to place a highly dispersive (slow-light) material into one arm of a two-path, xxxxxx interferometer (MZI).  Theoretical analysis shows that the spectral resolution under these circumstances can be enhanced by a factor as large as the group index of the slow-light material being used.  Slow-light interferometers can produce dramatic increases in the resolution or a spectrometer or they can permit much smaller physical dimensions than standard spectrometers without any degradation of resolution.  In the present program, we will undertake to develop spectrometers that can be employed under practical conditions and especially those of interest to xxxxxx.  We propose three related approaches to the design of enhanced spectrometers and will perform conceptual to quantify the relative merits of these approaches.  This will allow future work to further develop the most promising design(s).  The three approaches: 1.)  A hybrid interferometer: a Fabry-Perot (FP) interferometer will be placed within a MZ interferometer.  The transfer characteristics of the FP mimic those of a slow-light material.  This design can achieve the same sort of enhancement of sensitivity as that of a true slow-light medium placed inside the MZI. 2.) Our second approach makes use of a similar analogy, but on a much smaller distance scale.  This approach entails the fabrication of wavelength-scale defect resonators in an otherwise perfect photonic crystal (PhC).  The design employs a sequence of such resonators each with a slightly different resonance wavelength.  3.) Our third approach is to fabricate mm-scale interferometers using nano fabrication on silicon.  The slow light medium is a PhC waveguide formed by a line defect in a silicon PhC structure.  We will couple these structures to waveguides in an interferometer configuration.	13283

Generic Launch Window Analyzer SW2M - Applicability to Rideshare Payloads	2018-09-01	2018-07-19	The aim of this IRAD is to build upon the generic launch window analyzer that has been developed under previous IRADs so as to allow it to be applied to rideshare missions, where a secondary spacecraft makes use of the excess performance capability of current launch vehicles.&nbsp; One example of this excess performance is afforded by the launch of xxxxxx-8 on an xxxxxx V: in order to dispose of the xxxxxx stage after launch, it was not deorbited, but rather injected into a heliocentric escape trajectory.	13287

Elastic Films for Cyrogenic Skin Friction Measurements, Phase I	2009-07-01	2018-07-19	Here we introduce a new sensor for measurement of skin friction and pressure, xxxxxx Stress Sensitive Film (S3F). This technique can operate over a range of temperatures from cryogenic (160 K, -113aC) to well above ambient (470 K, 197aC). The operation of the sensor is based on the deformations of an elastic film that distorts under the action of the applied normal and tangential loads. Skin friction and pressure gradients are determined by monitoring these distortions and applying a finite element model to the film. Quantitative measurements of skin friction and pressure have been demonstrated on aerodynamic models from 10-m/s to xxxxxx. Among these tests was an experiment that included S3F on one side of the model and PSP on the other side. xxxxxx from each sensor was acquired simultaneously, thus demonstrating the compatibility of the S3F with existing PSP hardware. Tunnels with existing PSP systems could be upgraded to include skin friction capability. The opportunity to develop this sensor system for measurements of skin friction in production facilities, including cryogenic tunnels as well as tunnels with operating temperatures up to 200C, is recognized and this is the focus of this proposal.	13289
A Numerical Method to Generate Reference Trajectories for Optimization Methods to Support Low-Thrust Mission Design	2020-08-01	2018-07-19	The recent success of missions employing low thrust propulsion systems has demonstrated the promise this technology holds for a wide array of future applications, from asteroid tours, to missions to xxxxxx. Low-thrust spacecraft motion is governed by a sensitive system of nonlinear differential equations, and this makes finding desirable trajectories challenging. Current low-thrust trajectory design methods rely heavily on optimization techniques to obtain feasible trajectories. These techniques require an initial guess for the spacecraft trajectory and this guess heavily impacts the final optimized trajectory. Many locally optimal trajectories are available and a precise initial guess can lead to the most desirable locally, or even globally, optimal trajectory. Despite the importance of a good initial guess in low-thrust trajectory design, relatively few comprehensive methods exist for creating these guesses. A method for generating a wide array of initial guesses and selecting one that best fits a set of preferred criteria is desirable because it would expand the range of possible low-thrust trajectories. One tool that shows promise for developing initial guesses for low-thrust trajectories is the theory of invariant manifolds. In astrodynamics, invariant manifolds can be thought of as structures that show the natural flow of gravitational forces about a periodic orbit. The manifolds of low-thrust periodic orbits are likely helpful for producing a range of detailed initial guesses for low-thrust trajectories. The proposed investigation will study how the manifolds of low-thrust periodic orbits can be used to produce improved initial guesses for low-thrust spacecraft trajectories. The study will begin by computing low-thrust periodic orbits and obtaining the manifolds of these orbits. Following this, a variety of visualization methods will be employed to understand manifold behavior, these include Poincare maps and three-dimensional plots. The intuition gained from these visualizations will be used to develop a scheme for categorizing manifold behavior. Understanding gained from visualization and categorization will be applied to low-thrust mission design. A number of realistic mission scenarios will be tested, including polesitting orbits and transfers from the xxxxxxxxxxxx system to other bodies. It is important to note that a spacecraft can leverage the manifolds of a low-thrust periodic orbit without entering the orbit. Therefore, a low-thrust periodic orbit does not need to be the final destination of a spacecraft in order for this mission design method to be of use. The proposed mission design method will first identify low-thrust periodic orbits whose manifolds provide access to the desired regions of space. Next, the method will calculate the manifolds which provide the preferred trajectory characteristics at the lowest cost. The result of this determination will be used as an initial guess in an optimization technique. Finally, the resulting solution will be tested in a higher fidelity model. This entire process will be made as autonomous as possible to allow for ease of use by mission designers. The improved initial guesses generated by this method will produce superior locally optimal trajectories, which could entail fuel or time savings for spacecraft. Therefore, mission design strategies produced by this study could yield innovative trajectories that would reduce mission cost and increase scientific return. Furthermore, this research will yield methods for understanding the stability of low-thrust enabled periodic orbits. The potential of low-thrust spacecraft has only begun to be realized. Investment in astrodynamics research will expand the space attainable by these spacecraft, opening up new regions of space for science and exploration by xxxxxx and its partners.	13290
