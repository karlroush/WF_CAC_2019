Novel Hybrid Propulsion System for Sample Return Missions, Phase I	2016-12-01	2018-07-19	xxxxxxbilis xxxxxx Technologies is pleased to propose an innovative hybrid motor propulsion solution utilizing a novel bi-axial grain design in response to solicitation xxxxxx, xxxxxx xxxxxx for Sample xxxxxx xxxxxx. Due to the innovative motor design, the proposed system is significantly shorter than a conventional hybrid motor system but maintains safety, reduced complexity, and storability advantages of hybrid motor systems. The system leverages additive manufacturing for the rocket nozzle and injector system in order to decrease both weight and part count. This innovation is an ideal propulsion technology for a variety of sample return missions from xxxxxx or other bodies with significant gravity wells.	12289
PHOENIX MARS METEOROLOGICAL PRESSURE / TEMPERATURE EDR V1.0	2018-06-26	2018-07-19	The PHX METEOROLOGICAL DATA product contains pre-processed (Digital Numbers) temperature and pressure data. The temperature data was collected at 250, 500 and 1000mm above xxxxxx deck, and the pressure data was collected at (nearly) the height of the xxxxxx deck. Nominally the data was collected at 2 sec resolution, but is also provided at 512 sec averages (with distribution statistics).	12290
3D Flash LIDARAll Weathr Safety, Phase I	2015-12-01	2018-07-19	ASC has developed non-scanning 3D xxxxxxTM imagers for UAS situational awareness and autonomous landing.  This sensing technology is the most advanced LIDAR technology available for UAV guidance and landing site determination.  ASC's array technology has allowed for compact LIDAR cameras that collect full frame 3D point clouds in a single FLASH (xxxxxx).  The 3D days will improve the mobility, efficiency and safety of air transportation systems.  ASC's xxxxxx is the LIDAR in xxxxxx and xxxxxx xxxxxx (ALHAT) for xxxxxx.   The 3D xxxxxx captured the 3D data used in landing site selection and hazard avoidance during the xxxxxx autonomous landing demonstrations.  ASC will use a miniaturized version, of the core 3D xxxxxx technology used for ALHAT, to develop an autonomous landing and hazard avoidance sensor for UAVs operating in national airspace.  The sensor will be capable of a number of autonomous navigation functions, but the xxxxxx I effort will focus on demonstrating unique functions of the sensor.  The first demonstration will address safe xxxxxx Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operation in the first and last 50 ft under diverse weather conditions.	12291

[2006]. The xxxxxx 2(V2)inversion (or retrieval)products are summarized below. These products are available through the internal analysis system&#x0022;demonstrat&#x0022; and the xxxxxxNET website. Adetailed description of V2 xxxxxxNET retrieval will be provided in the paper by xxxxxx, [2006b].	12292
Collaborative Outbound Taxi Metering for Environmental Benefits, Phase I	2008-07-01	2018-07-19	This proposal addresses the concept of Collaborative Outbound Taxi xxxxxxing (COTM), which provides environmental benefits without sacrificing throughput.  In current operations, departure flights must block out of their parking gates to claim their first-come, first-served departure slot.  When departure demand exceeds capacity, flights experience delay in departure queues near the runway.  The need for flights to make incremental steps in the queue significantly increases the engine emissions produced because of the number of times aircraft must apply 'break-away' power, only to stop again after moving just a short distance.  Under the COTM concept, metering techniques assign and maintain departure slots for all departure flights even if aircraft remain at their parking gates.  xxxxxx has conducted initial analysis using historical operational data demonstrating the potential environmental benefits even in the presence of arrival flights requiring parking gates.  This concept has already been applied and shown significant benefits during over-night operations of air cargo carriers.  Implementing the concept across the entire NAS has not been possible due to the requirement to coordinate departure metering amongst multiple airport users.  We propose to further demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the COTM concept at large hub airports.	12293
